00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:15.194
For the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey
接下来的一刻钟，我要带大家踏上一段旅程

2
00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.304
that is probably the biggest dream of humanity:
这大概是全人类的终极梦想——

3
00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:20.343
to understand the code of life.
解读生命的密码！

4
00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:23.635
So for me, everything started many, many years ago
我的经历开始于很多很多年以前，

5
00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.382
when I met the first 3D printer.
那时我遇到了第一台3D打印机。

6
00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:28.080
The concept was fascinating.
3D打印真是个非常赞的概念

7
00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:30.126
A 3D printer needs three elements:
它需要三个要素：

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.996
a bit of information, some raw material, some energy,
少量的信息，一些原材料，再加上点能量

9
00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:37.658
and it can produce any object that was not there before.
就能制造出以前从没存在过的任何东西。

10
00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:39.897
I was doing physics, I was coming back home
当时我正在研究物理学

11
00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:43.737
and I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer.
有天我回到家，突然意识到我家里就有台3D打印机

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.296
And everyone does.
而且每人家里都有一台

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.478
It was my mom.
就是我妈妈。

14
00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:47.503
(Laughter)
我妈妈用这三个要素：

15
00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:49.941
My mom takes three elements:
少量的信息——

16
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:53.938
a bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case,
来自我爸和我妈的共同投入

17
00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:58.119
raw elements and energy in the same media, that is food,
原材料和能量的共同来源——食物

18
00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:00.651
and after several months, produces me.
历时几个月，制造出了我

19
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:02.487
And I was not existent before.
而我以前从来没有存在过！

20
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:06.273
So apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer,
除了震惊的发现我妈其实是台3D打印机

21
00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:11.035
I immediately got mesmerized by that piece,
我还立即被另一个部分吸引了

22
00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:12.776
the first one, the information.
第一个要素，信息——

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.051
What amount of information does it take
到底需要多少信息

24
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.011
to build and assemble a human?
才能制造和组装一个人呢？

25
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.609
Is it much? Is it little?
是要很多？还是很少？

26
00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:20.813
How many thumb drives can you fill?
要用多少个U盘去储存？

27
00:01:20.837 --> 00:01:23.461
Well, I was studying physics at the beginning
我最开始是学物理的，

28
00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:29.082
and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece.
我想如果把人看成是一个巨型的乐高玩具

29
00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:32.891
So, imagine that the building blocks are little atoms
小的乐高模块就像是原子——

30
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:37.568
and there is a hydrogen here, a carbon here, a nitrogen here.
这里有氢原子，这边有碳原子，上面这有氮原子。

31
00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.163
So in the first approximation,
按照最初的这个设定

32
00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:43.530
if I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being,
如果能够列出组成人类的所有原子

33
00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:44.941
I can build it.
应该就能组装出一个人。

34
00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.994
Now, you can run some numbers
大致计算一下

35
00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:50.295
and that happens to be quite an astonishing number.
得到的结果非常惊人。

36
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.076
So the number of atoms,
所需要的原子的总数，

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.855
the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby,
全部存到U盘里面——即便是组装一个小婴儿

38
00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.546
will actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives --
用掉的U盘就能装满整个泰坦尼克号

39
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.288
multiplied 2,000 times.
再乘以2000倍...

40
00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:09.178
This is the miracle of life.
这就是生命的奇迹。

41
00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:11.814
Every time you see from now on a pregnant lady,
现在你再看到一个孕妇

42
00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:16.274
she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter.
她正在组装你能见到的最大量的信息

43
00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:19.248
Forget big data, forget anything you heard of.
不要谈大数据，不要谈以前听说过的数字

44
00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:22.153
This is the biggest amount of information that exists.
这就是现存的，最最大量的信息。

45
00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:26.010
(Applause)
（掌声）

46
00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:30.678
But nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young physicist,
但是...... 好在大自然比一个年轻的物理学家要聪明多了。

47
00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:37.007
and in four billion years, managed to pack this information in a small crystal we call DNA.
在四十亿年的进化过程中这些信息被压缩在叫做DNA的小晶体当中。

48
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.737
We met it for the first time in 1950 when Rosalind Franklin,
在1950年代我们第一次知道了DNA

49
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.317
an amazing scientist, a woman,
那时一位杰出的女科学家Rosalind Franklin

50
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:44.730
took a picture of it.
给DNA拍了张照

51
00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:51.568
But it took us more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell, take out this crystal,
但我们花了超过40年的时间，才最终能够从人类细胞中提取这种晶体，

52
00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.672
unroll it, and read it for the first time.
展开来，第一次去阅读它。

53
00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:58.676
The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet,
这个遗传密码由简单的字母表组成，

54
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.472
four letters: A, T, C and G.
四个字母，A，T，C和G （碱基）。

55
00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:05.986
And to build a human, you need three billion of them.
要组装一个人，需要30亿个字母。

56
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.535
Three billion. How many are three billion?
30亿....30亿是多少？

57
00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.321
It doesn't really make any sense as a number, right?
光这么说大家可能都没概念，

58
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:16.430
So I was thinking how I could explain myself better
我在想怎么表达才能让人更清楚，

59
00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:19.504
about how big and enormous this code is.
这些遗传密码的数量到底有多庞大。

60
00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:22.582
But there is -- I mean, I'm going to have some help,
所以...我需要点帮助...

61
00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.833
and the best person to help me introduce the code
最合适来帮我介绍遗传密码的人，

62
00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:29.379
is actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.
就是第一位进行人类基因组测序的人，Craig Venter 博士。

63
00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:32.793
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.
我们欢迎Craig Venter博士到台上来——

64
00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:39.748
(Applause)
（掌声）

65
00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:42.028
Not the man in the flesh,
不是他本人——

66
00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:49.099
but for the first time in history, this is the genome of a specific human,
但这是史上第一次，一个人的基因组

67
00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.899
printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:
被一页一页，一个字母一个字母的打印在纸上——

68
00:03:52.907 --> 00:03:58.117
262,000 pages of information, 450 kilograms,

71
00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:07.602
It was an amazing feat.
他们负责完成了这一切，一项壮举。

72
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.966
But this is the visual perception of what is the code of life.
这些就是生命密码给人最直观的视觉感受。

73
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.468
And now, for the first time, I can do something fun.
现在我可以来玩点有趣的——

74
00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:17.039
I can actually poke inside it and read.
从这里面挑一段来读一读。

75
00:04:17.063 --> 00:04:21.688
So let me take an interesting book ... like this one.

80
00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:42.672
Let's get to a specific part.
让我来找一段特殊的

108
00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:12.334
So think about that again when we think that we are different.
讨论人与人差异的时候反思一下，

109
00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:14.579
This is the amount that we share.
我们有这么多共通的东西。

110
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.690
So now that I have your attention,

115
00:06:27.493 --> 00:06:31.056
this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life.
这么长的说明书...基本是不可能完成的任务

116
00:06:32.707 --> 00:06:35.819
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,
2014年，两位著名的TED参加者

127
00:07:05.797 --> 00:07:08.050
The concept is actually very simple.

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:11.232
We're going to use a technology called machine learning.

130
00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.816
On the other side, we collected the biggest database of human beings:
另一边我们建立一个超大的人类信息数据库：

131
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.136
phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR -- everything you can think of.
性状，3D扫描，核磁共振，所有能想到的

132
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.059
Inside there, on these two opposite sides,

136
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.240
well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines --

137
00:07:38.264 --> 00:07:42.808
to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype.
试图去理解基因组并把它翻译成性状。

138
00:07:43.182 --> 00:07:46.522
What are those letters, and what do they do?

139
00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:49.293
It's an approach that can be used for everything,

140
00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:52.310
but using it in genomics is particularly complicated.

141
00:07:52.334 --> 00:07:55.610
Little by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges.
一点一点有了进展，我们再尝试更有挑战性的东西

142
00:07:55.634 --> 00:07:58.366
We started from the beginning, from common traits.
最开始我们从常见的特征下手，

143
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.993
Common traits are comfortable because they are common,
常见特征最容易因为它们太常见了，

144
00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:02.201
everyone has them.
每个人都有。

145
00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:04.719
So we started to ask our questions:
我们开始提出如下问题：

146
00:08:04.743 --> 00:08:06.123
Can we predict height?
能预测身高吗？

147
00:08:06.805 --> 00:08:08.982
Can we read the books and predict your height?
能不能根据这些信息预测身高？

148
00:08:09.006 --> 00:08:11.974
Well, we actually can, with five centimeters of precision.
可以，在5厘米的误差范围以内。

149
00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:15.133
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,
BMI 主要跟生活习惯有关，

150
00:08:15.157 --> 00:08:19.021
but we still can, we get in the ballpark, eight kilograms of precision.
但我们仍然能预测得差不多，8千克上下的误差。

151
00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:20.276
Can we predict eye color?
眼睛的颜色能不能预测？

152
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.806
Yeah, we can. Eighty percent accuracy.
可以，80%准确率。

153
00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:25.144
Can we predict skin color?
皮肤颜色？

154
00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:27.609
Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.
可以，80%准确。

155
00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:28.973
Can we predict age?
年龄？

156
00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:33.680
We can, because apparently, the code changes during your life.
可以，因为很明显基因随着年龄产生变化。

157
00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:36.986
It gets shorter, you lose pieces, it gets insertions.
DNA 会变短，缺失一些片段，插入另外一些片段

158
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.565
We read the signals, and we make a model.
我们读取这些信号，然后建立模型。

159
00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:41.733
Now, an interesting challenge:
现在来个有意思点的挑战：

160
00:08:41.757 --> 00:08:43.486
Can we predict a human face?
我们能不能预测人的面孔？

161
00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:46.112
It's a little complicated,
这个略有点复杂，

162
00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:49.327
because a human face is scattered among millions of these letters.
因为有几百万个碱基都对人脸产生影响。

163
00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:51.980
And a human face is not a very well-defined object.
而且人脸并不是一个构造十分精准的物体。

164
00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:54.055
So, we had to build an entire tier of it
所以必须要建立一整个单独的模块，

165
00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:56.789
to learn and teach a machine what a face is,
给机器去训练和学习人脸是什么，

166
00:08:56.813 --> 00:08:58.850
and embed and compress it.
再把这个模块压缩整合进去。

167
00:08:58.874 --> 00:09:01.122
And if you're comfortable with machine learning,
如果你对机器学习有点概念的话，

168
00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:03.430
you understand what the challenge is here.
就能够想象这个挑战是有多大。

169
00:09:03.928 --> 00:09:09.919
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after we read the first sequence --
现在15年过去了——15年前我们读取第一条序列

170
00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:12.845
this October, we started to see some signals.
——今年10月，我们总算有了些进展，

171
00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:15.324
And it was a very emotional moment.
当时还是很激动人心的。

172
00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:21.367
What you see here is a subject coming in our lab. This is a face for us.
这是我们的一个测试对象，一张人的脸——

173
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:25.022
So we take the real face of a subject, we reduce the complexity,
我们要对测试对象的面孔进行简化，

174
00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:27.016
because not everything is in your face --
因为并不是所有的特征都是面孔的一部分——

175
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.826
lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life.
很多特点、缺陷和不对称是生活的痕迹。

176
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.319
We symmetrize the face, and we run our algorithm.
把面孔调整对称之后，跟我们运算的结果比较。

177
00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:40.359
The results that I show you right now, this is the prediction we have from the blood.
现在给你们看，我们根据血液样本生成的预测。

178
00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:42.940
(Applause)
（掌声）

179
00:09:42.964 --> 00:09:44.399
Wait a second.
等一下——

180
00:09:44.423 --> 00:09:49.115
In these seconds, your eyes are watching, left and right, left and right,
你们的眼睛正在左右两边交替看，

181
00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:53.069
and your brain wants those pictures to be identical.
大脑希望两幅图是一模一样的。

182
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.539
So I ask you to do another exercise, to be honest.
我其实想请大家反过来，

183
00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:59.235
Please search for the differences, which are many.
找找两幅图的不同点，其实非常多。

184
00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:01.862
The biggest amount of signal comes from gender,
性别提供最多的信息，

185
00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:07.087
then there is age, BMI, the ethnicity component of a human.
接下来是年龄，BMI（体质指数），种族；

186
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:10.822
And scaling up over that signal is much more complicated.
再考虑更多因素会变得更加复杂。

187
00:10:10.846 --> 00:10:14.096
But what you see here, even in the differences,
但是这样的结果，即便有很多不同，

188
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.715
lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark,
表示我们已经接近了，

189
00:10:17.739 --> 00:10:21.460
that we are getting closer. And it's already giving you some emotions.
正在逐渐靠得更近——而且这已经能够鼓舞人心了

190
00:10:21.484 --> 00:10:24.187
This is another subject that comes in place,
这是另外一个测试对象，

191
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.620
and this is a prediction.
这边是预测结果。

192
00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:30.240
A little smaller face, we didn't get the complete cranial structure,
脸小了一点，完整的颅骨结构没预测到。

193
00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:32.915
but still, it's in the ballpark.
但至少像那么回事。

194
00:10:33.454 --> 00:10:35.678
This is a subject that comes in our lab,
这是又一个测试对象，

195
00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.145
and this is the prediction.
这是预测结果。

196
00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:42.552
So these people have never been seen in the training of the machine.
这些面孔在训练机器的时候是没有用过的，

197
00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:45.413
These are the so-called "held-out" set.
就是所谓的随机测试组。

198
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:49.177
But these are people that you will probably never believe.
并且你们不认识这些人，可能说服力不太够。

199
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.877
We're publishing everything in a scientific publication,
我们在学术期刊上发表了这些结果，

200
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.052
you can read it.
你们可以去读一下。

201
00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:55.420
But since we are onstage, Chris challenged me.
但既然我们在台上，Chris给我出了个点子，

202
00:10:55.444 --> 00:11:01.925
I probably exposed myself and tried to predict someone that you might recognize.
我可以挑战一下，尝试预测一个你们都认识的人。

203
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:06.715
So, in this vial of blood -- and believe me, you have no idea
这里有管血液——你们很难想象

204
00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:09.619
what we had to do to have this blood now, here --
我们为了带一管血液到这里花了多少工夫...

205
00:11:09.643 --> 00:11:15.845
in this vial of blood is the amount of biological information that we need to do a full genome sequence.
这支试管里的血液足够完成一次全基因组测序

206
00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:17.939
We just need this amount.
只需要这么多。

207
00:11:18.348 --> 00:11:21.553
We ran this sequence, and I'm going to do it with you.
完成了测序，下面我们一条条来看——

208
00:11:21.577 --> 00:11:25.556
And we start to layer up all the understanding we have.
我们综合了所有已知的信息——

209
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.930
In the vial of blood, we predicted he's a male.
从血液测试的结果，我们预测这是一名男性，

210
00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.318
And the subject is a male.
被试是男性。

211
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:33.254
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.
预测他身高1米76，

212
00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:35.670
The subject is a meter and 77 cm.
被试身高1米77。

213
00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:39.804
So, we predicted that he's 76; the subject is 82.
预测他体重76kg，被试是82kg；

214
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:43.153
We predict his age, 38.
我们还预测了年龄，38岁

215
00:11:43.177 --> 00:11:45.081
The subject is 35.
被试实际是35岁。

216
00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:49.855
We predict his eye color. Too dark.
预测了眼睛的颜色，有点偏深了；

217
00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:51.434
We predict his skin color.
预测他的皮肤颜色，

218
00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:53.256
We are almost there.
基本上准确。

219
00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:55.092
That's his face.
这是他的面孔...

220
00:11:56.992 --> 00:12:00.261
Now, the reveal moment:
现在到了揭晓的时刻：

221
00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:02.055
the subject is this person.
被试对象是这个人。

222
00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:04.014
(Laughter)
（笑声）

223
00:12:04.038 --> 00:12:06.096
And I did it intentionally.
我是有意拿自己做测试的，

224
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.812
I am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity.
我属于一个特别又特殊的种族,

225
00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:12.786
Southern European, Italians -- they never fit in models.
南欧人，意大利人——从来都不符合模型预测。

226
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.940
And it's particular -- that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model.
而且这一种族在模型里是一个复杂的边界情况。

227
00:12:17.964 --> 00:12:19.473
But there is another point.
但还有另一个重点——

228
00:12:19.497 --> 00:12:22.974
So, one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people
最常用的来辨识人的方法，

229
00:12:22.998 --> 00:12:24.720
will never be written in the genome.
不是由基因组编译的。

230
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.061
It's our free will, it's how I look.
是人们的自由意志——我想让自己看起来怎么样，

231
00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:30.314
Not my haircut in this case, but my beard cut.
虽然我的发型不是我自己决定的，但胡子是的。

232
00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:33.891
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, transfer it --
下面我们来看一下——

233
00:12:33.915 --> 00:12:36.680
and this is nothing more than Photoshop, no modeling --
单纯的用photoshop，不用建模——

234
00:12:36.704 --> 00:12:38.417
the beard on the subject.
把胡子加上去。

235
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.913
And immediately, we get much, much better in the feeling.
是不是立即觉得变得很相像了。

236
00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:45.484
So, why do we do this?
那么，我们为什么要研究这些？

237
00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:52.898
We certainly don't do it for predicting height
当然不是为了预测身高，

238
00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:55.294
or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood.
或者是根据血液样本得到一张美照；

239
00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.228
We do it because the same technology and the same approach,
我们研究是因为同样的技术和手段——

240
00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:02.772
the machine learning of this code,
对基因组的机器学习，

241
00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:05.933
is helping us to understand how we work,
能帮助我们了解人类自身，

242
00:13:05.957 --> 00:13:09.132
how your body works, how your body ages,
你的身体怎么运作，身体如何老化，

243
00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:11.925
how disease generates in your body,
疾病是如何产生的，

244
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:14.921
how your cancer grows and develops,
癌症是怎么出现和恶化的；

245
00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:16.728
how drugs work
药物如何起作用——

246
00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:19.066
and if they work on your body.
药物是不是能够对你有效。

247
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.200
This is a huge challenge.
这是一个巨大的挑战，

248
00:13:21.714 --> 00:13:25.955
This is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world.
而且是一个全球的科学家都面临的挑战

249
00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:28.201
It's called personalized medicine.
——个性化医疗。

250
00:13:28.945 --> 00:13:32.405
It's the ability to move from a statistical approach
从只能借助统计学方法——

251
00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:34.461
where you're a dot in the ocean,
每个人都只是沧海一粟——

252
00:13:34.485 --> 00:13:36.298
to a personalized approach,
到能够实现有针对性的治疗，

253
00:13:36.322 --> 00:13:38.507
where we read all these books
通过解码这些基因信息，

254
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:41.395
and we get an understanding of exactly how you are.
我们能够彻底了解每一个人。

255
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.442
But it is a particularly complicated challenge,
但这是一项异常复杂的挑战，

256
00:13:45.466 --> 00:13:49.464
because of all these books, as of today,
因为到目前为止在这么庞大的基因组信息中，

257
00:13:49.488 --> 00:13:52.130
we just know probably two percent:
我们大概只了解2%：

258
00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:56.500
four books of more than 175.
175本书里的4本...

259
00:13:57.841 --> 00:14:01.047
And this is not the topic of my talk,
当然这不是我今天演讲的主题，

260
00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:04.563
because we will learn more.
因为我们会进步，会了解更多——

261
00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:07.867
There are the best minds in the world on this topic.
有很多顶尖的人才在从事这项工作。

262
00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:12.979
The prediction will get better, the model will get more precise.
预测能力会提升，模型会更准确。

263
00:14:13.003 --> 00:14:14.861
And the more we learn,
随着了解的逐渐深入，

264
00:14:14.885 --> 00:14:19.715
the more we will be confronted with decisions
我们需要做的决定会越来越多，

265
00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:22.760
that we never had to face before
而且是一些从前没有想象过的决定——

266
00:14:22.784 --> 00:14:27.544
about life, about death, about parenting.
关于生，关于死，关于子孙后代...

267
00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:37.922
So, we are touching the very inner detail on how life works.
所以我们在此的讨论，涉及生命最本质的东西，

268
00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:43.779
And it's a revolution that cannot be confined in the domain of science or technology.
这些改变不只是在科学和技术层面。

269
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.024
This must be a global conversation.
我们必须要有全球性的对话，

270
00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:52.835
We must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity.
必须要为全人类的未来设想。

271
00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:56.923
We need to interact with creatives, with artists, with philosophers,
我们需要和创新人才、艺术家、哲学家交流，

272
00:14:56.947 --> 00:14:58.457
with politicians.
还需要政治家的参与。

273
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:02.488
Everyone is involved, because it's the future of our species.
每个人都身在其中，因为这关乎人类的未来。

274
00:15:03.093 --> 00:15:07.061
Without fear, but with the understanding
不需要惊慌——

275
00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:10.956
that the decisions that we make in the next year
但必须了解我们现在做出的每一项决定，

276
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.769
will change the course of history forever.
都会彻底改变历史。

277
00:15:15.552 --> 00:15:16.712
Thank you.
谢谢。

278
00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:26.895
(Applause)
（持久的掌声）
