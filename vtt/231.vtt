You spend a good part of the time crying, probably.

When you think about --

26
00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:26.590
when you think about the opposite of work,

你会说，噢， 我需要一些闲暇时间，等等。

32
00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:43.230
It's a very crowded thing that we do.

The opposite of work is idleness.
其实工作的反义词是”无所事事“。

34
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.765
But very few of us know what to do with idleness.
不过很少有人知道要怎么 才能做到无所事事。

35
00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.822
When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general,
你可以大致看一下我们是 如何分配这一生的，

36
00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:58.381
you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money,

37
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.378
we have very little time.

38
00:02:00.378 --> 00:02:05.405
And then when we finally have time, we have neither the money nor the health.
当我们有时间的时候， 却没什么钱，身体也出了状况。

39
00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:10.025
So we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years.
于是在过去的三十年中， 我们一直在以运营公司的方式思考这个问题。

40
00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.196
This is a complicated company with thousands of employees,

41
00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.556
hundreds of millions of dollars of business

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:22.109
that makes rocket fuel propellent systems, runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,

does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands.

44
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:29.078
So this is not a simple business.

45
00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:31.206
We looked at it and we said,
我们看着这一切说，

46
00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:36.074
let's devolve to these people, let's give these people a company

47
00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.454
where we take away all the boarding school aspects
我们把董事会所有那些 条条框框的部分去掉，

48
00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:40.843
of, this is when you arrive, this is how you dress,
比如你要什么时间来， 你要如何打扮，

49
00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:43.405
this is how you go to meetings, this is what you say,
你要如何参加会议， 你要说些什么，

50
00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:44.066
this is what you don't say,

51
00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:46.232
and let's see what's left.
再看看接下来会如何。

52
00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.062
So we started this about 30 years ago,
我们30年前就开始这样做了，

53
00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:50.587
and we started dealing with this very issue.
开始着手处理这个事情。

54
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.784
And so we said, look, the retirement,
于是我们说，看吧，退休，

55
00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:55.926
the whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life.
这就是我们如何分配生命的问题。

56
00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:59.083
Instead of going mountain climbing when you're 82,
与其等到82岁的时候再去登山，

57
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:01.256
why don't you do it next week?
你为什么不下周就动身呢？

58
00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:02.611
And we'll do it like this,
我们一般会这样做，

59
00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:07.007
we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary.
我们会以你工资10%的价格 把你的周三返卖给你。

60
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:11.260
So now, if you were going to be  a violinist, which you probably weren't,
这样一来，如果你想要成为一个小提琴家， 但这个愿望还没有实现，

61
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.414
you go and do this on Wednesday.
你就可以在周三去做。

62
00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:14.761
And what we found --
我们发现——

63
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.298
we thought, these are the older people
我们认为，真正对这个项目感兴趣的

00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:19.897
who are going to be really interested in this program.
都会是些资历更老的人。

65
00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.351
And the average age of the first people who adhered
当然，第一批参与这个项目的人的

66
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:23.799
were 29, of course.
平均年龄是29岁。

67
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.157
And so we started looking,
我们开始了观察，

68
00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:27.657
and we said, we have to do things in a different way.
我们决定，要以一种不同的方式来运作。

69
00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:29.428
So we started saying things like,
于是我们开始这样说，

70
00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:31.802
why do we want to know what time you came to work,
为什么我们想要知道你什么时间去工作，

71
00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:33.053
what time you left, etc.?
什么时间下班之类的信息？

72
00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:35.407
Can't we exchange this for a contract
我们难道不能以此为交换签署一个合同，

73
00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:38.869
for buying something from you, some kind of work?
从你那里购买点什么，比如一些工作？

74
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:40.890
Why are we building these headquarters?
我们为什么要建立这么多总部？

75
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.658
Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid
这不是一个关于我们想要高瞻远瞩进行

76
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.537
and big and important?
自我提升的问题吗？

77
00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:48.821
But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it?
但我们是因为这个才让你们 花2个小时从城那头跑过来干活儿的吗？

78
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:52.352
So we started asking questions one by one.
于是我们开始一个接一个的提问。

79
00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:53.745
We'd say it like this:
我们会这样描述它：

80
00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.027
One: How do we find people?
一：我们怎样招聘？

81
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:59.210
We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say,

82
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.763
look, when you come to us,
看，当你来找我们，

83
00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:02.985
we're not going to have two or three interviews

84
00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:05.397
and then you're going to be married to us for life.
然后你就需要一辈子为我们效力。

85
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.417
That's not how we do  the rest of our lives.
这不是我们利用余下生命的方式。

86
00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:09.652
So, come have your interviews.
那么，来参加面试吧。

87
00:04:09.652 --> 00:04:13.088
Anyone who's interested in interviewing, you will show up.
任何对面试感兴趣的人，都会出现。

88
00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:17.081
And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that,
然后我们会看到从由此产生的 直觉之外能获得什么，

89
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:21.123
instead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person.
而不只是通过填写表格来判断 你是不是最佳人选。

90
00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:23.240
And then, come back.
然后再让你回来。

91
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.301
Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day, talk to anybody you want.

Make sure we are the bride  you thought we were
确定我们是你想找的对象，

93
00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:32.425
and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads.
别被我们广告里的写的破玩意儿忽悠了。

94
00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:34.501
(Laughter)
（笑声）

95
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:38.197
Slowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like,
慢慢的我们进入了一个过程， 我们会这样说，

96
00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:40.958
we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company

97
00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.101
if they haven't been  interviewed and approved
面试和肯定的人成为

98
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:45.952
by their future subordinates.
公司的领导。

99
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:50.829
Every six months, everyone gets  evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.
每半年，每个人都要以领导的身份 接受匿名评估。

100
00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:55.440
And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position,
这决定了他们是否应该 继续在领导层任职，

101
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.230
which is many times situational, as you know.
多数情况下都是场景面试， 这个你们应该了解。

102
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.284
And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent  of a grade, they don't stay,
如果他们得不到百分之七八十的肯定， 他们就得走人，

103
00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:08.623
which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.
这可能就是我已经从CEO的位子上 下来了10多年的原因。

104
00:05:08.623 --> 00:05:12.519
And over time, we started asking other questions.
过了一段时间， 我们开始问其他的问题。

105
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.035
We said things like,
我们会说，

106
00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:17.364
why can't people set their own salaries?
为什么员工不能自己定薪水？

107
00:05:17.364 --> 00:05:18.940
What do they need to know?
他们需要知道什么？

108
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.003
There's only three things  you need to know:
你只需要知道3件事：

109
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:23.338
how much people make inside the company,
员工在公司内部创造了多少价值，

110
00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:26.207
how much people make somewhere else in a similar business
员工在别的地方的类似公司 创造了多少价值，

111
00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:29.499
and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it.
以及整体上我们付出了多少努力 才能负担得起这些薪水？

112
00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.084
So let's give people these three pieces of information.
那么我们提供给人们这三样信息。

113
00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:34.092
So we started having, in the cafeteria,
于是在公司的就餐区，

114
00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:36.593
a computer where you could go in  and you could ask
我们设立了一台计算机， 你可以进去查询

117
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.580
what the margins are, and so forth.
还有多少利润，等等。

118
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.342
And this is 25 years ago.
这是在25年以前。

119
00:05:47.272 --> 00:05:50.007
As this information started  coming to people,
当人们开始接触这些信息，

120
00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:53.116
we said things like, we don't want  to see your expense report,
我们会说， 我们对你们的花费报告没有兴趣，

121
00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:55.688
we don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking,
不想知道你们花了多少天休假，

122
00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:57.600
we don't want to know where you work.
也不想知道你们在哪工作。

123
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.576
We had, at one point, 14 different offices around town,
我们在某个时期在一个城镇 有14个不同的办公室，

124
00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:03.970
and we'd say, go to the one  that's closest to your house,
我们会说，去那个离你家最近，

125
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.471
to the customer that  you're going to visit today.
离你今天要见的客户最近的地方上班。

126
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:08.590
Don't tell us where you are.
不要告诉我们你在哪。

127
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.715
And more, even when we had thousands of people, 5,000 people,
还有，即便我们有几千个雇员， 5000人左右，

128
00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:16.093
we had two people in the H.R. department,
我们的HR部门只有2个人，

129
00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:18.491
and thankfully one of them has retired.
谢天谢地其中一个已经退休了。

130
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.450
(Laughter)
（笑声）

131
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.204
And so, the question we were asking was, how can we be taking care of people?
那么我们问的问题就是， 我们要怎么关心员工呢？

132
00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:26.007
People are the only thing we have.
员工是我们拥有的一切。

133
00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:29.445
We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people.
我们无法设立一个部门专门 照顾员工们的日常事务。

134
00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:34.826
So as we started finding that this worked, and we'd say, we're looking for --
于是当我们开始发现这种方式能够奏效， 我们就开始寻找——

135
00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:37.521
and this is, I think, the main thing I was looking for
我觉得这是我在公司时的终结日里

136
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.564
in the terminal days and in the company,
重点要探索的东西，

137
00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:43.133
which is, how do you set up for wisdom?
就是说，我们要怎样让公司 以更睿智的方式运作？

138
00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:47.809
We've come from an age of revolution, industrial revolution,
我们已经走过了革命时代， 工业革命，

139
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:50.492
an age of information, an age of knowledge,
信息时代，知识时代，

140
00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:53.104
but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom.
但是我们从未走近过睿智时代。

141
00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:56.431
How we design, how do we organize, for more wisdom?
我们要如何更智慧的 进行设计和组织活动？

142
00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:57.974
So for example, many times,
比方说，有很多次，

143
00:06:57.974 --> 00:07:02.321
what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive.
最聪明或者最明智的决定并不奏效。

144
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.703
So we'd say things like,
我们就会说，

145
00:07:04.703 --> 00:07:08.710
let's agree that you're going to sell 57 widgets per week.
我们来做这样一个约定： 你每周要售出57个器件。

146
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.383
If you sell them by Wednesday,  please go to the beach.
如果你在周三前卖完，就赶紧去休假吧。

147
00:07:12.383 --> 00:07:16.094
Don't create a problem for us,  for manufacturing, for application,
不要给我们制造问题， 不管是在制造上还是应用上，

148
00:07:16.094 --> 00:07:19.197
then we have to buy new companies, we have to buy our competitors,
否则我们就得买新的公司， 我们就得把我们的竞争对手买下来，

149
00:07:18.987 --> 00:07:21.259
we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets.
就因为你卖了太多器件， 我们就得忙到不可开交。

150
00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.655
So go to the beach and start again on Monday.
所以赶紧去休假吧， 周一再回来继续干活儿。

151
00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:27.091
(Laughter) (Applause)
（笑声）（掌声）

152
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:30.430
So the process is looking for wisdom.
所以这个过程就是寻找智慧。

153
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.970
And in the process, of course,  we wanted people to know everything,
在这个过程中， 我们当然想让员工了解每件事，

154
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.339
and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things.
我们想要在一切行动中 都做到真正的民主。

155
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:43.030
So our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights,
所以我们的董事会还有2个 具有相同选举权的空位，

156
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.148
for the first two people who showed up.
先过来应征的2个人就能得到。

157
00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:46.716
(Laughter)
（笑声）

158
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:51.952
And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting,
于是我们的董事会上出现了 清洁工大妈在投票，

159
00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:55.048
which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties.
其他的都是西装革履的权高位重之人。

160
00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:58.677
And the fact is that they kept us honest.
事实就是他们让我们始终保持坦诚。

161
00:07:58.677 --> 00:08:02.426
This process, as we started looking at the people who came to us,
这个过程，当我们开始关注来应聘的人，

162
00:08:02.426 --> 00:08:04.004
we'd say, now wait a second,
我们会说，等一下，

163
00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.887
people come to us and they say, where am I supposed to sit?
来找我们的人会说， 我要坐在哪儿等呢？

164
00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:10.127
How am I supposed to work? Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?
我要怎么工作？ 工作5年之后我的职业发展是什么样子？

165
00:08:10.128 --> 00:08:13.206
And we looked at that and we said, we have to start much earlier.
我们看着这种情况说， 我们得早点行动。

166
00:08:12.716 --> 00:08:13.929
Where do we start?
我们要从哪儿开始呢？

167
00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:16.574
We said, oh, kindergarten  seems like a good place.
我们说，哦， 幼儿园看起来是个不错的地儿。

168
00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:21.401
So we set up a foundation, which now has,  for 11 years, three schools,
于是我们设立了一个基金，到目前为止， 在11年内已经开设了3所学校，

169
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.703
where we started asking the same questions,
在那里我们开始问同样的问题，

170
00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:26.615
how do you redesign school for wisdom?
你们要如何重新设计出更睿智的学校？

171
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:29.544
It is one thing to say, we need to recycle the teachers,
总结一下可以这么说， 我们需要更新师资队伍，

172
00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:31.218
we need the directors to do more.
我们需要校长做更多的事情。

173
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:37.153
But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete.
但事实是我们在教育上 做的事情已经完全过时了。

174
00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:39.651
The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.
教师的角色也已经完全过时了。

175
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:45.298
Going from a math class, to biology, to 14th-century France is very silly.
上完数学课，去上生物课， 再了解下14世纪的法国，这简直太傻了。

176
00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:50.004
(Applause)
（掌声）

177
00:08:50.004 --> 00:08:52.733
So we started thinking,  what could it look like?
于是我们开始想， 新式的学校应该是什么样子呢？

178
00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:56.302
And we put together people,  including people who like education,
我们把大家聚在一起， 他们当中包括热爱教育的人们，

179
00:08:56.302 --> 00:09:01.737
people like Paulo Freire,  and two ministers of education in Brazil
像保罗弗雷勒（巴西教育家，哲学家） 这样的人，还有巴西的教育部长们，

180
00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:04.406
and we said, if we were to design a school from scratch,
我们问，如果我们要 彻底重新建立一所学校，

181
00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:05.833
what would it look like?
应该是一所什么样的学校呢？

182
00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:09.566
And so we created this school, which is called Lumiar,
于是我们创立了这么一类学校， 叫做Lumiar，

183
00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.718
and Lumiar, one of them is a public school,
其中一所是公立学校，

184
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.524
and Lumiar says the following:
Lumiar的口号是这样的：

185
00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:17.701
Let's divide this role of the teacher into two.
我们要把教师的角色分成两部分。

186
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.062
One guy, we'll call a tutor.
其中一部分我们叫他家庭教师。

187
00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:25.037
A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek "paideia": Look after the kid.
一个家庭教师，古希腊语称作"paideia“： 也就是照看孩子的人。

188
00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:28.867
What's happening at home, what's their moment in life, etc..
主要负责家里杂事， 他们生命中的重要时刻，等等。

189
00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:30.207
But please don't teach,
但是不要教课，

190
00:09:30.207 --> 00:09:33.617
because the little you know compared  to Google, we don't want to know.
因为你知道的那点儿东西跟谷歌比起来 根本不算什么，我们也不想知道。

191
00:09:33.617 --> 00:09:34.769
Keep that to yourself.
你自己留着就好了。

192
00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:36.117
(Laughter)
（笑声）

193
00:09:35.147 --> 00:09:40.070
Now, we'll bring in people who have two things:
现在，我们主要招募的是 具备如下两个条件的人：

194
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.437
passion and expertise, and it could be their profession or not.
有热情，并且具备专业能力， 不过未必要跟他们从事的职业相关。

195
00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:46.354
And we use the senior citizens,
我们雇佣年长一些的公民，

196
00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:50.707
who are 25 percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.
他们占据了25%的人口， 具备其他人不具备的智慧。

197
00:09:50.707 --> 00:09:53.314
So we bring them to school and we say,
于是我们邀请他们来到学校，跟他们说，

198
00:09:53.314 --> 00:09:57.150
teach these kids whatever you really believe in.
教会这些孩子你们所信仰的东西。

199
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.766
So we have violinists teaching math.
于是我们的小提琴家在教授数学。

200
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.331
We have all kinds of things where we say,
在很多事情上我们都会说，

201
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.312
don't worry about  the course material anymore.
不要再担心教学材料了。

202
00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:10.276
We have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17.
我们大概有针对2-17岁年龄的 10种绝佳的设想。

203
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:14.666
Things like, how do we measure ourselves as humans?
例如，作为人类，我们要如何定位自己？

204
00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:18.292
So there's a place for math and physics and all that there.
于是就有了一个教授数学 和物理等学科的地方。

205
00:10:18.292 --> 00:10:20.156
How do we express ourselves?
我们要如何表达自己的想法和感受？

206
00:10:20.156 --> 00:10:22.561
So there's a place for music and literature, etc.,
于是就有了一个教授音乐 和文学的地方，等等，

207
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:24.205
but also for grammar.
还有语法。

208
00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:26.862
And then we have things that everyone has forgotten,
我们还做了一些几乎所有人 都忘记了的事，

209
00:10:26.862 --> 00:10:29.431
which are probably the most  important things in life.
这些可能是生命中最重要的事。

210
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:33.129
The very important things in life, we know nothing about.
生命中最重要的一些事， 我们却一无所知。

211
00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:35.369
We know nothing about love,
我们完全不了解爱，

212
00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:37.461
we know nothing about death,
完全不了解死亡，

213
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:39.538
we know nothing about why we're here.
我们完全不知道自己为什么会在这里。

214
00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:44.072
So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know.
所以我们需要学校提供一些思路 告诉我们每一件我们不知道的事。

215
00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:46.176
So that's a big part of what we do.
那就是我们工作的主要部分。

216
00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:51.771
(Applause)
（掌声）

217
00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:54.689
So over the years, we started going into other things.
过去的这些年，我们开始涉足其他领域。

218
00:10:54.689 --> 00:10:56.851
We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids
我们会问，为什么我们需要斥责孩子们，

219
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.642
and say, sit down and come here  and do that, and so forth.
告诉他们坐下，过来，做那个，等等。

220
00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:02.957
We said, let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle,
我们决定让孩子们做一件 我们称之为周期的事，

221
00:11:02.957 --> 00:11:04.222
which meets once a week.
也就是每周会面一次。

222
00:11:04.222 --> 00:11:06.532
And we'd say, you put the rules together
我们对他们说，你们自己制定规则，

223
00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:08.859
and then you decide what you want to do with it.
然后自己来决定你们要怎么做。

224
00:11:08.859 --> 00:11:11.041
So can you all hit yourself on the head?
那么你们能每周想出一个点子吗？

225
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:13.363
Sure, for a week, try.
当然，花一周的时间试试看。

226
00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:17.298
They came up with the very same rules that we had,
他们想到了跟我们制定的 规则一样的规矩，

227
00:11:17.298 --> 00:11:18.689
except they're theirs.
只不过这是他们自己的点子。

228
00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:20.934
And then, they have the power,
然后他们就有权力了，

229
00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:25.926
which means, they can and do suspend and expel kids
也就是说他们能够让孩子们 停课甚至把他们开除，

230
00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:31.324
so that we're not playing school, they really decide.
这样一来就不是我们在运营学校， 他们才是真正做决定的人。

231
00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:34.367
And then, in this same vein,
然后，用同样的方式，

232
00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:36.761
we keep a digital mosaic,
我们保留了一个数码马赛克，

233
00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:40.392
because this is not constructivist or Montessori or something.
因为这不是构成论法或者蒙特梭利 （意大利女医师及教育家）之类的教育法。

234
00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:43.930
It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum
我们的做法能够以600块马赛克的形式

235
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.598
with 600 tiles of a mosaic,
保留巴西的教育课程，

236
00:11:46.598 --> 00:11:49.735
which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're 17.
希望这些孩子在17岁前都能够接触到。

237
00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:52.570
And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing
我们一直在追踪他们的进度， 我们知道他们表现的如何，

238
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.610
and we say, you're not interested  in this now, let's wait a year.
我们会说，你现在对这个不太感兴趣， 再等一年看看。

239
00:11:56.624 --> 00:12:00.856
And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category,
这些孩子被划分成了很多组， 但是并不以年龄为划分标准，

240
00:12:00.856 --> 00:12:04.582
so the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,
于是6岁的孩子可以跟一个 11岁的孩子上同样的课，

241
00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:06.947
that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups
这就消除了所有的帮派和团体，

242
00:12:06.947 --> 00:12:10.832
and this stuff that we have  in the schools, in general.
通常这些现象在普通的学校都很常见。

243
00:12:10.832 --> 00:12:13.273
And they have a zero  to 100 percent grading,
我们有0到100%的评分制度，

244
00:12:13.273 --> 00:12:17.074
which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours.
每隔几个小时他们自己就用 应用软件给自己打分。

245
00:12:17.074 --> 00:12:21.509
Until we know they're 37 percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue,
直到我们认为他们已经掌握了 我们所要求的37%左右的技能，

246
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:26.404
so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it.
我们就会把他们推到社会上去， 因为他们已经掌握了足够的知识技能。

247
00:12:26.404 --> 00:12:31.647
And so the courses are World Cup Soccer, or building a bicycle.
我们提供的的课程就是看世界杯足球赛， 或者拼装一辆自行车。

248
00:12:31.647 --> 00:12:35.918
And people will sign up for  a 45-day course on building a bicycle.
学生们一般都会注册一个 45天的自行车组装课。

249
00:12:35.918 --> 00:12:40.487
Now, try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is 3.1416.
尝试在不知道pi的值是3.1416的 情况下组装一辆自行车。

250
00:12:40.487 --> 00:12:42.251
You can't.
你们做不到吧。

251
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:46.763
And try, any one of you,  using 3.1416 for something.
你们都试一下用3.1416做点什么。

252
00:12:46.903 --> 00:12:48.409
You don't know anymore.
你们应该都想不出来了。

253
00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:50.840
So this is lost and that's what  we try to do there,
也就是说这种能力已经丧失了， 这也正是我们在学校里教的，

254
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.954
which is looking  for wisdom in that school.
也就说在我们的学校里寻找智慧。

255
00:12:52.954 --> 00:12:58.514
And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life.
这就把我们带回了这幅蓝图， 以及我们生活的这种分布状态。

256
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.571
I accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it.
当我想到这个问题，我募集了很多钱。

257
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:05.818
When you think and you say, now is the time to give back --
你们仔细想想之后就会说， 现在是时候回馈社会了——

258
00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:08.490
well, if you're giving back,  you took too much.
不过，如果你想要回馈， 那就说明你已经拿的太多了。

259
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:15.542
(Laughter) (Applause)
（笑声）（掌声）

260
00:13:16.642 --> 00:13:19.222
I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day
我总是会想到沃伦·巴菲特 （美国投资家，“股神”）某天醒来，

261
00:13:19.222 --> 00:13:22.606
and finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had.
发现他拥有的资产比之前 想象的还要多300亿美元。

262
00:13:22.606 --> 00:13:25.398
And he looks and he says, what am I going to do with this?
他看着这个数字说道， 我要拿这些钱干点什么呢？

263
00:13:25.398 --> 00:13:28.235
And he says, I'll give it to someone who really needs this.
他说，我得把它给真正需要的人。

264
00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:30.523
I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)
我要把它给比尔·盖茨。 （笑声）

265
00:13:31.906 --> 00:13:35.056
And my guy, who's my financial advisor in New York,
我在纽约的财务顾问，

266
00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:36.949
he says, look, you're a silly guy
他说，看，你太傻了，

267
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:40.222
because you would have 4.1 times  more money today
如果你用钱生钱， 而不是把它们捐出去，

268
00:13:40.222 --> 00:13:44.482
if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go.
你现在就会拥有相当于 之前4.1倍的资产了。

269
00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:46.300
But I like sharing as you go better.
不过我还是更喜欢把它们捐出去。

270
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.606
(Applause)

I taught MBAs at MIT for a time
我以前在麻省理工给MBA学生们上过课，

and I ended up, one day, at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.
有一天我路过 Mount Auburn公墓。

It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.

我在公墓里走来走去。 那天是我的生日，我在思考。

And I did another stroll around,

and the second time, another question came to me,

And that, I think,  took me different places.
我觉得是这种想法把 我带去了不同的地方。

we had a big pit with fire,

And that did two things.

290
00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:47.183
One, it freed our five kids from following in our steps, our shadow --

291
00:14:47.183 --> 00:14:48.839
They don't know what I do.
他们不会知道我做了什么。

292
00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:50.063

And I'm not going to take them somewhere

The five kids know nothing, which is good.

I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever.

No, we've been to the beaches,

306
00:15:21.913 --> 00:15:24.475
so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique,

307

I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.

I've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled.

So, we've been busy.

314
00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:51.521
(Laughter)
（笑声）

315
00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:55.078
And with this rationale, I look at these days and I think,
带着这种逻辑， 我回顾这些日子，我就想，

I'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all.

And so I'm writing a new book.

We started three new companies in the last two years.

319
00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:08.754
I'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world,
我现在正在努力让这种教育系统 面向全世界免费开放，

320
00:16:08.754 --> 00:16:12.183
and I've found, very interestingly enough, that nobody wants it for free.
我还发现一个非常有趣的现象， 没有人希望免费的接受这种教育。

321
00:16:12.207 --> 00:16:14.145
And so I've been trying for 10 years

322
00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:17.360
to get the public system to take over this school rationale,
想让公共系统接受这种教育理念，

323
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.965
much as the public schools we have,

324
00:16:19.965 --> 00:16:24.662
which has instead of 43 out of 100, as their rating, as their grades,
不再使用43/100的评分制度，

325
00:16:24.662 --> 00:16:27.351
has 91 out of 100.

326
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.784
But for free, nobody wants it.
但是如果免费，没有人想要。

327
00:16:29.784 --> 00:16:32.978
So maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere.
所以可能我们要开始收点钱， 慢慢的人们就会接受它。

328
00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:36.759
But getting this out is one of the things we want to do.
但是让这个办法奏效是我们的目的之一。

329
00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:40.076
And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you,
我觉得这就给我们所有人 留下了一个信息，

330
00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:41.828
I think is a little bit like this:

332

how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon.
如何在周一下午去看电影。

335
00:16:52.242 --> 00:16:56.343
And if we're looking for wisdom, we need to learn to do that as well.
如果我们在寻找智慧， 我们就也需要知道如何做到这一点。

336
00:16:56.343 --> 00:16:59.993
And so, what we've done all of these years is very simple,
所以我们这些年做的事情其实很简单，

337
00:16:59.993 --> 00:17:03.165
is use the little tool, which is ask three whys in a row.
比如利用一些小技巧， 也就是同时问三个为什么。

338
00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:05.926
Because the first why you always have a good answer for.

339

到了第三个问题， 你根本不知道为何你要做现在正在做的事。

341
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:18.508
What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this,
我想让这种想法在你们的头脑中扎根， 可能如果你们这么做了，

342
00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:21.264
you will come to the question, what for?

What am I doing this for?

And hopefully, as a result of that, and over time,

I hope that with this, and that's what I'm wishing you,

Your ideas are so radical.

356
00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:13.221
probably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them

357

but that's a very personal one.

367
00:18:39.028 --> 00:18:43.240
But the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control.
不过事实是它很快就会成为 带有失控风险的一种信念飞跃。
