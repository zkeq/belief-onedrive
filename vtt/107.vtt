College, shopping, music.

when you're being handed your diploma,

they can even evoke emotions.

But visuals, they're of course more than just graphic icons.
但在视觉方面，它们又 不仅仅是图像符号。

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.556
You know, if I want to tell the story of modern-day struggle,

I would start with the armrest between two airplane seats

Now, commercial flight is full of these images.

They're designed to make you more comfortable --

52
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.916
(Laughter)
（笑声）

53
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.156
except they don't.
但常常事与愿违。

54
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.140
(Laughter)
（笑声）

55
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.460
So I never sleep on airplanes.

What I do occasionally is I fall into a sort of painful coma.

I have the most terrible taste in my mouth.

The thing is, you know, I love sleeping.

And when I sleep, I really prefer to do it while spooning.

65
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.596

the only thing that makes sleeping even more complicated

is when you have small children.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.900
They show up at your bed at around 4am

74
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.076
with some bogus excuse of, "I had a bad dream."
编造一些借口，比如 “我做了一个恶梦。”

(Laughter)

76
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.326
And then, of course you feel sorry for them, they're your kids,

77
00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.766
so you let them into your bed.
就让他们上床吧。

78
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.495
And I have to admit, at the beginning, they're really cute and warm and snugly.
开始时他们表现得很乖， 令你温暖又舒适。

79
00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:06.676
The minute you fall back asleep, they inexplicably --
但当你再睡着的那一刻，不知怎的，

80
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.356
(Laughter)
（笑声）

81
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.636
start rotating.
他们就开始摆出横七竖八的姿势。

82
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.236
(Laughter)
（笑声）

83
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.213
We like to call this the helicopter mode.
我们喜欢称之为直升机模式。

84
00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:16.076
(Laughter)
（笑声）

85
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.116
Now, the deeper something is etched into your consciousness,
另外，有一些更深入的东西 被刻进了你的意识中，

86
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.500
the fewer details we need to have an emotional reaction.
只需要比较少的细节， 就能触动情绪的反应。

87
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.036
(Laughter)
（笑声）

88
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.980
So why does an image like this work?
为什么像这样的图像能引起共鸣呢？

89
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.436
It works, because we as readers
因为我们做为阅读者，

90
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.700
are incredibly good at filling in the blanks.
擅长于填补缺失的部分。

91
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.836
Now, when you draw, there's this concept of negative space.
当你画画时，有一种负空间的概念。

92
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.756
And the idea is, that instead of drawing the actual object,
其核心做法不是绘制实际的物体，

93
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.796
you draw the space around it.
只是画出它周围的空间。

94
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.220
So the bowls in this drawing are empty.
所以图中的碗是空的。

95
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.060
But the black ink prompts your brain to project food into a void.
但黑色的墨水会促使 你将食物投射到空间中。

96
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.180
What we see here is not a owl flying.
这里看到的并不是飞行的猫头鹰。

97
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.076
What we actually see is a pair of AA batteries

98
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.276
standing on a nonsensical drawing,
放在一张荒诞的画上，

99
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.836
and I animate the scene by moving my desk lamp up and down.
我通过上下移动台灯的光线， 让场景动起来了。

100
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.916
(Laughter)
（笑声）

101
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.540
The image really only exists in your mind.
图像只存在于你的脑海中。

102
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.580
So, how much information do we need to trigger such an image?
那么，需要多少信息 才能触发这样的一个图像？

103
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.940
My goal as an artist is to use the smallest amount possible.
艺术家的目标是用尽可能少的信息。

104
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.756
I try to achieve a level of simplicity
我想要达到的极简程度，

105
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.196
where, if you were to take away one more element,
就是只需要拿走一个元素，

106
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.260
the whole concept would just collapse.
整个概念都会崩塌。

107
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.980
And that's why my personal favorite tool as an artist is abstraction.
我作为艺术家， 最喜欢用抽象做工具。

108
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.356
I've come up with this system which I call the abstract-o-meter,
我想出一个称之为抽像仪表的系统，

109
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.716
and this is how it works.
这是它的工作原理。

110
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.636
So you take a symbol, any symbol, for example the heart and the arrow,
你拿其中一个符号， 例如心脏和箭头，

111
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.476
which most of us would read as the symbol for love,
人们都会视之为爱情的象征，

112
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.316
and I'm an artist, so I can draw this
我是艺术家，可以把它画出来，

113
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.300
in any given degree of realism or abstraction.
并以任何现实或抽象的程度来呈现。

114
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.516
Now, if I go too realistic on it, it just grosses everybody out.
如果它过于现实， 就会让所有人难以接受。

115
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.556
(Laughter)
（笑声）

116
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.516
If I go too far on the other side and do very abstract,
如果我做得太抽象，

117
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.796
nobody has any idea what they're looking at.
就没人能看懂了。

118
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.196
So I have to find the perfect place on that scale,
所以我必须找到平衡点，

119
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.260
in this case it's somewhere in the middle.
位于仪表标尺上接近中间的某处。

120
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.660
Now, once we have reduced an image to a more simple form,
一旦将图像变得更简单，

121
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.020
all sorts of new connections become possible.
就会增加各种新联系的可能性，

122
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.356
And that allows for totally new angles in storytelling.
出现不同的，讲故事的新角度。

123
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.756
(Laughter)
（笑声）

124
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.236
And so, what I like to do is,
因此我喜欢做的是，

125
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.460
I like to take images from really remote cultural areas and bring them together.
从很偏远的文化区域拍摄图像， 并将它们整合在一起。

126
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.196
Now, with more daring references --
更大胆的参考资料——

127
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.876
(Laughter)
（笑声）

128
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.620
I can have more fun.
使我可以获得更多的乐趣。

129
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.356
But of course, I know that eventually things become so obscure
但最终事情变得太模糊，

130
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.276
that I start losing some of you.
就会让你们中的一些人失去兴趣。

131
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.916
So as a designer, it's absolutely key to have a good understanding
因此，作为设计师，关键是要 对关于观众视觉和文化的词汇

132
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.260
of the visual and cultural vocabulary of your audience.
有着很好的理解。

133
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.076
With this image here, a comment on the Olympics in Athens,
这张图片评论了雅典奥运会，

134
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.196
I assumed that the reader of the "New Yorker"
我默认《纽约客》的读者

135
00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:07.860
would have some rudimentary idea of Greek art.
对希腊艺术有些基本的了解。

136
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.020
If you don't, the image doesn't work.
否则，图像就不起作用了。

137
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.436
But if you do, you might even appreciate the small detail,
如果你有一定的理解， 甚至会欣赏那些细节，

138
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.316
like the beer-can pattern here on the bottom of the vase.
就像花瓶底部的啤酒罐图案。

139
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.020
(Laughter)
（笑声）

140
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.556
A recurring discussion I have with magazine editors,
我与杂志编辑们一起反复讨论过——

141
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.556
who are usually word people,
他们是文字方面的行家——

142
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.180
is that their audience, you,
他们的观众，也就是在座的各位，

143
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.716
are much better at making radical leaps with images
能够赋予图像比其原本所要表现的意图

144
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.460
than they're being given credit for.
更加跳跃式的含义。

145
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.356
And the only thing I find frustrating is that they often seem to push me
而唯一让我感到沮丧的 一件事是，他们经常

146

towards a small set of really tired visual clichés

You know, it's the businessman climbing up a ladder,

If there are editorial decision makers here in the audience,

When is a visual cliché good or bad?

when the situation at the power plant in Fukushima got out of hand.

just walking through the site,

contained in a sharp image."

A while later, I'm back in New York,

And only later I realized,

that is neither efficient nor scalable, I think.

I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.

which I call Sunday sketching,
我称这个过程为周日草图，

218

that had nothing to do with the original purpose of that item.

And the only trick that eventually works is if I open my mind

and run through every image I have stored up there,

and see if something clicks.

And if it does, just add a few lines of ink to connect --

226

to preserve this very short moment of inspiration.

was that the real magic doesn't happen on paper.
