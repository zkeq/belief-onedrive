2
00:00:14.403 --> 00:00:17.713
a book sat on the coffee table in our living room,
我家客厅的咖啡桌上有一本书，

3
00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:19.754
just steps from our front door.
离我家前门只有几步的距离。

4
00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:22.296

Ours had white carpet

and a curio of my mother's most treasured collectibles.

7
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:33.254
That room represented the sacrifices of generations gone by

8
00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:36.254
who, by poverty or by policy,
囿于贫穷或政策，

9
00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:38.796
couldn't afford a curio of collectibles
我的祖先们买不起一件古董，

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.088
let alone a middle class house to put them in.
更不必说一间能放 古董的中产阶级房产。

11
00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:44.796
That room had to stay perfect.
因此那个房间必须保持完美。

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.588
But I would risk messing up that perfect room every day

13
00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:51.504
just to see that book.
只为了看那本书。

14
00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:55.004
On the cover sat a woman named Septima Clark.
书封面上是一个名为 赛普蒂玛·克拉克的女性。

platted down the sides of her head,

and pride and wisdom just emanated from her dark skin.

Septima Clark was an activist and an educator,

a woman after whom I'd eventually model my own career.

21
00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:19.088
But more than all the words she ever spoke,

22
00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:22.129
that single portrait of Septima Clark,
当时她的那张照片，

23
00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:24.629
it defined confidence for me
在我认字之前，

24
00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:27.379
before I ever even knew the word.
就教会了我什么叫作自信。

25
00:01:27.403 --> 00:01:28.713
It may sound simple,
这听起来可能很简单，

26
00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:33.588
but confidence is something that we underestimate the importance of.
但我们常常低估自信的重要性。

27
00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:37.088
We treat it like a nice-to-have instead of a must-have.
我们把自信当作锦上添花， 而非必要之物。

28
00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:40.588
We place value on knowledge and resources

above what we deem to be the soft skill of confidence.

and more resources now than at any other point in history,

and still injustice abounds and challenges persist.

If knowledge and resources were all that we needed,

we wouldn't still be here.

35
00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:04.421
And I believe that confidence is one of the main things

36
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:06.112
missing from the equation.

I'm completely obsessed with confidence.

between trying and doing until it's done.

The name of the book on that coffee table was "I Dream A World,"

when I was a teacher,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.254
like a Willy Wonka world of pure imagination,

51
00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.528

All of my students were black or brown.

this world invites to be confident.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:21.129
That's why it was so important that my classroom be a place

58
00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:24.546
where my students could build the muscle of confidence,

61
00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:37.171
After all, what are academic skills without the confidence to use those skills
毕竟，如果没有信心改变世界的话，

62
00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:39.153
to go out and change the world.
要学术技能又有什么用呢？

63
00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:43.879
Now is when I should tell you about two of my students, Jamal and Regina.
现在，我要向你们介绍我的 两个学生：贾迈勒和蕾吉娜。

Jamal was brilliant, but unfocused.
贾迈勒头脑灵活，但注意力不集中。

66
00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:53.963
He would squirm in his chair during independent work,
做独立作业的时候， 他会在椅子上扭来扭曲，

67
00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:58.004
and he would never stay still for more than three or four minutes.
从来没能保持不动 3或4分钟以上的。

68
00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:00.671
Students like Jamal can perplex brand new teachers
像贾迈勒一类的学生 会让新老师非常困惑，

because they're not quite sure how to support young people like him.

If he could give me focused work,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.254
then he could do it from anywhere in the classroom,

74
00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:16.879
from our classroom rug, from behind my desk,
比如说在教室地毯上， 或是我的书桌后面，

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:20.945
from inside his classroom locker, which turned out to be his favorite place.

76

Jamal's least favorite subject was writing,

78
00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:30.837

84
00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:47.088
The heavy favorites were obvious,
大多数人选择的候选人都一样，

85
00:04:47.112 --> 00:04:50.171

Regina was equally as brilliant, but active.

99
00:05:33.278 --> 00:05:35.838
She'd inevitably finish her work early,
她每天都早早做完作业，

100
00:05:35.862 --> 00:05:39.629
and then she'd get on about the business of distracting other students.

101
00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:40.963
(Laughter)

passing those notes that teachers hate but kids love.

Despite my high ideals for our classroom,

I would too often default to my baser instincts,

and I would choose compliance over confidence.

Regina was a glitch in my intended system.

that she was being a distraction.

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:24.820
My approach communicated to Regina that she herself was a distraction.

118
00:06:25.862 --> 00:06:28.088
I watched the light go out from her eyes,

The entire class became irritable,

and we didn't recover for the rest of the day.

123
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.504
I think about the day often,

124
00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:47.046

126
00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:56.754
I know that I could have started the process of killing her confidence
我知道我可能在逐渐扼杀

127
00:06:55.418 --> 00:06:58.028
forever.

crushing us between a flurry of can'ts, won'ts and impossibles.

131

and when we get stuck, we can't even get started.
当我们陷入僵局时， 我们甚至无法迈出第一步。

133
00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:18.463
Instead of getting mired in what can get in our way,
自信能让我们果断决策，

134
00:07:18.487 --> 00:07:22.504
confidence invites us to perform with certainty.

135
00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:25.588
We all operate a little differently when we're sure we can win
当我们相信自己能成功，而不仅仅是希望，

136
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.338
versus if we just hope we will.

137
00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:30.338
Now, this can be a helpful check.
这是一个很有帮助的检查。

138
00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:32.129
If you don't have enough confidence,

00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:34.879
it could be because you need to readjust your goal.

If you have too much confidence,
