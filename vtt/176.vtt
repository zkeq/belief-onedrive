00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:15.392
The creative process -- you know this --
众所周知，创意过程

2
00:00:14.992 --> 00:00:17.441
from the first idea to the final product,
从第一个想法冒出来到最终产品

3
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.444
is a long process.
是一个很长的过程。

4
00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:22.207
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement,
需要超级多的 反复迭代，无数的改进，

5
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.304
blood, sweat, tears and years.
血汗，泪水和时间。

6
00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.887
And we're not saying you're going to go out for a walk
我们讨论的并不是，你出去散个步，

7
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.602
and come back with the Sistine Chapel in your left hand.
左手就可以带着 西斯廷教堂（的设计）回来。

8
00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.314
So what frame of the creative process did we focus on?
那么我们关注的是 创意过程的哪个环节？

9
00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.768
Just this first part.
就是这第一部分。

10
00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:36.397
Just brainstorming, coming up with a new idea.
去做头脑风暴，产生新点子。

11
00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:41.804
We actually ran four studies with a variety of people.
我们针对一些不同的人做过四项研究，

12
00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:44.246
You were either walking indoors or outdoors.
包括了进行户外和室内散步的群体。

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.858
And all of these studies found the same conclusion.
所有的这些研究都得出了相同的结论。

14
00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:50.536
I'm only going to tell you about one of them today.
我今天只打算告诉你们其中一个例子。

15
00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:55.141
One of the tests we used for creativity was alternate uses.
我们做创意研究的其中 一个测试是替代使用。

16
00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:56.900
In this test, you have four minutes.
在这个测试中，你有4分钟的时间

17
00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.801
Your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects
要想出尽可能多的方法 去使用生活中你所能想到的

18
00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.036
as you can think of.
日常事物。

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.972
So, for example, what else would you do with a key,
比如，除了开门外，

20
00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:07.413
other than to use it for opening up a lock?
你还能用钥匙做什么？

21
00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:12.046
Clearly, you could use it as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?
显然，你还可以它来当作长颈鹿的 第三只眼睛，没错吧？

22
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.147
Maybe. That's sort of interesting, kind of new. But is it creative?
或许如此。但诸如此类好玩的 新使用方法，算是创意吗？

23
00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.272
So people came up with as many ideas as they could,
虽然人们想出了各种各样的主意，

24
00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:21.461
and we had to decide:
而我们需要判断，

25
00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:23.085
Is this creative or not?
这是不是创意？

26
00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:27.543
The definition of creativity that a lot of people go with
很多人对创意的定义是

27
00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.212
is "appropriate novelty."
“适用的新奇”。

28
00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.307
For something to be appropriate, it has to be realistic,
要让事情变得适用，就需要实用。

29
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:36.196
so unfortunately, you can't use a key as an eyeball.
但不幸的是， 你无法将钥匙当眼球使用。

30
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.388
Boo!
这不算数。

31
00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:42.259
But "novel," the second thing, is that nobody had to have said it.
而第二点，新奇， 是指之前没有人提到过。

32
00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:45.187
So for us, it had to be appropriate first,
所以对我们而言，这首先得适用，

33
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.754
and then for novelty,
然后是新奇，

34
00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:50.563
nobody else in the entire population that we surveyed could have said it.
已知的地球人都没有想到这个。

35
00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:54.286
So you might think you could use a key to scratch somebody's car,
所以如果你说可以 用钥匙来刮花别人的车，

36
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.225
but if somebody else said that, you didn't get credit for it.
但如果已经有人说过了， 就不够新奇了。

37
00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:58.294
Neither of you did.
你们都不算。

38
00:01:58.448 --> 00:02:01.427
However, only one person said this:
然而，只有其中一个人这样说:

39
00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:05.294
"If you were dying and it were a murder mystery,
“假如你快要死去，而且是被谋杀的，

40
00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:08.312
and you had to carve the name of the murderer into the ground
你就可以（用钥匙） 把遗嘱和凶手的名字一起

41
00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:09.977
with your dying words."
刻在地上。”

42
00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:11.630
One person said this.
有个人就是这样说。

43
00:02:11.654 --> 00:02:12.755
(Laughter)
（笑声）

44
00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.064
And it's a creative idea, because it's appropriate and it's novel.
所以这是一个创造性的想法， 因为适用，而且新奇。

45
00:02:15.904 --> 00:02:19.522
You either did this test and came up with ideas while you were seated
你参与这个测试的 时候是可以是坐着的，

46
00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:22.068
or while you were walking on a treadmill.
也可以是在跑步机上走步。

47
00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:23.360
(Laughter)
（笑声）

48
00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:26.780
They did the test twice, with different objects.
他们做了这个测试两次， 每次都针对不同的人群。

49
00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:29.867
Three groups: the first group sat first

50
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:32.734
and then sat again for the second test.

51
00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:35.316
The second group sat first
第二组，第一次先坐着，

52
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.683
and then did the second test while walking on a treadmill.
第二次则在跑步机上走着。

53
00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:40.856
The third group -- and this is interesting --
第三组，就比较有意思了，

54
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.828
they walked on the treadmill first, and then they sat.
他们第一次先在跑步机上走， 然后再坐下回答问题。

55
00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:48.340
OK, so the two groups that sat together for the first test,
那么两个先坐着测试的小组，

56
00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.425
they looked pretty similar to each other,
他们的想法彼此差异不大，

57
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.398
and they averaged about 20 creative ideas per person.

58
00:02:53.977 --> 00:02:56.394
The group that was walking on the treadmill
那个在跑步机上行走的小组

59
00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:58.231
did almost twice as well.
几乎想出了两倍的创意。

60
00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:02.239
And they were just walking on a treadmill in a windowless room.
而他们做的无非是在没有窗户的室内， 在跑步机上散步了一会儿。

61
00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.608
Remember, they took the test twice.
记住，他们每组人测试了两次。

62
00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:10.326
The people who sat twice for that second test didn't get any better;
两次都坐着的受试者， 第二次的成绩并没有变好，

63
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.558
practice didn't help.
练习并无帮助。

64
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.468
But these same people who were sitting and then went on the treadmill
但先坐着，然后在跑步机上行走的人，

65
00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:17.121
got a boost from walking.
成绩出现了飙升。

66
00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.672
Here's the interesting thing.

The people who were walking on the treadmill
在跑步机上行走的人

68
00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.228
still had a residue effect of the walking,
表现出了散步的残余效应，

69
00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:26.158
and they were still creative afterwards.
后期仍然富有创意。

70
00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:29.307
So the implication of this is that you should go for a walk
这个研究的启发就是， 在你的一个重要会议开始前，

71
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:34.183
before your next big meeting and just start brainstorming right away.
你应该出去散个步， 然后立马开始头脑风暴。

72
00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:36.005
We have five tips for you

73

that will help make this the best effect possible.

when you're in the shower and all of a sudden,

a new idea pops out of the shampoo bottle.
新的主意就从满头的 泡沫中冒出来了。

78
00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.591
This is something you're thinking about ahead of time.

79
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:55.728
They're intentionally thinking about brainstorming a different perspective

80
00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:57.358
on the walk.
进行头脑风暴。

81
00:03:58.312 --> 00:04:00.178
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot:
第二——我常常被人问，

82
00:04:00.202 --> 00:04:02.173
Is this OK while running?
跑步的时候也行吗？

83
00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:05.015
Well, the answer for me is that if I were running,
好吧，对我来讲，我跑步的时候

84
00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:09.319
the only new idea I would have would be to stop running, so ...
唯一想到的新主意就是停下来······

85
00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.681
(Laughter)
（笑声）

86
00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.826
But if running for you is a comfortable pace, good.
但假如跑步对你 是一种非常舒适的运动，那没问题。

87
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.408
It turns out, whatever physical activity is not taking a lot of attention.
不论是哪种体力活动， 只要不分担太多注意力就行。

88
00:04:18.432 --> 00:04:21.231
So just walking at a comfortable pace is a good choice.
所以在舒适的地方散步 是蛮好的选择。

89
00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:25.162
Also, you want to come up with as many ideas as you can.
另外，去想出尽可能多的主意。

90
00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:28.634
One key of creativity is to not lock on that first idea.
创意的一个关键是 不要纠结在第一个主意上。

91
00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:29.909
Keep going.
继续前进。

92
00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:33.669
Keep coming up with new ones, until you pick one or two to pursue.
继续想新的主意， 直至你选择出1-2个来深入思考。

93
00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:37.924
You might worry that you don't want to write them down,
你可能会担心如果不把它写下来

94
00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:39.783
because what if you forget them?
回头忘记了怎么办？

95
00:04:39.807 --> 00:04:41.692
So the idea here is to speak them.
最好的方法是把它说出来。

96
00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.668
Everybody was speaking their new ideas.
每个人都说出他们的新主意。

97
00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:47.432
So you can put your headphones on and record through your phone
你可以带上耳机，用手机录下来，

98
00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:50.719
and then just pretend you're having a creative conversation, right?
就假想自己在进行一场 有创意的对话，没错吧？

99
00:04:50.743 --> 00:04:53.805
Because the act of writing your idea down is already a filter.
因为把主意写下来的动作 就是一种过滤。

100
00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:56.773
You're going to be like, "Is this good enough to write down?"
你不由得会想： “这真的值得写下来吗？”

101
00:04:55.647 --> 00:04:56.674
And then you write it down.
然后才会动笔。

102
00:04:56.674 --> 00:05:00.872
So just speak as many as you can, record them and think about them later.
所以尽可能多的去说出来，录下来， 事后再花时间认真思考。

103
00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:04.224
And finally: don't do this forever. Right?
最后，不要一直这么做。

104
00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:07.084
If you're on the walk and that idea's not coming to you,
如果散步并不能给你带来好主意，

105
00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:09.124
come back to it later at another time.
稍后再来一次。

106
00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.661
I think we're coming up on a break right now,
我想现在我们就需要稍作休息了，

107
00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:14.126
so I have an idea:
我有个主意：

108
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.860
Why don't you grab a leash
何不带上你的宠物，

109
00:05:15.884 --> 00:05:18.095
and take your thoughts for a walk?
带着你的想法出去溜达一圈？

110
00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:20.757
Thank you.
谢谢。

111
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:23.461
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
