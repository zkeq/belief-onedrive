thinking about little girls,

whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,

And where are all the female superheroes?

52
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.036
And that is not actually the question,
这么问并不确切，

53
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.890
because there's plenty of female superheroes.

Where are the costumes? Where are the toys?

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.316

但是我们生活在一个媒体无处不在的社会中。

69
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.236
What that means is that every single aspect of your human existence outside of your basic bodily functions

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.716
is in some way touched by media.

all of that is in some way mediated.

So the answer in our society

is largely through media.

79
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.836

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.636
in that our society,

media don't simply exist as information distribution technologies and devices.

They also exist as corporate entities.

How big of a problem?

86
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.556
Well think about this:

in 1983, 90 percent of American media were owned by 50 companies.
在1983年，五十家公司掌控着全美国百分之九十的媒体。

It's a lot of different worldviews.

In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,

91
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.635

They are NBCUniversal Comcast, AOL Time Warner,

the Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation.

97
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.476

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.196
if six companies control 90 percent of American media,
如果六家公司控制着全美国百分之九十的媒体，

how much influence do you think they have over what you're allowed to see every day?
你们认为，在观看什么节目的问题上，它们对你们产生了多大的影响？

100
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.076
Because in media studies,
因为在媒体学的研究中，

101
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.356
we spend a lot of time saying that media can't tell us what to think,
我们花费大量的时间说明媒体并不能告诉我们去想什么，

102
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.636
and they can't; they're terrible at that.
它们确实不能，而且做得很糟糕。

103
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.036
But that's not their job.

Media don't tell us what to think.

They control the conversation,

107
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.436
and in controlling the conversation,
即使是现在，

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.476
they don't have to get you to think what they want you to think.
它们不必让你想到 它们想要让你想的东西，

They'll just get you thinking about the things they want you to think about,
它们仅仅是让你思考他们想要让你思考的事情，

112
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.596
How does this work in practice?

113
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.596
Let's just take one of those companies.

We'll do an easy one.

Let's talk about the Walt Disney Company for a second.

116
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.640
The reason why I always pick the Walt Disney Company is this.
我总是选择迪士尼公司的原因是，

117
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.720
Is there a single person in this room who has never seen a Disney movie?

118
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.660
Look around. Exactly.

119
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.196
I picked Disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration

120
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.436
in our society.
渗透进了我们的社会。

121
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.836
Every single person has been exposed to Disney,
每一个人都曾经接触迪士尼，

122
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.836
so it's an easy one for me to use.
所以我用它来举例效果最好。

123
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.116
Since 1937, Disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls.
从1937年开始，迪士尼就通过向女孩儿们出售公主玩偶赚钱。

124
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.236
It's made a huge chunk of its money.
他们为此大赚了一笔。

125
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.236
Unless, of course, the princess your daughter is interested in,

126
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.740
as my daughter is, is this one.
喜欢这样的角色。

127
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.996
See, in 2012,

Disney purchased LucasFilm for the sum of four billion dollars,

之后汉索罗，欧比旺・肯诺比，达斯·维德，

卢克·天行者和尤达（星球大战人物），就迅速占据了迪斯尼商店。

and not Princess Leia.
但却没有莱娅公主（同为星球大战人物）。

132
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.045
Why? 
为什么？

133
00:06:28.046 --> 00:06:32.956
Because this princess messes up the public pedagogy for these princesses.
因为这名公主会扰乱我们对这些公主的公共认知。

134
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.516
So Disney did not put Princess Leia merchandise in the store,
所以迪斯尼并没有把莱娅公主商品化。

135
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.476
and when people went to Disney and said,
当人们跑到迪斯尼并询问，

136
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.810
"Hey, where's all the Princess Leia stuff?"
“嘿，莱娅公主的商品在哪儿呢？”

137
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.810
Disney said, "We have no intention
迪斯尼回答：“我们并不打算

138
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.030
of putting Princess Leia merchandise in the store."
提供莱娅公主的周边商品。”

139
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.756
And fans were angry and they took to Twitter
所以粉丝们很生气，他们在Twitter上

140
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.810
with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.
发起了标签，＃我们想要莱娅。

141
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.316
And Disney said, "Wait, that's not what we meant.
然后迪斯尼回复，“等一下，那不是我们的本意。

142
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.996
What we meant was,
我们的意思是，

143
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.700
we don't have any Princess Leia merchandise yet, but we will."
我们目前还没有莱娅公主的相关商品，但我们会有的。”

144
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.116
And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,
那是在2012年的事了，到了2015年，

145
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.671
and if you go to the Disney Store, as I recently have,
如果你像我一样，最近去过迪斯尼商店，

146
00:07:02.696 --> 00:07:04.560
and look for Princess Leia merchandise,
寻找莱娅公主的相关商品，

147
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.014
do you know how many Princess Leia items there are in the Disney Store?
你猜商店里有多少关于她的商品？

148
00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:11.524
Zero, because Disney has no intention of putting Princess Leia in the store.
一件都没有，因为迪斯尼从来就不打算把莱娅公主放进商店。

149
00:07:11.548 --> 00:07:12.968
And we shouldn't be surprised 
我们不应该为此感到奇怪， 

150
00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:21.876
because we found out that was their policy when they bought Marvel in 2009 for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.
因为那其实是他们在2009年，总共花了45亿美金收购漫威的时候就定好的政策。

151
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.316
Because when you make a lot of money selling princesses to girls,
因为之前通过向女孩们顷售公主玩偶赚了一大笔，

152
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.716
you also kind of want to make money from boys.
他们也想从男孩儿那挣点钱。

153
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.196
And so what better to sell boys than superheroes?
有什么比超级英雄更适合男孩们的吗？

154
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.196
So now Disney had access to Captain America and to Thor,
所以迪斯尼就有了美国队长，雷神，

155
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.556
The Incredible Hulk,
绿巨人，

156
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.356
and they had access even
他们甚至还拥有了一批

157
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.116
to a group of superheroes no one had ever even heard of.
我们没人听说过的超级英雄。

158
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.276
That's how good Marvel was at selling superheroes.
这体现了漫威是出色的英雄卖家。

159
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.716
Last year, they released a film called "Guardians of the Galaxy."
去年，他们发售了一部名叫《银河守护者》的影片。

160
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.636
It's a film that absolutely should not work.
这是一部绝不可能火的影片，

161
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.740
Nobody knew who they were except for comic book nerds like me.
因为除了像我这样的漫画书呆子，一般都没人听说过这些英雄。

162
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.796
One of the characters is a talking tree.
其中一个形象，是一棵会说话的树。

163
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.276
One of the characters is an anthropomorphic raccoon.
另一个形象则是一个拟人化的浣熊。

164
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.756
It should not work.
这怎么想也火不了啊。

165
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.956
And they made a killing off of "Guardians of the Galaxy."
但他们真的就拿着《银河守护者》大赚了一笔。

166
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.516
This character here in the middle, her name is Gamora.
这个中间的形象，她的名字是加美拉。

167
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.396
She's played by Zoe Saldana,
她是由佐伊·索尔达娜扮演的，

168
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.076
and she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja,
她是一个坚强，聪颖，敏捷，打斗起来和忍者一样的形象，

169
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.236
and she is played by a beautiful black woman,
由一位美丽的黑人女性扮演，

170
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.436
and my daughter fell in love with her.
我的女儿爱上了这个形象。

171
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.676
So like any good nerd dad, I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,
所以，我就像一般的好爸爸那样，去给女儿买加美拉的周边商品。

172
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.796
and when I got to the store, I learned a very interesting thing.
当我到了商店，我得知了一件十分有趣的事情。

173
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.556
If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,
如果我想给她买一个加美拉书包，

174
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.460
well, Gamora's not on it.
上面是没有加美拉的。

175
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.876
They probably should have marketed this as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
也许他们在打标牌的时候，应该标成《银河守护者》中的“某些人”。

176
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.956
(Laughter)
（笑声）

177
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.956
And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox, she wasn't on it,
如果我想给她买个午饭袋，

178
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.356
and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt, she wasn't on it.
加美拉也不在上面。T恤也是一样的。

179
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.276
And as a matter of fact,
事实上，

180
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.516
if I went to the store, as I did,
如果我去商店，我确实去看过了，

181
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.036
and looked at the display,
会看到在展品区，

182
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.810
you would find a small picture of Gamora right here,
有一个加美拉的小照片在这儿。

183
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.636
but if you look at any of the actual merchandise on that shelf,
但当你仔细看架子上的商品实物时，

184
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.236
Gamora is not on any of it.
你会发现加美拉没有出现在任何商品上。

185
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.916
Now, I could have taken to Twitter with the hashtag #WheresGamora,
现在，我可以在Twitter上发＃加美拉去哪儿了，

186
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.116
like millions of fans did across the world,
就像世界各地成千上万的粉丝们一样。

187
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.236
but the truth was I wasn't even really that surprised,
但事实上，我并不对此感到惊讶，

188
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.196
because I was there when Disney had released "The Avengers."
因为当迪斯尼播出《复仇者联盟》的时候我也经历过了。

189
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.556
And just this year, we got a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron,"
就在今年，我们又迎来了复联的新续集《奥创纪元》，

190
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.796
and we were very excited,
然后我们很激动，

191
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.316
because there was not one but two female superheroes,

192
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.316
Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.

194
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.876
But here's the real thing about this.
但真相是这样的。

195
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.676
Even though Scarlett Johansson,

196
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.156
who is one of the most popular actresses in America, plays Black Widow,
美国当红女星扮演的黑寡妇；

197
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.516
and Black Widow is the star
即使黑寡妇形象存在于

198
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.516
of not one, not two, but five different Marvel movies,
不是一部两部，而是五部不同的漫威电影，

199
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.156
there is not a single piece of Black Widow merchandise available.
市场上也还是找不到任何关于黑寡妇的产品。

Not one.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.836

who isn't even really in the movie that long.

Who you will not find is Black Widow.

207
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.396
And I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag, as many people did,

I'm tired of having to do that.

it was Black Widow that did it.

221
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.436
I mean, over the next five years,

they will be members of teams.

about other people and about the world we learn through media,

233
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.356

it doesn't matter.

She will either be ignored like Gamora

And it's not fair.

I'm raising a little girl, and she has a little tomboy in her,
我正在养育一个小女孩儿，她的个性有点儿像假小子，

243
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.596
which by the way is a terrible thing to call a girl.
虽然听上去对一个女孩有点像贬义词，

244
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.836
What that basically is saying is, those traits that define you,

they're not really yours,

Zero. None.

249
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.516
People will think it's cute.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.156
They'll call her feisty, because in our society,

adding so-called male traits to girls

252
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.796
is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.

I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.
