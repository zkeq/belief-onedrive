As a sleep scientist,
作为一名睡眠专家，

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.876
this is the question that has captivated me
在过去的10年里，

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.460
for the past 10 years.
我一直在研究这个问题。

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.756
Because while the lightbulb and technology have brought about a world

6
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.236
of 24-hour work and productivity,

7
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.916
it has come at the cost
我们付出的代价

8
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.236
of our naturally occurring circadian rhythm
是违背自然的昼夜节律，

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.460
and our body's need for sleep.
和我们身体对睡眠的需求。

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.276
The circadian rhythm dictates our energy level throughout the day,
昼夜节律决定了 我们一天的能量水平，

11
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:49.156
and only recently we've been conducting a global experiment on this rhythm,
直到最近，我们才开始 就这一节律问题开展全球实验，

12
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.236
which is putting our sleep health
讲究其如何对我们的睡眠健康，

13
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.660
and ultimately our life quality in jeopardy.
甚至生活质量产生危害。

14
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.316
Because of this,
正是因为如此，

15
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.476
we aren't getting the sleep we need,
我们总是睡得不够，

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.236
with the average American sleeping a whole hour less

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.356
we decided to wear it as a badge of honor
我们以睡眠不足为荣，

20
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.580
that we can get by on not enough sleep.
将其视为一块 可以佩戴的荣誉勋章。

21
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.940
This all adds up to a real health crisis.
这其实都为各类 健康隐患埋下了伏笔、

22
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:20.356
Most of us know that poor sleep is linked to diseases
众所周知，睡眠不足 与疾病高度相关，

23
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.116
like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease,
譬如老年痴呆，心血管疾病，

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.180
stroke and diabetes.
中风，糖尿病。

25
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.516
And if you go untreated with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea,
如果不对睡眠紊乱 （如睡眠窒息）加以治疗，

26
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.300
you're more likely to get many of these illnesses.
你将更容易患上这些疾病。

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.300
But did you know about sleep's impact on your mental states?

28
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.556
Poor sleep makes us make risky, rash decisions

29
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.540
and is a drain on our capacity for empathy.
我们体谅他人的能力也会下降。

30
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.956
When sleep deprivation literally makes us more sensitive to our own pain,
缺乏睡眠会使我们 对自己的痛苦更加敏感，

31
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.996
it's not so surprising that we have a hard time relating to others
难怪当我们睡得不够的时候，

32
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.236
and just generally being a good and healthy person
会难以作为一个健康的正常人

33
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.990
when we're sleep-deprived.
同他人相处。

34
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.116
Scientists are now starting to understand

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.996
My research focuses
我的研究重点放在

38
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.970
on what many scientists believe is the most regenerative stage of sleep:
被许多科学家视为 最有再生力的睡眠阶段：

39
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.740
deep sleep.
深度睡眠期。

40
00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.076
We now know that generally speaking,

41
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.716
there are three stages of sleep:
睡眠有三个阶段：

42
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.076
light sleep,
浅睡期，

43
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.116
rapid eye movement or REM
快速动眼期，

44
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.340
and deep sleep.
深睡期。

45
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.580
We measure these stages by connecting electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.
通过将电极与头皮，下巴和胸部相连， 我们可以记录这些睡眠阶段的电信号。

46
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.876
In light sleep and REM,
在浅睡及快速动眼期，

47
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.140
our brain waves are very similar to our brain waves in waking life.
我们的脑电波与 清醒时的脑电波几乎一致。

48
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.636
But our brain waves in deep sleep have these long-burst brain waves
但在深睡期中， 我们的脑电波却是一种长脉冲，

49
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.796
that are very different from our waking life brain waves.
与我们清醒时的脑电波大相径庭。

50
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.220
These long-burst brain waves are called delta waves.
这些长脉冲脑电波 被称为δ（delta）波。

51
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.876
When we don't get the deep sleep we need,

52
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.076
it inhibits our ability to learn

53
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.900
and for our cells and bodies to recover.
细胞再生和身体机能的 修复也会受到影响。

54
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.916
Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions
深度睡眠让我们将

55
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.636
that we make during the day
白天的经历

56
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.380
into our long-term memory and personalities.
转化为长期记忆， 让我们成为我们自己。

57
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.276
As we get older,
当我们老去，

58
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.796
we're more likely to lose these regenerative delta waves.
我们将很可能不再有 这些可再生的δ波。

59
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.636
So in way, deep sleep and delta waves
可以说，深度睡眠和δ波

60
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.300
are actually a marker for biological youth.
是生理年轻的一大标志。

61
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.036
So naturally, I wanted to get more deep sleep for myself

62
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.756
and I literally tried almost every gadget, gizmo, device and hack out there --

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.356
I learned a lot, and I found I really do need, like most people,
我学到了很多，我发现 和大多数人一样，

66
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.036
eight hours of sleep.

67
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.116
I even shifted my circadian component

68
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.836
by changing my meals, exercise and light exposure,
暴露在光照下的时间 改变了自己的生理节律，

69
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.116
but I still couldn't find a way to get a deeper night of sleep ...
