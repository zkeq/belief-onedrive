6
00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.037
that he was setting off metal detectors.

Now, I became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering,
我是一名帮助人类减轻痛苦的心理学家，

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.037
and for the past 10 years, my target has been the suffering caused by PTSD,
在过去的10年当中，我一直把像卡洛斯这样的退伍军人经历的

15
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:54.583
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.
PTSD作为我的研究目标。

16
00:00:55.176 --> 00:01:00.393
Until recently, the science of PTSD just wasn't there.
不久前，关于PTSD的研究都还不够完善。

17
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.357
And so, we didn't know what to do.
因此，我们一直都不知道要怎样应对。

18
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:05.745
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.
我们让一部分退伍军人大量服药。

19
00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.573
Others we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy,

20
00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:10.695
and others still we simply said to them,

21
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.033
"Just go home and try to forget about your experiences."
“回家吧，尝试去忘记你的经历。”

22
00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:18.697
More recently, we've tried therapy dogs, wilderness retreats --

23
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:21.642
many things which may temporarily relieve stress,

24
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.571
but which don't actually eliminate PTSD symptoms over the long term.

25
00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:27.831
But things have changed.

26
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:33.487
And I am here to tell you that we can now eliminate PTSD,

27
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.278
not just manage the symptoms,
不仅仅是缓解症状，

28
00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:36.850
and in huge numbers of veterans.
而且对大量的退伍军人都有效。

29
00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:39.852
Because new scientific research has been able to show,
因为最新的科学研究已经能够

30
00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:42.254
objectively, repeatedly,
客观地，重复地表明

31
00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:45.753
which treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not.
哪些治疗能真正消除病症，而哪些不能。

32
00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:47.425
Now as it turns out,
结果表明，

33
00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:52.679
the best treatments for PTSD use many of the very same training principles
对于PTSD的最佳治疗方式，是使用许多与军队训练战士

34
00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:56.555
that the military uses in preparing its trainees for war.
备战时相同的原则。

35
00:01:58.047 --> 00:01:59.526
Now, making war --
制造战争——

36
00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:02.379
this is something that we are good at.
这是我们擅长的事情。

37
00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:06.953
We humans have been making war since before we were even fully human.
我们人类一直都在制造战争，甚至当我们还没有完全进化就开始了。

38
00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:11.290
And since then, we have gone from using stone and sinew
自从那时起，我们已经从使用石头和肌腱，

39
00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:15.904
to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
发展到了使用能够想象到的最复杂的，最具毁灭性的武器。

40
00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:18.263
And to enable our warriors to use these weapons,
为了使我们的战士能够使用这些武器，

41
00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:20.432
we employ the most cutting-edge training methods.
我们会使用最先进的训练方式训练他们。

42
00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:22.059
We are good at making war.

43
00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:25.705
And we are good at training our warriors to fight.

44
00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:29.996
Yet, when we consider the experience of the modern-day combat veteran,
但是，当我们考虑当今老兵的经历，

45
00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:35.021
we begin to see that we have not been as good at preparing them to come home.
我们就会意识到，我们并不善于为他们回家做准备。

46
00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:36.469
Why is that?
为什么会这样呢？

47
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:40.825
Well, our ancestors lived immersed in conflict,
我们的祖先生活在冲突当中，

48
00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.227
and they fought right where they lived.
他们就在他们生活的地方进行斗争。

49
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.928
So until only very recently in our evolutionary history,
所以直到进化史的近代阶段，

50
00:02:46.952 --> 00:02:49.844
there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war,
人类都几乎没有学习如何从战场回家的需求，

51
00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:51.994
because we never really did.
因为我们从来没有真正这样做过。

52
00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:54.433
But thankfully, today,
但值得庆幸的是，当今，

53
00:02:54.463 --> 00:02:57.478
most of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies,
大多数人类都居住在和平社会当中，

54
00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:01.481
and when there is conflict, we, especially in the United States,
当冲突发生时，我们，特别是美国，

55
00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:05.002
now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training,
有这些科技，可以让我们的士兵进行先进的训练，

56
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.843
drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe
把他们扔在世界的任何角落去打仗，

57
00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.326
and when they're done,
当战争结束时，

58
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.375
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.
再把他们载回和平地区。

59
00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:16.192
But just imagine for a moment what this must feel like.
但是让我们想象一下这种感受。

60
00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:18.904
I've spoken with veterans who've told me
我和那些退伍战士聊过，他们告诉我，

61
00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:22.020
that one day they're in a brutal firefight in Afghanistan
曾经他们身处阿富汗残暴的交火当中，

62
00:03:22.044 --> 00:03:24.919
where they saw carnage and death,
目睹杀戮和死亡，

63
00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:28.157
and just three days later, they found themselves
而三天后他们就要

64
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.765
toting an ice chest to their kid's soccer game.
带着冰袋去参加孩子的足球比赛。

65
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:35.030
"Mindfuck" is the most common term.
“思想混乱”是他们最常使用的词汇。

66
00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.428
(Laughter)
（笑声）

67
00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:39.571
It's the most common term I've heard to describe that experience.
这是我听到过的最常用于描述那种经历的术语。

68
00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:41.119
And that's exactly what that is.
但那就是他们所经历的。

69
00:03:41.143 --> 00:03:45.132
Because while our warriors spend countless hours training for war,
因为当我们的战士正花费大量的时间准备战争，

70
00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:47.049
we've only recently come to understand
我们却最近才意识到，

71
00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:51.292
that many require training on how to return to civilian life.
他们中的许多也需要被训练如何回归平民生活。

72
00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:55.553
Now, like any training, the best PTSD treatments require repetition.
就像任何训练一样，最佳的PTSD治疗方案也需要被反复进行。

73
00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:56.728
In the military,
在军队中，

74
00:03:56.752 --> 00:03:59.992
we don't simply hand trainees Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers
我们不会简单地递给新兵 Mark-19自动榴弹枪，

75
00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:03.208
and say, "Here's the trigger, here's some ammo and good luck."
然后说：“这里是扳机，还有一些弹药，祝你好运。”

76
00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:07.928
No. We train them, on the range and in specific contexts,
不。我们训练他们，在场地中，在不同的环境下，

77
00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:09.638
over and over and over
一遍又一遍的，

78
00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:12.451
until lifting their weapon and engaging their target
直到举起武器瞄准目标的行为，

79
00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:14.311
is so engrained into muscle memory
根深蒂固的刻在肌肉记忆当中；

80
00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:16.663
that it can be performed without even thinking,
直到即使在你们能想象的最紧张的时刻，

81
00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:19.607
even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine.
这一系列行为也能够不经思考的被正确执行。

82
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.184
Now, the same holds for training-based treatments.
以训练为基础的治疗也是一样的道理。

83
00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:27.026
The first of these treatments is cognitive therapy,
治疗的第一步是认知疗法，

84
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.419
and this is a kind of mental recalibration.
这是一种心理的重新校准。

85
00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:32.615
When veterans come home from war,
当退伍军人从战争回家时，

86
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.235
their way of mentally framing the world is calibrated
他们对世界的认知是被校对过的，

87
00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.918
to an immensely more dangerous environment.
以适应那种极度危险的战争环境。

88
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.836
So when you try to overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment,
所以当你试图将这种认知嫁接于和平环境之上时，

89
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.065
you get problems.
就会出现问题。

90
00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.544
You begin drowning in worries about dangers that aren't present.
你就会沉浸在对那些本不存在的危险的忧虑当中。

91
00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:52.891
You begin not trusting family or friends.
你开始不信任家人和朋友。

92
00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:57.819
Which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life; there are.
不是说平民生活中就没有危险；危险是存在的。

93
00:04:57.772 --> 00:05:00.934
It's just that the probability of encountering them
只是说遇到危险的几率，

94
00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:02.208
compared to combat
相比战争中而言，

95
00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:04.540
is astronomically lower.
是极低的。

96
00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.635
So we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely.
所以我们从不建议退伍军人彻底关闭他们的警惕性。

97
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.043
We do train them, however, to adjust caution
而是训练他们，去根据所处环境，

98
00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:13.108
according to where they are.
调整他们的警惕程度。

99
00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.990
If you find yourself in a bad neighborhood,
如果你在一个治安很差的社区，

100
00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:17.269
you turn it up.
你就要开启警惕性。

101
00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:19.347
Out to dinner with family?
和家人一起在外吃饭呢？

102
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:21.299
You turn it way down.
你就应该把它调节到很低。

103
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:24.567
We train veterans to be fiercely rational,
我们训练退伍军人，让他们变得绝对理性化，

104
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:28.609
to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability
让他们能够系统化的衡量他们在

105
00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.477
of encountering, say, an IED here in peacetime America.
和平时期的美国遭遇到比如，简易爆炸装置的可能性。

106
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.873
With enough practice, those recalibrations stick.
通过足够的练习，那些被校正的认知就会留存。

107
00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:41.087
The next of these treatments is exposure therapy,
治疗的下一步是暴露疗法，

108
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.778
and this is a kind of field training,
就好像实地演习，

109
00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:47.674
and the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there.
也是所有被证明有效的疗法中见效最快的。

110
00:05:47.794 --> 00:05:49.351
You remember Carlos?
你们还记得卡洛斯吗？

111
00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:51.242
This was the treatment that he chose.
这就是他选择的治疗方案。

112
00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.129
And so we started off by giving him exercises,
我们从给他一些练习开始，

113
00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.459
for him, challenging ones:
对他来说，最具挑战性的是：

114
00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:57.429
going to a grocery store,
去杂货店，

115
00:05:57.453 --> 00:06:00.078
going to a shopping mall, going to a restaurant,
去商场，餐厅，

116
00:06:00.102 --> 00:06:02.592
sitting with his back to the door.
背对着门坐着。

117
00:06:02.764 --> 00:06:04.779
And, critically --
而且，最重要的是——

118
00:06:04.852 --> 00:06:06.365
staying in these environments.
要停留在这些环境当中。

119
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:09.321
Now, at first he was very anxious.
刚开始的时候，他表现得非常不安。

120
00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:11.837
He wanted to sit where he could scan the room,
他希望能够坐在一个可以扫视整个餐厅的位置，

121
00:06:11.861 --> 00:06:13.786
where he could plan escape routes,
这样他就可以计划逃脱路线，

122
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.837
where he could get his hands on a makeshift weapon.
这样他就可以随手拿取临时武器。

123
00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:19.701
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.
他很想离开那儿，但是他没有。

124
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.111
He remembered his training in the Marine Corps,
他想起了在海军陆战队的训练，

125
00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:24.949
and he pushed through his discomfort.
他战胜了自己的不安情绪。

126
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.542
And every time he did this, his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,
每当他这样做时，焦虑感就会逐渐减少，

127
00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:31.325
and then a little bit more and then a little bit more,
然后再减少一点点，再减少一点儿，

128
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.663
until in the end,
直到最后，

129
00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:37.597
he had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space
他重新学会了如何坐在公共场所当中，

130
00:06:38.605 --> 00:06:40.089
and just enjoy himself.
仅仅是享受他自己的时光。

131
00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:44.842
He also listened to recordings of his combat experiences,
他也会听他战时经历的录音，

132
00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:47.047
over and over and over.
一遍又一遍的。

133
00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:51.766
He listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety.
他听这些录音，直到不再对其产生焦虑。

134
00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:54.801
He processed his memories so much
他不断消化那些记忆，

135
00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:59.363
that his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences in his sleep.
以至于不需要再在梦里回到那些记忆当中。

136
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.773
And when I spoke with him a year after treatment had finished,
当我在他治疗结束一年之后再与他交流时，

137
00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:05.168
he told me,
他告诉我：

138
00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:09.593
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years
“医生，这是我在43年当中

139
00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.878
that I haven't had nightmares."
第一次没有做噩梦。”

140
00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:17.410
Now, this is different than erasing a memory.
然而，这并不是清除记忆的过程。

141
00:07:17.907 --> 00:07:20.902
Veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences,
退伍军人们会永远记得他们的创痛经历，

142
00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:22.583
but with enough practice,
但是通过足够量的训练，
