1
00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.962
So, there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman.
有一位演员叫做达斯汀·霍夫曼。

2
00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:20.653
And years ago, he made this movie which some of you may have heard of, called "The Graduate."
几十年前，他拍了一部电影，你们可能听说过叫做《毕业生》。

3
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:23.694
And there's two key scenes in that movie.
电影中有两个关键的场景。

4
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:26.473
The first one is the seduction scene.
一个是勾引的画面。

5
00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:28.490
I'm not going to talk about that tonight.
但是这不是我今晚的主题，

6
00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:29.981
(Laughter)
（笑声）

7
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:34.595
The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool,
在第二个场景中，他被一位长者带到游泳场边

8
00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:39.638
and as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word,
作为一位毕业生，长者只对他说了一个词，

9
00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:40.851
just one word.
仅仅一个词。

10
00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.947
And of course, all of you know what that word is.
当然，你们都知道那个词

11
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:45.161
It's "plastics."
就是“塑料”。

12
00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:46.351
(Laughter)
（笑声）

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.942
And the only problem with that is, it was completely the wrong advice.
但现在问题是，他给出的建议完全错了。

14
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.453
(Laughter)
（笑声）

15
00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.197
Let me tell you why it was so wrong.
让我来给你们讲讲为什么错了。

16
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.014
The word should have been "silicon."
因为这个词应该是“硅”。

17
00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.007
And the reason it should have been silicon
为什么说应该是硅呢？

18
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:06.613
is because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made, had already been filed,
因为那时半导体的专利已经得以注册，

19
00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:08.402
and they were already building them.
人们已经建立了半导体产业城。

20
00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:11.513
So Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967,
所以硅谷就是在1967年建立的，

21
00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.345
when this movie was released.
正好是这部电影发行的那一年。

22
00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.457
And the year after the movie was released,
在电影发行的第二年

23
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:16.646
Intel was founded.
因特尔公司成立了。

24
00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:19.973
So had the graduate heard the right one word,
所以说如果这位毕业生听到了正确的答案，

25
00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:24.711
maybe he would have ended up onstage -- oh, I don't know -- maybe with these two.
或许他就会和这两位一样出现在台上。

26
00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:27.614
(Laughter)
（笑声）

27
00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:33.486
So as you're thinking of that,
那么，想想看

28
00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:37.884
let's see what bit of advice we might want to give
我们现在会给出什么建议，

29
00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:41.498
so that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman.
不要让我们的毕业生最后沦落为特百惠的销售员。

30
00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:43.402
(Laughter)
（笑声）

31
00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:47.171
So in 2015, what word of advice would you give people,
在2015年，当你把一位毕业生带到游泳池边

32
00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:49.836
when you took a college graduate out by the pool
你会说什么词呢，只说一个词，

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.750
and you said one word, just one word?
你给人们的建议会是什么词呢？

34
00:01:52.518 --> 00:01:54.518
I think the answer would be "lifecode."
我想这个答案应该是“生命密码”。

35
00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:56.291
So what is "lifecode?"
到底什么是“生命密码”呢？

36
00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.052
Lifecode is the various ways we have of programming life.
生命密码是我们为生命编程的各种各样的方式。

37
00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.911
So instead of programming computers,
也就说我们并非在电脑上编程，

38
00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.608
we're using things to program viruses
而是运用工具来编译病毒

39
00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:05.656
or retroviruses or proteins
逆转录病毒、蛋白质

40
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.488
or DNA or RNA
DNA、RNA

41
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:10.964
or plants or animals, or a whole series of creatures.
动植物以及一系列的生物。

42
00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:13.982
And as you're thinking about this incredible ability
如各位所想，这项惊人的能力

43
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:16.259
to make life do what you want it to do,
可以让生命按照程序编写的一样

44
00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:20.217
what it's programmed to do, what you end up doing
做你想让它做的事得到你想得到的结果。

45
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:23.686
is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years,
那些已经进行了上千年的事情：

46
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.831
which is breeding, changing,
各种生命形式的

47
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.926
mixing, matching
繁殖、改变

48
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.959
all kinds of life-forms,
杂交、匹配

49
00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.444
and we accelerate it.
我们加速了这一过程。

50
00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:33.968
And this is not something new.
这并不是一件新鲜事

51
00:02:33.992 --> 00:02:36.292
This humble mustard weed has been modified
这株芥菜经过了基因修饰，

52
00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.988
so that if you change it in one way, you get broccoli.
如果你以某种方式进行改变，它就变成了西兰花。

53
00:02:40.534 --> 00:02:43.060
And if you change it in a second way, you get kale.
如果你换一种方式，它就变成了甘蓝。

54
00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:45.600
And if you change it in a third way,
如果用第三种方式，

55
00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:46.893
you get cauliflower.
得到的就是花椰菜。

56
00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:50.834
So when you go to these all-natural, organic markets,
所以当你去纯天然的有机菜场时，

57
00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.438
you're really going to a place
你所看到的蔬菜

58
00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:56.421
where people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time.
的生命密码在很久以前就被改变了。

59
00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:58.448
The difference today,
如今所不同的

60
00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:00.717
to pick a completely politically neutral term --
只是挑一个政治立场上完全中性的词来形容它。

61
00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:02.432
[Intelligent design]
[智能设计]

62
00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:03.613
(Laughter)
（笑声）

63
00:03:03.637 --> 00:03:06.043
We're beginning to practice intelligent design.
我们正在进行智能设计的实践

64
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.877
That means that instead of doing this at random
这意味着我们不能随意地进行试验

65
00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:10.957
and seeing what happens over generations,
然后看看几代后会发生什么。

66
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:14.667
we're inserting specific genes, we're inserting specific proteins,
我们需要插入特定的基因和特定的蛋白质，

67
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:17.898
and we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes.
然后根据我们的目的修改生命密码，

68
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.659
And that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens.
从而加速试验的结果。

69
00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:24.031
Let me just give you one example.
让我举个例子。

70
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.643
Some of you occasionally might think about sex.
你们当中可能有人会偶尔产生性欲。

71
00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.348
And we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex.
我们已经对性爱的改变习以为常。

72
00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:37.280
So we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it.
所以我们认为这种改变非常正常和自然。

73
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.119
What's happened with sex over time is --
过去，性爱的发生

74
00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:42.831
normally, sex equals baby, eventually.
通常来讲，最后就意味着孩子。

75
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:45.301
But in today's world,
但是，在今天的社会，

76
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:48.204
sex plus pill equals no baby.
性+药=没有孩子

77
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.712
(Laughter)
（笑声）

78
00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:52.474
And again, we think that's perfectly normal and natural,
再次强调我们认为这是很自然很正常的

79
00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.348
but that has not been the case for most of human history.
但在人类历史中几乎没有这样的例子发生，

80
00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:57.023
And it's not the case for animals.
动物身上也没有。

81
00:03:57.428 --> 00:03:59.410
What it is does is it gives us control,
这样的改变让我们摆脱了束缚

82
00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.873
so sex becomes separate from conception.
因此性和怀孕不再有必然联系。

83
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.220
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,
你可以想象到这样的结果

84
00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:06.908
then we've been playing with stuff
接着我们开始使用一些技术

85
00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:09.243
that's a little bit more advanced, like art.
一些先进的技术，比如“艺术”。

86
00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.345
Not in the sense of painting and sculpture,
不是在绘画和雕塑意义上的艺术，

87
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:16.046
but in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies.
是指辅助生殖技术。

88
00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:19.661
So what are assisted reproductive technologies?
什么是辅助生殖技术呢？

89
00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:23.403
Assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization.
这是一种类似体外受精的技术。

90
00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:27.658
And when you do in vitro fertilization, there's very good reasons to do it.
有时可能有人无法怀孕

91
00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:30.802
Sometimes you just can't conceive otherwise.
那么选择体外受精无疑是一个好选择。

92
00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:32.597
But when you do that,
但是通过体外受精

93
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:36.683
what you’re doing is separating sex, conception, baby.
性、怀孕和孩子就完全分离开来。

94
00:04:37.606 --> 00:04:40.510
So you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby,
所以你不仅可以决定生孩子的时间，

95
00:04:40.534 --> 00:04:43.858
you've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized.
还可以将受精的时间和地点分离开来。

96
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.471
So you've separated the baby from the body from the act.
所以你可以把孩子和身体和性爱都分开。

97
00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:52.232
And as you're thinking of other things we've been doing,
再举个例子，

98
00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:54.114
think about twins.
比如双胞胎。

99
00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.969
So you can freeze sperm, you can freeze eggs,
你可以冻结精子，可以冻结卵子

100
00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:58.690
you can freeze fertilized eggs.
你也可以冻结受精卵。

101
00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.363
And what does that mean?
这意味着什么呢？

102
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.881
Well, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient.
如果你是一位癌症患者，这绝对是一件好事。

103
00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:06.909
You're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation,
你即将要接受化疗和放疗，

104
00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:08.163
so you save these things.
所以你需要保存生殖细胞或受精卵

105
00:05:08.187 --> 00:05:09.424
You don't irradiate them.
这样它们就可以免遭辐射。

106
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:12.218
But if you can save them and you can freeze them,
但是，如果你可以保存它们，冻结它们，

107
00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:14.344
and you can have a surrogate mother,
甚至可以找一位代孕母亲，

108
00:05:14.368 --> 00:05:16.527
it means that you've decoupled sex from time.
这就意味着你可以使性脱离时间的束缚。

109
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.448
It means you can have twins born -- oh, in 50 years?
也就是说你可以生下一对相差50岁的双胞胎？

110
00:05:23.107 --> 00:05:26.796
(Laughter)
（笑声）

111
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.077
In a hundred years?
或许相差100年？

112
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.450
Two hundred years?
200年？

113
00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:34.173
And these are three really profound changes
这些影响深远的改变

114
00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:35.796
that are not, like, future stuff.
这并不是将来的东西，

115
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.937
This is stuff we take for granted today.
这是我们今天认为理所当然的事情。

116
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:41.660
So this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower.
因此生命密码蕴含强大的力量。

117
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.676
It turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses,
它以一种难以置信地方式改变病毒，

118
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.884
of changing plants, of changing animals,
改变植物，改变动物，

119
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.914
perhaps even of evolving ourselves.
甚至可以让我们自己进化。

120
00:05:51.938 --> 00:05:55.680
It's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while.
史蒂夫·加兰和我对于生命密码有过一些思考。

121
00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:57.728
Let's have some risks.
我们先说一些危险的情况。

122
00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:02.372
Like every powerful technology, like electricity, like an automobile,
就像所有有力的科技一样，比如电力、汽车

123
00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.705
like computers, this stuff potentially can be misused.
还有电脑，生命密码也可能会被用于歧途。

124
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:08.022
And that scares a lot of people.
这吓坏了很多人。

125
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.605
And as you apply these technologies,
当你在使用这些科技时

126
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.881
you can even turn human beings into chimeras.
你甚至可以把人变成怪物。

127
00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:16.174
Remember the Greek myth where you mix animals?
大家记得希腊神话中动物互相交配么？

128
00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:17.856
Well, some of these treatments
有一些治疗的结果

129
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:20.454
actually end up changing your blood type.
甚至会让你改变血型

130
00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:25.405
Or they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa,
或者他们会把男性细胞和女性细胞放入对方体内，

131
00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:27.734
which sounds absolutely horrible
听起来无比可怕。

132
00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:30.035
until you realize, the reason you're doing that
其实你发现这就是

133
00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.464
is you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments.
你在癌症治疗过程中替换骨髓的过程。

134
00:06:33.488 --> 00:06:35.736
So by taking somebody else's bone marrow,
从别人身体上得到的骨髓

135
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.452
you may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself,
也许会改变你自己的基本情况，

136
00:06:38.476 --> 00:06:40.364
but you're also saving your life.
但同时也救了你的命。

137
00:06:40.388 --> 00:06:42.534
And as you're thinking about this stuff,
如果你仔细想想，

138
00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:44.728
here's something that happened 20 years ago.
这个技术已经存在20年了。

139
00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:46.682
This is Emma Ott.
这是艾玛·奥特。

140
00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.515
She's a recent college admittee.
她是个在校大学生。

141
00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.444
She's studying accounting.
她主修会计。

142
00:06:51.468 --> 00:06:54.832
She played two varsity sports. She graduated as a valedictorian.
她是两种体育的校队成员还作为学生代表进行了毕业演讲。

143
00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:57.527
And that's not particularly extraordinary,
这都没有什么特别的，

144
00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:01.122
except that she's the first human being born to three parents.
但是她是第一个三亲家庭的孩子。

145
00:07:02.064 --> 00:07:03.215
Why?
为什么？

146
00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:06.914
Because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease that she might have inherited.
因为她很可能通过遗传得了一种线粒体疾病。

147
00:07:06.938 --> 00:07:09.319
So when you swap out a third person's DNA
当你把第三个人的DNA

148
00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:11.071
and you put it in there,
植入这些人的体内，

149
00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:12.652
you save the lives of people.
他们就可以活下来。

150
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.041
But you also are doing germline engineering,
同时使用生殖工程学的技术，

151
00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:20.208
which means her kids, if she has kids, will be saved
如果她有孩子，她的孩子也将

152
00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:21.642
and won't go through this.
永远免于这种疾病的侵害。

153
00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.157
And [their] kids will be saved,
她的后代，

154
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.016
and their grandchildren will be saved,
和她的后代的后代

155
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.237
and this passes on.
都会被挽救。

156
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:28.374
That makes people nervous.
这让人们紧张。

157
00:07:28.398 --> 00:07:30.748
So 20 years ago, the various authorities said,
所以20年前，很多专家表示

158
00:07:30.772 --> 00:07:32.691
why don't we study this for a while?
为什么我们不先研究一下再推广这些技术呢？

159
00:07:33.723 --> 00:07:37.537
There are risks to doing stuff, and there are risks to not doing stuff,
使用这些技术是有风险的但是不用这些技术问题就会继续，

160
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.909
because there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology,
我们已经使用这些救了很多人。

161
00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:43.917
and then we've been thinking about it for the next 20 years.
我们已经思考了20年。

162
00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:46.005
So as we think about it,
这期间我们不停地说：

163
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:49.839
as we take the time to say, "Hey, maybe we should have longer studies,
“也许我们需要更长时间的研究”，

164
00:07:49.863 --> 00:07:52.264
maybe we should do this, maybe we should do that,"
“也许我们要做这个也许要做那个”，

165
00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:56.097
there are consequences to acting, and there are consequences to not acting.
凡事都是有两面性的。用科技治愈致命的疾病也不例外。

166
00:07:57.023 --> 00:07:58.716
Like curing deadly diseases --
治愈致命的疾病

167
00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:01.746
which, by the way, is completely unnatural.
其实是非常反常的。

168
00:08:02.817 --> 00:08:05.899
It is normal and natural for humans to be felled
如果人类死于大量的传染病

169
00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:09.992
by massive epidemics of polio, of smallpox, of tuberculosis.
比如脊髓灰质炎，天花，肺结核，那是非常正常的。

170
00:08:10.016 --> 00:08:15.049
When we put vaccines into people, we are putting unnatural things into their body
在人体体内疫苗就是一件很不正常的事，

171
00:08:15.073 --> 00:08:19.182
because we think the benefit outweighs the risk.
但是我们认为利大于弊。

172
00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:23.662
Because we've built unnatural plants, unnatural animals,
因为我们培养了特殊的植株特殊的动物，

173
00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:25.859
we can feed about seven billion people.
我们才可以养育这70亿人。

174
00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:29.405
We can do things like create new life-forms.
我们可以创造新的生物

175
00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:35.344
And as you create new life-forms, again, that sounds terribly scary and terribly bothersome,
乍一听创造新生物实在太恐怖太可怕，

176
00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:38.812
until you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table.
其实你在餐厅的桌子上就可以看到那些新生物。

177
00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:41.856
Those flowers you've got on your dining room table --
餐厅桌子上买回来的鲜花

178
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.049
there's not a lot that's natural about them,
和自然完全沾不上边，

179
00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:47.165
because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color,
因为人类一直在选育固定的颜色

180
00:08:47.189 --> 00:08:48.949
to be this size, to last for a week.
固定的尺寸，以及强大的生存能力。

181
00:08:48.973 --> 00:08:51.362
You don't usually give your loved one wildflowers
你通常不会放野花在这

182
00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:54.353
because they don't last a whole lot of time.
因为它们活不了多久。

183
00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:57.590
What all this does
这一切的一切

184
00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:00.416
is it flips Darwin completely on his head.
都完全颠覆了达尔文的理论。

185
00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:02.720
See, for four billion years,
40亿年前，

186
00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:05.809
what lived and died on this planet depended on two principles:
地球上生物能否生存取决于两个原则：

187
00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:08.952
on natural selection and random mutation.
自然选择和基因突变。

188
00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:12.463
And so what lived and died, what was structured,
而这两个原则

189
00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:14.670
has now been flipped on its head.
现在已经被完全颠覆了。

190
00:09:16.082 --> 00:09:17.281
And what we've done
我们正在

191
00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:19.916
is created this completely parallel evolutionary system
创造一个完全并行的进化系统

192
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.269
where we are practicing unnatural selection and non-random mutation.
这个系统里我们尝试着非自然选择和定向变异。

193
00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:24.988
So let me explain these things.
让我来解释一下：

194
00:09:25.012 --> 00:09:26.401
This is natural selection.
这是自然选择。

195
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.315
This is unnatural selection.
这是非自然选择。

196
00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:30.961
(Laughter)
（笑声）

197
00:09:31.723 --> 00:09:34.367
So what happens with this stuff is,
狗这个物种实际上

198
00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:39.319
we started breeding wolves thousands of years ago in central Asia to turn them into dogs.
是几千年前的中亚人通过驯养狼得到的物种。

199
00:09:39.343 --> 00:09:41.637
And then we started turning them into big dogs
然后我们开始把狗培育成大狗

200
00:09:41.661 --> 00:09:43.412
and into little dogs.
或者小狗。

201
00:09:43.436 --> 00:09:48.095
But if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue
但是如果你带着一只第五大街上的某个爱马仕包里的吉娃娃

202
00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:50.776
and you let it loose on the African plain,
去非洲平原放生

203
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.784
you can watch natural selection happen.
你就可以看到自然选择的发生。

204
00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:55.489
(Laughter)
（笑声）

205
00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:01.056
Few things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield.
地球上没有比玉米地更不自然的了。

206
00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:05.581
You will never, under any scenario, walk through a virgin forest
如果你进入原始森林你永远不可能看到

207
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.638
and see the same plant growing in orderly rows at the same time,
同一种植株在同一时刻整齐的排列，

208
00:10:09.662 --> 00:10:11.273
nothing else living there.
什么别的植物都没有。

209
00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:13.377
When you do a cornfield,
你在种植玉米的时候，

210
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:15.448
you're selecting what lives and what dies.
你决定了什么生什么死。

211
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.239
And you're doing that through unnatural selection.
你在进行非自然选择。

212
00:10:18.263 --> 00:10:21.400
It's the same with a wheat field, it's the same with a rice field.
麦田也一样，稻田也一样，

213
00:10:21.424 --> 00:10:24.039
It's the same with a city, it's the same with a suburb.
城市也一样，郊区也一样。

214
00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:25.958
In fact, half the surface of Earth
事实地球上一半的地区

215
00:10:25.982 --> 00:10:27.489
has been unnaturally engineered
都是人工控制的结果

216
00:10:27.513 --> 00:10:30.696
so that what lives and what dies there is what we want,
这些地区我们决定物种的生死。

217
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.134
which is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears walking through downtown Manhattan.
所以你不可能在曼哈顿的街区看到灰熊走来走去。

218
00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:38.756
How about this random mutation stuff?
基因突变是什么呢？

219
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.223
Well, this is random mutation.
这就是基因突变。

220
00:10:40.247 --> 00:10:41.587
This is Antonio Alfonseca.
这是安东尼奥·艾方塞卡，

221
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.881
He's otherwise known as the Octopus, his nickname.
他还有一个外号叫做章鱼

222
00:10:44.905 --> 00:10:47.179
He was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in 2000.
他是2000年的最佳替补投手。

223
00:10:47.775 --> 00:10:52.791
And he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on each hand,
基因突变让他每只手都拥有六根手指。

224
00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:55.457
which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher.
这对他投球帮助很大。

225
00:10:55.481 --> 00:10:57.121
(Laughter)
（笑声）

226
00:10:57.939 --> 00:10:59.669
How about non-random mutation?
那什么是非随机突变呢？

227
00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:04.930
A non-random mutation is beer. It's wine. It's yogurt.
啤酒，葡萄酒，酸奶都是非随机突变。

228
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.084
How many times have you walked through the forest
你在森林里走的时候

229
00:11:08.108 --> 00:11:09.671
and found all-natural cheese?
看见一块纯天然的奶酪的几率有多大呢

230
00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:11.922
Or all-natural yogurt?
纯天然酸奶呢？

231
00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:14.651
So we've been engineering this stuff.
这些都是非随机突变的结果。

232
00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.143
Now, the interesting thing is,
有趣的是，

233
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:17.785
we get to know the stuff better.
现在我们对于突变了解的更多了。

234
00:11:18.184 --> 00:11:23.708
We found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments, CRISPR, inside yogurt.
我们在酸奶中发现了基因编辑的有力武器 CRISPR。

235
00:11:24.848 --> 00:11:26.838
And as we start engineering cells,
我们开始控制细胞

236
00:11:26.862 --> 00:11:31.142
we're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products,
利用这个工具制造十种最常用药物中的八种

237
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.591
including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis,
包括治疗关节炎的

238
00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:37.041
which is the number one best-selling drug, Humira.
特效药，修美乐。

239
00:11:37.805 --> 00:11:39.256
So this lifecode stuff.
生命密码就是这些东西。

240
00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:41.425
It really is a superpower.
它真的超级强大。

241
00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:43.890
It really is a way of programming stuff,
真的就像在编码生物一样，

242
00:11:43.914 --> 00:11:48.621
and there's nothing that's going to change us more than this lifecode.
再也不会有比生命密码对于人类的改变更大的改变了。

243
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.398
So as you're thinking of lifecode,
所以在思考生命密码的时候，

244
00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:53.111
let's think of five principles
在开始准备使用它的时候，

245
00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:55.906
as to how we start guiding,
我们要遵守五个原则。

246
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.549
and I'd love you to give me more.
我希望各位可以给我更多启发。

247
00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.637
So, principle number one:
原则一：

248
00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:02.245
we have to take responsibility for this stuff.
我们要承担对生命密码的责任。

249
00:12:02.862 --> 00:12:05.413
The reason we have to take responsibility
之所以我们要肩负起责任

250
00:12:05.437 --> 00:12:06.798
is because we're in charge.
是因为我们是使用者。

251
00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:08.735
These aren't random mutations.
这不是随机的突变。

252
00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:11.062
This is what we are doing, what we are choosing.
这是我们的选择，我们的工作

253
00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:12.785
It's not, "Stuff happened."
这不是“事情就这样发生了”

254
00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:14.282
It didn't happen at random.
这既不是随机发生的。

255
00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:16.910
It didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else.
也不会随着别人的决定而消失。

256
00:12:16.934 --> 00:12:18.751
We engineer this stuff,
我们制造了它，

257
00:12:18.775 --> 00:12:22.020
and it's the Pottery Barn rule: you break it, you own it.
根据珀特里·巴恩的原则：你破坏了规则，你就要对它负责。

258
00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:24.311
Principle number two:
原则二：

259
00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:27.463
we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff.
我们必须明白并且鼓励物种的多样性。

260
00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:32.367
There have been at least 33 versions of hominids that have walked around this Earth.
曾经至少有33种原始人存在于这个世界上。

261
00:12:32.732 --> 00:12:35.038
Most all of them went extinct except us.
除了我们之外绝大多数已经灭绝。

262
00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:37.785
But the normal and natural state of this Earth
但是正常情况下的地球

263
00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:41.196
is we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time,
应该有不同种的人类同时存在

264
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.877
which is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us.
这也是为什么很多人有尼安德特人

265
00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:46.819
Some of us have some Denisova in us.
和丹尼索瓦人的特征。

266
00:12:46.843 --> 00:12:49.192
And some in Washington have a lot more of it.
一些华盛顿的政客好像有更多类似的特征。

267
00:12:49.216 --> 00:12:51.794
(Laughter)
（笑声）

268
00:12:51.818 --> 00:12:53.703
Principle number three:
原则三：

269
00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:55.892
we have to respect other people's choices.
尊重他人的选择。

270
00:12:56.428 --> 00:12:58.703
Some people will choose to never alter.
有人选择不改变，

271
00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:00.537
Some people will choose to alter all.
有人选择改变，

272
00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:03.187
Some people will choose to alter plants but not animals.
有人选择改变植物但是不改变动物，

273
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:05.262
Some people will choose to alter themselves.
有人选择改变自己。

274
00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.549
Some people will choose to evolve themselves.
有人选择进化自己。

275
00:13:07.573 --> 00:13:09.142
Diversity is not a bad thing,
多样性是好的，

276
00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:11.808
because even though we think of humans as very diverse,
尽管我们认为人类多样性已经很丰富了，

277
00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:14.117
we came so close to extinction
但是因为我们来自同一位非洲母亲的基因，

278
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.756
that all of us descend from a single African mother
我们也有灭绝的危险。

279
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.105
and the consequence of that
而且它的后果是，

280
00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:22.634
is there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees
55只非洲黑猩猩的基因的多样性

281
00:13:22.658 --> 00:13:24.533
than there are in seven billion humans.
都比70亿人类丰富得多。

282
00:13:26.074 --> 00:13:28.076
Principle number four:
原则四：

283
00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:30.899
we should take about a quarter of the Earth
我们应该让四分之一的世界

284
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.880
and only let Darwin run the show there.
遵循达尔文的原则。

285
00:13:34.801 --> 00:13:36.402
It doesn't have to be contiguous,
这四分之一的世界不用连在一起，

286
00:13:36.426 --> 00:13:38.200
doesn't have to all be tied together.
也不用被绑定在一起看待。

287
00:13:38.224 --> 00:13:40.430
It should be part in the oceans, part on land.
但是要有部分的海洋和部分的陆地。

288
00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:43.837
But we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet.
