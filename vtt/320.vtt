00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.555
"We're declaring war against cancer,
“我们已经和癌症宣战了，

2
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.180
and we will win this war by 2015."
而且我们能在2015年前赢得这场战争。”

3
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.996
This is what the US Congress and the National Cancer Institute declared
这是美国国会和国家癌症协会

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.580
just a few years ago, in 2003.
在几年前，即2003年宣布的。

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.476
Now, I don't know about you, but I don't buy that.
现在，我不知道你们对这事儿怎么看，但是我并不相信。

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.556
I don't think we quite won this war yet,
我不认为我们已经赢得这场战争了，

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.220
and I don't think anyone here will question that.
而且我不认为在场的人会质疑我。

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.116
Now, I will argue that a primary reason
现在我会告诉你们一个最基本的原因，

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.276
why we're not winning this war against cancer
为什么我们不会赢得和癌症的战争:

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.596
is because we're fighting blindly.
是因为我们在盲目地斗争。

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.195
I'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine.
我要给你们分享一个我的好朋友的故事。

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.436
His name is Ehud,
他的名字是埃胡德，

13
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.596
and a few years ago, Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.
几年前，他被诊断出有脑癌。

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.476
And not just any type of brain cancer:
而且还不是普通的脑癌，

15
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.676
he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.
他被诊断出患有最致命的一种脑癌。

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.916
In fact, it was so deadly
事实上，这个癌症致命到

17
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.596
that the doctors told him that they only have 12 months,
医生告诉他，他只有12个月，

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.036
and during those 12 months, they have to find a treatment.
在这个12个月里，他们必须要找到一种治疗方法。

19
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.516
They have to find a cure,
他们必须要找到一种有效的治疗方法，

20
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.700
and if they cannot find a cure, he will die.
而且如果找不到，他将会死亡。

21
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.076
Now, the good news, they said,
现在，好消息是，他们说，

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.036
is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from,
有无数种治疗方法可以选择，

23
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.276
but the bad news is
而坏消息是，

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.836
that in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not,
如果要检测一种治疗方法是否有效，

25
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.356
well, that takes them about three months or so.
好吧，需要大约三个月的时间。

26
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.756
So they cannot try that many things.
所以他们尝试不了几种方法。

27
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.876
Well, Ehud is now going into his first treatment,
现在，埃胡德正在进行他的第一次治疗，

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.156
and during that first treatment, just a few days into that treatment,
在第一次治疗开始几天的时候，

29
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.516
I'm meeting with him, and he tells me, "Adam, I think this is working.
我见到他，他告诉我说 “亚当，我觉得疗程有效果。

30
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.356
I think we really lucked out here. Something is happening."
我觉得我们挺走运的。事情正在改变。”

31
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.836
And I ask him, "Really? How do you know that, Ehud?"
我问他：“真的吗，你是怎么知道，埃胡德？”

32
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.076
And he says, "Well, I feel so terrible inside.
他说，“因为，我感觉身体十分难受。

33
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.956
Something's gotta be working up there.
一定有什么东西在里面起作用，

34
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.196
It just has to."
一定是的。”

35
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.660
Well, unfortunately, three months later, we got the news, it didn't work.
然而，不幸的是，三个月后，我们得到消息，治疗没有效果。

36
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.396
And so Ehud goes into his second treatment.
所以埃胡德尝试第二种治疗方法。

37
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.676
And again, the same story.
跟第一次一样，

38
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.436
"It feels so bad, something's gotta be working there."
他说“我感觉很糟，一定有什么东西在里面起作用。”

39
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.396
And then three months later, again we get bad news.
三个月后，我们又接到了坏消息。

40
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.356
Ehud is going into his third treatment, and then his fourth treatment.
然后埃胡德接受了第三次治疗，第四次治疗，

41
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.900
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.
然后正如预测的一样，埃胡德去世了。

42
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.196
Now, when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle,
当你身边亲近的人经受这种巨大的折磨时，

43
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.036
you get really swamped with emotions.
你会感觉尤其强烈。

44
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.156
A lot of things are going through your head.
你的脑海中会充斥着各种想法。

45
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.636
For me, it was mostly outrage.
对于我来说，我感觉很愤怒。

46
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.356
I was just outraged that, how come this is the best that we can offer?
我愤怒的是，难道这就是我们能为病人提供的最好的办法吗？

47
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.676
And I started looking more and more into this.
然后我开始深入地研究这件事，

48
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.156
As it turns out, this is not just the best that doctors could offer Ehud.
我发现，这并不是是医生能够提供给埃胡德最好的办法，

49
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.996
It's not just the best doctors could offer patients with brain cancer generally.
而且这也不是医生能够提供给一般脑癌病人最好的办法。

50
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.220
We're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer.
我们在治疗癌症这件事情上并没有做得很好。

51
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.916
I picked up one of those statistics,
我挑选了一些统计数据，

52
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.716
and I'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before.
我相信你们可能有人曾经看过这些数据。

53
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.196
This is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer,
这组数据统计了死于癌症的病人数量，

54
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.556
in this case females in the United States, ever since the 1930s.
确切的说是有多少美国女性，自从20世纪30年代以来死于癌症。

55
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.756
You'll notice that there aren't that many things that have changed.
你会发现从那儿以来事情并没有什么大的改变。

56
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.076
It's still a huge issue.
这依旧是一个巨大的问题。

57
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.836
You'll see a few changes, though.
当然，你能看到一些改变，

58
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.396
You'll see lung cancer, for example, on the rise.
你会发现，比如，肺癌的比例在升高。

59
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.620
Thank you, cigarettes.
拜香烟所赐。

60
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.676
And you'll also see that, for example, stomach cancer
你还能看到，比如说，胃癌，

61
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.036
once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers,
曾经癌症中最大的杀手之一，

62
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.500
is essentially eliminated.
已经几乎绝迹了。

63
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.356
Now, why is that? Anyone knows, by the way?
好，为什么会这样呢？有人知道吗？

64
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.716
Why is it that humanity is no longer struck by stomach cancer?
为什么人类不再受胃癌折磨？

65
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.596
What was the huge, huge medical technology breakthrough
是哪个巨大的医疗技术突破

66
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.980
that came to our world that saved humanity from stomach cancer?
于胃癌中拯救了人类？

67
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.876
Was it maybe a new drug, or a better diagnostic?
是一种新药或者一种更好的诊断吗？

68
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.196
You guys are right, yeah.
你们答对啦！（笑）

69
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.836
It's the invention of the refrigerator,
是因为我们发明的了冰箱，

70
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.476
and the fact that we're no longer eating spoiled meats.
于是我们不再吃变质的食物。

71
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.796
So the best thing that happened to us so far
所以至今，

72
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.756
in the medical arena in cancer research
我们在癌症研究的医疗领域取得的最大的成就，

73
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.971
is the fact that the refrigerator was invented.
是冰箱的发明。

74
00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:33.196
(Laughter)
（笑声）

75
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.476
And so -- yeah, I know.
所以，是的。

76
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.916
We're not doing so well here.
我们并没有做的很好。

77
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.276
I don't want to miniaturize the progress
我不想贬低

78
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.676
and everything that's been done in cancer research.
我们在癌症研究方面取得的进步。

79
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.116
Look, there is like 50-plus years of good cancer research
你看，我们做了五十多年的癌症研究，

80
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.556
that discovered major, major things that taught us about cancer.
发现了有关癌症的很多重要的知识。

81
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.316
But all that said,
这些年研究的结果就是，

82
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.912
we have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us.
关于治疗癌症我们依然任重道远。

83
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.836
Again, I will argue that the primary reason why this is the case,
我认为，之所以我们进展缓慢，

84
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.860
why we have not done that remarkably well,
之所以我们并没有取得突破性的成绩

85
00:03:59.884 --> 00:04:01.716
is really we're fighting blindly here.
是因为我们一直在盲目地斗争。

86
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.956
And this is where medical imaging comes in.
所以我们发明了医疗影像，

87
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.660
This is where my own work comes in.
这就是我的工作成果。

88
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.956
And so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging
下面我给大家演示一下

89
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.476
that's offered today to brain cancer patients,
当前我们能给脑癌患者提供的最好的医疗影像，

90
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.676
or actually generally to all cancer patients,
或者应该说是给所以癌症患者提供的最好的医疗影像

91
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.636
take a look at this PET scan right here.
看一看这个PET扫描，

92
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.156
Let's see. There we go. So this is a PET/CT scan,
好，这是一个PET/CT扫描，

93
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.636
and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan
你能从这个PET／CT扫描中看到什么呢？

94
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.876
is the CT scan will show you where the bones are,
CT扫描能够告诉你骨头的位置，

95
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.300
and the PET scan will show you where tumors are.
PET扫描则能告诉你肿瘤的位置。

96
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.996
Now, what you can see here
现在，你可以看到，

97
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.436
is essentially a sugar molecule
一个糖分子

98
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.276
that was added a small little tag
被添加了一个小小的标签，

99
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.396
that is signaling to us outside of the body,
在给我们发信号，

100
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.716
"Hey, I'm here."
“嗨，我在这。”

101
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.556
And those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions,
上十亿那样的糖分子被注射进病人体内，

102
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.276
and they're going all over the body
并散布至全身，

103
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.380
looking for cells that are hungry for sugar.
寻找需要糖分的细胞。

104
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.796
You'll see that the heart, for example, lights up there.
你会看到，比如说，心脏部位是亮的，

105
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.036
That's because the heart needs a lot of sugar.
那是因为心脏需要很多糖。

106
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.396
You'll also see that the bladder lights up there.
你还会看到膀胱也是亮的。

107
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.460
That's because the bladder is the thing that's clearing the sugar away from our body.
那是因为膀胱负责清除体内的糖分。

108
00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:59.916
And then you'll see a few other hot spots,
然后你会发现其他亮点，

109
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.556
and these are in fact the tumors.
这些事实上都是肿瘤。

110
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.716
Now, this is a really a wonderful technology.
这真的是一个很棒的科技。

111
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.876
For the first time it allowed us to look into someone's body
这是第一次，我们能够观察身体内部，

112
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.276
without picking up each and every one of the cells
不需要取出细胞，

113
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.156
and putting them under the microscope,
并把它们放在显微镜下来观察，

114
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.196
but in a noninvasive way allowing us to look into someone's body
而是无侵入性地观察人体内部，

115
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.596
and ask, "Hey, has the cancer metastasized? Where is it?"
并问，“嘿，癌症有扩散吗？它在哪里？”

116
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.116
And the PET scans here are showing you very clearly
PET扫描很清晰的告诉我们

117
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.420
where are these hot spots, where is the tumor.
亮点在哪里，肿瘤在哪里。

118
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.596
So as miraculous as this might seem,
这看起来很奇妙，

119
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.500
unfortunately, well, it's not that great.
然而，这并没有那么棒。

120
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.220
You see, those small little hot spots there.
那些小小的亮点，

121
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.580
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors?
有人能猜猜在其中一个肿瘤里有多少癌细胞吗？

122
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.756
So it's about 100 million cancer cells,
大概有1亿个癌细胞，

123
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.476
and let me make sure that this number sunk in.
让我解释一下这个数字。

124
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.836
In each and every one of these small little blips
每一个小小的亮点，

125
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.436
that you're seeing on the image,
你能在图片中看到的，

126
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.556
there needs to be at least 100 million cancer cells
都需要至少1亿个癌细胞

127
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.116
in order for it to be detected.
才能被检测到。

128
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.596
Now, if that seemed to you like a very large number,
如果那对你来说是个很大的数字，

129
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.300
it is a very large number.
没错，那就是一个很大的数字。

130
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.516
This is in fact an incredibly large number,
事实上，这就是一个非常巨大的数字，

131
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.876
because what we really need in order to pick up something early enough
我们需要的是能够尽早发现一些东西，

132
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.836
to do something about it, to do something meaningful about it,
并能够采取有意义的行动，

133
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.000
well, we need to pick up tumors that are a thousand cells in size,
我们需要能发现有一千个癌细胞大小的肿瘤，

134
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.370
and ideally just a handful of cells in size.
理想来说，我们需要能发现只有很少癌细胞的肿瘤，

135
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.740
So we're clearly pretty far away from this.
所以我们很明显离这个目标还很远。

136
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.476
So we're going to play a little experiment here.
所以我们要做一个小实验。

137
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.340
I'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine that you are brain surgeons.
我要你们每一个人扮演和想象你是一个脑部手术医师。

138
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.836
And you guys are now at an operating room,
你们现在在一间手术室里，

139
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.876
and there's a patient in front of you,
面前有一个病人，

140
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.620
and your task is to make sure that the tumor is out.
你的任务就是保证清除肿瘤。

141
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.596
So you're looking down at the patient,
所以你低头看着病人，

142
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.956
the skin and the skull have already been removed,
皮肤和头骨都已经被拆除了，

143
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.516
so you're looking at the brain.
所以你正在看着大脑。

144
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.236
And all you know about this patient
你知道的所有关于这个病人的，

145
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.076
is that there's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so
就是有一个大概高尔夫球大小的肿瘤

146
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.420
in the right frontal lobe of this person's brain.
在这个病人的右额叶。

147
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.236
And that's more or less it.
情景大概就是这样。

148
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.476
So you're looking down, and unfortunately everything looks the same,
所以你往下看，不幸的是，所有东西都看起来是一样的，

149
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.596
because brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue
因为脑癌组织和健康的脑组织

150
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.196
really just look the same.
看起来是一样的。

151
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.116
And so you're going in with your thumb,
所以你要用你的拇指，

152
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.476
and you start to press a little bit on the brain,
开始轻轻地在大脑上按压，

153
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.916
because tumors tend to be a little harder, stiffer,
因为肿瘤相对更硬，

154
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.556
and so you go in and go a little bit like this and say,
所以你一遍一遍做这样的事情，

155
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.556
"It seems like the tumor is right there."
“看起来肿瘤在这。”

156
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.236
Then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor
然后你拿出刀，开始切割肿瘤，

157
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.516
piece by piece by piece.
一块一块地，

158
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.236
And as you're taking the tumor out,
当你正在摘除肿瘤的时候，

159
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.476
then you're getting to a stage where you think,
然后你会想，

160
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.636
"Alright, I'm done. I took out everything."
“好，我把所有的肿瘤都拿出来了。”

161
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.196
And at this stage, if that's --
到了这个时候，

162
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.916
so far everything sounded, like, pretty crazy --
一切看起来都有点疯狂，

163
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.636
you're now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here.
你现在要面临人生中最具挑战的决定，

164
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.196
Because now you need to decide,
因为你要决定：

165
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.916
should I stop here and let this patient go,
我应该停下，让病人出院吗？

166
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.876
risking that there might be some leftover cancer cells behind
有可能还有一些癌细胞我并没有清除掉

167
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.756
that I just couldn't see,
因为我看不出来。

168
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.436
or should I take away some extra margins,
或者我应该多摘除一些边缘组织，

169
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.316
typically about an inch or so around the tumor
比如把肿瘤边缘一英寸的区域都清除掉，

170
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.540
just to be sure that I removed everything?
以保证移除了所有肿瘤？

171
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.060
So this is not a simple decision to make,
所以这不是一个简单的决定，

172
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.596
and unfortunately this is the decision
而且不幸的是，这是一个

173
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.580
that brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day as they're seeing their patients.
脑癌手术医师每一场手术都要做的决定，

174
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.076
And so I remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab,
所以我记得我跟我的几个朋友在实验室聊天，

175
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.476
and we say, "Boy, there's got to be a better way."
我们说 “伙计们，我们必须要有更好的方式。”

176
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.916
But not just like you tell a friend that there's got to be a better way.
这不是说说而已

177
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.893
There's just got to be a better way here.
而是，真的，我们必须要有一个更好的方式。

178
00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:07.436
This is just incredible.
这太不可思议了。

179
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.116
And so we looked back.
所以我们回头看，

180
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.116
Remember those PET scans I told you about, the sugar and so on.
想起了我告诉你们的那个PET扫描，糖分子啊等等。

181
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.876
We said, hey, how about instead of using sugar molecules,
我们说，嘿，如果不用糖分子，

182
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.036
let's maybe take tiny, tiny little particles made of gold,
我们可以用很小很小的由金构成的粒子，

183
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.716
and let's program them with some interesting chemistry around them.
然后在它们旁边附上一些有趣的化学物质，

184
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.156
Let's program them to look for cancer cells.
让它们去寻找癌细胞。

185
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.276
And then we will inject these gold particles
然后我们会注射这些金粒子，

186
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.556
into these patients by the billions again,
同样以上十亿的数量注入病人体内，

187
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.556
and we'll have them go all over the body,
让它们散布全身，

188
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.556
and just like secret agents, if you will,
你可以把他们想象成秘密特工，

189
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.396
go and walk by every single cell in our body
潜伏在我们体内的每一个细胞，

190
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.116
and knock on the door of that cell,
并敲开细胞的门，

191
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.876
and ask, "Are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell?
并问：“你是一个癌细胞，还是健康的细胞？”

192
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.916
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.
如果你是一个健康的细胞，那就继续去敲下一家门，

193
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.676
If you're a cancer cell, we're sticking in and shining out
如果你是一个癌细胞，我们就潜入进去，并发出亮光，

194
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.796
and telling us, "Hey, look at me, I'm here."
给出信号说，“嘿，看看我，我在这。”

195
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.196
And they'll do it through some interesting cameras
他们可以通过一些特殊的摄像头来完成这些任务

196
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.636
that we developed in the lab.
（我们在实验室里研发出来的）

197
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.595
And once we see that, maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons
一旦我们可以看到癌细胞，我们就可以指导脑癌手术医师，

198
00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:57.020
towards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone.
只摘除肿瘤，留下健康的脑细胞。

199
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.596
And so we've tested that, and boy, this works well.
所以我们尝试了这个办法，它的运作很成功。

200
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.596
So I'm going to show you an example now.
我现在要给你们展示一个实验，

201
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.396
What you're looking at here
你现在看到的，

202
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.356
is an image of a mouse's brain,
是一张老鼠大脑的照片，

203
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.516
and we've implanted into this mouse's brain
我们已经在这只老鼠的大脑里，

204
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.796
a small little tumor.
种植了一个小肿瘤。

205
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.436
And so this tumor is now growing in this mouse's brain,
所以这个肿瘤现在正在老鼠大脑里扩散，

206
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.116
and then we've taken a doctor and asked the doctor
我们已经请求过一个医生，

207
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.956
to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient,
让他来这只“病人”老鼠动手术，

208
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.396
and take out piece by piece out of the tumor.
一片一片地取出肿瘤。

209
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.196
And while he's doing that,
当他在做这个的时候，

210
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.196
we're going to take images to see where the gold particles are.
我们准备给金粒子的位置拍照，

211
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.276
And so we're going to first start by injecting these gold particles into this mouse,
所以首先我们要给这只老鼠注射金粒子，

212
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.196
and we're going to see right here at the very left there
所以我们可以看到，在最左边，

213
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.476
that image at the bottom
底部的那张图片，

214
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.996
is the image that shows where the gold particles are.
展示金粒子的位置，

215
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.076
The nice thing is that these gold particles
金粒子的好处就是

216
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.116
actually made it all the way to the tumor,
它们能够成功找到肿瘤，

217
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.796
and then they shine out and tell us, "Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."
发光，并告诉我们“嘿，我们在这儿，肿瘤在这儿。”

218
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.196
So now we can see the tumor,
所以我们可以看到肿瘤，

219
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.356
but we're not showing this to the doctor yet.
但是我们还没有把这个展示给医生。

220
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.436
We're asking the doctor, now please start cutting away the tumor,
我们要求医生开始切除肿瘤，

221
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.876
and you'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor
你能看到四分之一的肿瘤已经被医生摘除了，

222
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.450
and you see that first quadrant is now missing.
你已经看不到四分之一的肿瘤了。

223
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.060
The doctor then took the second quadrant, the third,
医生然后移除了第二个和第三个四分之一，

224
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.356
and now it appears to be everything.
现在看起来肿瘤已经被清除干净了，

225
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.116
And so at this stage, the doctor came back to us and said,
到了这个阶段，医生告诉我们说：

226
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.396
"Alright, I'm done. What do you want me to do?
“好了，我做完了。现在你们要我干什么？

227
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.996
Should I keep things as they are
留下剩下的不动，

228
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.516
or do you want me to take some extra margins around?"
还是要我摘除多余的边缘？“

229
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.196
And then we said, "Well, hang on."
然后我们说：”等等。“

230
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.636
We told the doctor, "You've missed those two spots,
我们告诉医生“你已经遗漏了这两处，

231
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.660
so rather than taking huge margins around,
与其要切除大量的边缘，

232
00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.516
only take out those tiny little areas.
还不如把这些小型的部分切除。

233
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.556
Take them out, and then let's take a look."
把它们摘除，然后我们再看看。“

234
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.436
And so the doctor took them away, and lo and behold,
然后医生把它们摘除了，

235
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.476
the cancer is now completely gone.
癌细胞现在是完全的没了。

236
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.876
Now, the important thing
现在，重要的不仅仅是

237
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:34.220
is that it's not just that the cancer is completely gone from this person's brain, or from this mouse's brain.
癌症细胞已经从这个人或者是老鼠的大脑里摘除了，

238
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.236
The most important thing
最重要的是，

239
00:10:35.954 --> 00:10:40.680
is that we did not have to take huge amounts of healthy brain in the process.
我不需要在手术过程中摘除大量的健康脑细胞，

240
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.596
And so now we can actually imagine a world
所以现在我们可以想象一个世界，

241
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.516
where doctors and surgeons, as they take away a tumor,
医生和手术医师在摘除肿瘤的时候，

242
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.960
they actually know what to take out,
他们知道什么是应该摘除了，

243
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.100
and they no longer have to guess with their thumb.
他们不再需要用拇指来猜测。

244
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.276
Now, here's why it's extremely important to take those tiny little leftover tumors.
现在，这是为什么取出那些剩余少量的肿瘤那么重要，

245
00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:57.470
Those leftover tumors, even if it's just a handful of cells,
那些剩下的肿瘤，即使只有一点点细胞，

246
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.926
they will grow to recur the tumor,
它们会复发，

247
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.916
for the tumor to come back.
重新长成肿瘤。

248
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.876
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent
事实上，这就是为什么80%到90%的

249
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.116
of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail
脑癌手术医师最终都会失败，

250
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.916
is because of those small little extra margins that were left positive,
是因为那些我们乐观地留下少量的边缘物质，

251
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.620
those small little leftover tumors that were left there.
那些我们遗漏的没有能够清除的少量剩余物质。

252
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.436
So this is clearly very nice,
所以，这当然非常好。

253
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.756
but what I really want to share with you is where I think we're heading from here.
然而我最想分享给你们的是由此开始，我们还可以做什么

254
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.436
And so in my lab at Stanford,
在我的斯坦福实验室，

255
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.980
my students and I are asking, what should we be working on now?
我和我的学生都在想：接下来我们可以做什么？

256
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.276
And I think where medical imaging is heading to
我认为医疗影像的未来

257
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.636
is the ability to look into the human body
是能够探查人体的内部，

258
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.100
and actually see each and every one of these cells separately.
并能够分别查看每一个细胞。

259
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.476
The ability like this would allow us to actually pick up tumors way, way earlier in the process,
像这样的能力，能够让我们在早期移除肿瘤，

260
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.420
way before it's 100 million cells inside, so we can actually do something about it.
远远在达到1亿个癌细胞之前，我们就可以采取行动。

261
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.436
An ability to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us
一种能够查看单个细胞的能力，能够让我们

262
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.836
to ask insightful questions.
提出更深刻的问题。

263
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.956
So in the lab, we are now getting to a point
所以在实验室里，我们正在尝试，

264
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.236
where we can actually start asking these cancer cells real questions,
给癌细胞提出更具体的问题，

265
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.556
like, for example, are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not?
比如说，我们给你的治疗有效果吗？

266
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.144
So if you're not responding, we'll know to stop the treatment right away,
如果没有效果，我们就会知道要立即停止治疗

267
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.580
days into the treatment, not three months.
而不是要等到三个月以后

268
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.476
And so also for patients like Ehud
像埃胡德这样的病人，

269
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.916
that are going through these nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,
正在经受这些残酷治疗的病人

270
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.116
for them not to suffer through those horrendous side effects of the drugs
当药物并不能帮助他们的时候

271
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.796
when the drugs are in fact not even helping them.
让他们免受这些可怕的药物副作用，

272
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.756
So to be frank here,
但是坦白来说，

273
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.236
we're pretty far away from winning the war against cancer,
我们距离赢得与癌症的斗争还很远，

274
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.516
just to be realistic.
这就是现实。

275
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.436
But at least I am hopeful
但是，至少我是乐观的，

276
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.596
that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques
我们能够用更好的医疗影像来做斗争，

277
