11
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.722
but that's how it always goes --

you're supposed to be writing and something big happens.

17
00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.303

So I went down to see what was happening.

I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood,

I told him to get lost.

I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.

I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,

And then, the war was over.
后来，战争结束了。

66
00:03:48.392 --> 00:03:54.488
Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened."
后来我想：“不可能啊，我不可能不知道发生了什么。”

67
00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:57.973
Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me.
因为那不仅是第一回，也不仅发生在我身上。

68
00:03:57.997 --> 00:04:01.902
I have seen things like that happen to others

in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.

71
00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:10.973

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:13.903
a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years --

a real veteran -- who we would follow everywhere.

He would crawl in the dark with confidence --

he was a great soldier, a true soldier --

76
00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:26.344
so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him.

77
00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:28.676
And one day, as I was told --

As the gun went off,
枪击开始后，

83
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.225
that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table,

84
00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:47.238
like a child.

He was shaking, panicking.

He ended up working as a croupier

88
00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:58.847
in a Beirut casino where I later found him,
后来我是在一个贝鲁特赌场里找到他的，

89
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.740
because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.
因为他容易失眠，那正好是一个合适的工作。

90
00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:04.015
So I thought to myself,

It was too common to be coincidental.
这比巧合寻常多了。

96
00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.075
So I started to investigate --

that's all I know how to do.
这是我力所能及的。

going to museums, libraries, etc.

102
00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:42.143
Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this --

103
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.700
often military psychiatrists --

and that what we were dealing with was called trauma.

105
00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:54.463
Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis.

Well, it's an encounter with death.

I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death --

113
00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:15.655
I'm not talking about dead bodies,

114
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:19.280
or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed,

People used to say,

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:41.546

121
00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:47.669
But when that happens,

00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:53.369
it can remain invisible for a while --

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:56.161
days, weeks, months, sometimes years.

it explodes,
它会爆发，

126
00:07:00.717 --> 00:07:04.461
because it's something that has entered your brain --

00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:09.136
a sort of window between an image and your mind --

staying there and taking up all the space inside.

They suddenly don't want to sleep,

137
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.078

00:07:40.102 --> 00:07:42.905
For example, a soldier who enters a building

00:07:58.196 --> 00:08:00.538
later he will say, "I saw death.
