1
00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:15.305
As you heard, I'm a physicist.
就像刚才介绍的，我是一名物理学家。

2
00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.314
And I think the way we talk about physics needs a little modification.
我觉得我们需要稍微改变对物理的看法。

3
00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:22.699
I am from just down the road here; I don't live here anymore.
我就出生在本地，但我已经不住在这儿了。

4
00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:27.230
But coming from round here means that I have a northern nana,
我来自这里，意味着我有一个北方外婆，

5
00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:28.421
my mum's mom.
即我母亲的母亲。

6
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.472
And Nana is very bright; she hasn't had much formal education,
外婆非常睿智，她没有接受过多少正规教育，

7
00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:33.664
but she's sharp.
但她很聪明。

8
00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:37.766
And when I was a second-year undergraduate studying physics at Cambridge,
我在剑桥物理系念大二时，

9
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.633
I remember spending an afternoon at Nana's house in Urmston
记得有一个下午，我在厄姆斯顿的外婆家，

10
00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:44.039
studying quantum mechanics.
学习量子力学。

11
00:00:43.783 --> 00:00:46.404
And I had these folders open in front of me
我打开了资料夹，

12
00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.276
with this, you know, hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.
老实讲，资料中的文字晦涩难懂。

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.004
And Nana came along, and she looked at this folder,
这时，外婆走进来，看到我面前的资料。

14
00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:55.619
and she said, "What's that?"
她问：“这是什么？”

15
00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:58.999
I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana."
我说：“外婆，这是量子力学。”

16
00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:03.829
And I tried to explain something about what was on the page.
然后，我试着去解释那是什么，解释书上讲的内容，

17
00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:07.842
It was to do with the nucleus and Einstein A and B coefficients.
关于原子核，还有爱因斯坦A、B系数的内容。

18
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.656
And Nana looked very impressed.
外婆看上去很惊讶，

19
00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:14.873
And then she said, "Oh. What can you do when you know that?"
然后她说，“哦，那你知道了这些后能做些什么呀？”

20
00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:16.897
(Laughter)
（笑声）

21
00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.544
"Don't know, ma'am."
“我也不知道啊。”

22
00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:21.632
(Laughter)
（笑声）

23
00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.656
I think I said something about computers,
我想当时我说了些跟电脑有关的事情，

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.758
because it was all I could think of at the time.
因为这是当时我唯一能想到的用途。

25
00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:30.426
But you can broaden that question out, because it's a very good question --
不过你可以把那个问题延伸开来，其实是一个很棒的问题。

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.352
"What can you do when you know that?" when "that" is physics?
“当你了解物理知识后，你能做些什么？”

27
00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:36.844
And I've come to realize that when we talk about physics in society
然后我意识到，当我们在社会中谈起物理、

28
00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.270
and our sort of image of it,
以及我们对它的看法时，

29
00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.446
we don't include the things that we can do when we know that.
我们并没有把“学到知识后能做些什么”考虑在内，

30
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.183
Our perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift.
我们需要稍微转变对物理的看法，

31
00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:46.111
Not only does it need a bit of a shift,
不仅仅是稍微转变一下，

32
00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:51.691
but sharing this different perspective matters for our society,
更重要的是，要向社会传播这种不同的观点。

33
00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:54.923
and I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist and I'm biased
我这样说并非出于一个物理学家的偏见，

34
00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:57.714
and I think we're the most important people in the world.
或者觉得我们是世界上最重要的人，

35
00:01:56.524 --> 00:01:57.559
Honest.
实话实说。

36
00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.975
So, the image of physics -- we've got an image problem, let's be honest --
坦白讲，我们对物理的看法存在着一些问题，

37
00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:04.453
it hasn't moved on much from this.
而且一直以来并没有什么大的改观。

38
00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:08.549
This is a very famous photograph that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.
这张著名的照片拍摄于1927年的索尔维会议，

39
00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:15.088
This is when the great minds of physics were grappling with the nature of determinism
当时物理学大师们正合力解决决定论的本质问题，

40
00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.132
and what it means only to have a probability
试图搞清一个粒子可能出现在某个地方的概率

41
00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.927
that a particle might be somewhere,
到底意味着什么，

42
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.533
and whether any of it was real.
以及这是不是真实的。

43
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.024
And it was all very difficult.
这些都是很难解决的问题。

44
00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:25.005
And you'll notice they're all very stern-looking men in suits.
你们也许会注意到，他们都是西装革履，不苟言笑的男人。

45
00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:27.945
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying, "Marie Antoinette,"
玛丽· 居里，我经常会说成 ”玛丽· 安托瓦内特”（被送上断头台的法国王后），

46
00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.933
which would be a turn-up for the books --
那历史可就要改写了——

47
00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:32.553
Marie Curie, third from the left on the bottom there,
玛丽· 居里在最前面一排的左数第三位，

48
00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:35.292
she was allowed in, but had to dress like everybody else.
她获准参加会议，但必须和其他人着装一致。

49
00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:35.481
(Laughter)
（笑声）

50
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:40.205
So, this is what physics is like -- there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,
这就是人们对物理的印象，——所有的一切都晦涩难懂，

51
00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.452
these are to do with waves and particles.
讲的都是与波和粒子有关的事情。

52
00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:45.656
That is an artist's impression of two black holes colliding,
这张图片是以艺术家视角展现的两个碰撞的黑洞，

53
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.968
which makes it look worth watching, to be honest.
老实讲，这让它看上去有了观赏价值，

54
00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:51.940
I'm glad I didn't have to write the risk assessment for whatever was going on there.
庆幸的是——我不必为那里发生的事情写一篇风险评估报告。

55
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.231
The point is: this is the image of physics, right?
我想说的是，这就是物理通常给人的印象，对吧？

56
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:53.530
It's weird and difficult,
很古怪，而且很难，

57
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.952
done by slightly strange people dressed in a slightly strange way.
研究物理的都是一帮着装怪异的怪人们，

58
00:02:56.952 --> 00:02:58.963
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else
它遥不可及、离我们很远，

59
00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:02.547
and fundamentally, why should I care?
说到底，我干嘛要关心这些呢？

60
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.339
And the problem with that is that I'm a physicist,
问题在于，我是一名物理学家，

61
00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.826
and I study this.
我研究这个。

62
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.146
This -- this is my job, right?
这就是我的工作，

63
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.870
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.
我研究大气与海洋的交界面，

64
00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.182
The atmosphere is massive, the ocean is massive,
大气是广袤的，海洋也一望无际，

65
00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:18.507
and the thin layer that joins them together
它们之间存在一个薄层，将二者相连，

66
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:19.523
is really important,
这个薄层非常重要，

67
00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:23.228
because that's where things go from one huge reservoir to the other.
经由这个薄层，物质才能在巨大的容器间传递。

68
00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:27.472
You can see that the sea surface -- that was me who took this video --
你能看到海面——这是我拍摄的视频——

69
00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:30.631
the average height of those waves by the way, was 10 meters.
那些海浪平均高达10米。

70
00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:33.150
So this is definitely physics happening here --
这个过程绝对存在着物理原理——

71
00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:35.722
there's lots of things -- this is definitely physics.
很多事情正在发生——是绝对的物理现象。

72
00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:39.296
And yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics,
然而，我们对物理的认知中并没有包括这些。

73
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.146
and that bothers me.
这让我很困扰。

74
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.528
So what is included in our cultural perception of physics?
通常我们对物理的认知包括哪些呢？

75
00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:47.332
Because I'm a physicist, there has to be a graph, right?
我是个物理学家，所以就离不开用图表说话，对吧？

76
00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:48.512
That's allowed.
合情合理！

77
00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:52.867
We've got time along the bottom here, from very fast things there,
底部横轴代表时间，

78
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:56.262
to things that take a long time over here.
左侧是快速发生的事情，最右边的则需要比较长的时间；

79
00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.781
Small things at the bottom, big things up there.
小东西在纵轴底部，大家伙在最上面，

80
00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.830
So, our current cultural image of physics looks like this.
我们对物理的文化认识大致如此。

81
00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:04.375
There's quantum mechanics down in that corner,
最左下角是量子力学，

82
00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.399
it's very small, it's very weird,
非常小、非常难以捉摸，

83
00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:08.424
it happens very quickly,
它发生的速度很快，

84
00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.729
and it's a long way down in the general ...
总体来说，量子力学在坐标轴最下方......

85
00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:14.587
on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life.
与我们日常生活事物相比较而言的话。

86
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:16.943
And then there's cosmology, which is up there;
然后就是宇宙，就在右上角那里。

87
00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:18.278
very large, very far away,
它非常大、非常遥远，

88
00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:20.332
also very weird.
也非常诡异。

89
00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.326
And if you go to some places
如果你在宇宙形成之初去了一些地方，

90
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.414
like black holes in the beginning of the universe,
比如黑洞，它们就交织在宇宙背后，

91
00:04:25.438 --> 00:04:28.440
we know that these are frontiers in physics, right?
我们都知道这些是物理学的前沿，对吧？

92
00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:32.669
There's lots of work being done to discover new physics in these places.
要做很多工作，才能在这些地方发现新的物理学。

93
00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:36.654
But the thing is, you will notice there's a very large gap in the middle.
但问题是，你会注意到中间缺少了一大块，

94
00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:38.836
And in that gap, there are many things.
在这缺少的一大块中，有非常多的东西。

95
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.503
There are planets and toasts and volcanoes and clouds
其中有行星、吐司、火山、云彩，

96
00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:43.664
and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins
有单簧管、气泡和海豚，

97
00:04:43.688 --> 00:04:46.947
and all sorts of things that make up our everyday life.
各种各样组成我们日常生活的东西。

98
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.084
And these are also run by physics, you'd be surprised --
你可能会惊讶的是，这些也是由物理学支撑的，

99
00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:53.407
there is physics in the middle, it's just that nobody talks about it.
中间的部分也有物理学存在，只是没人谈论它而已。

100
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.402
And the thing about all of these is that they all run
所有这一切的一切，

101
00:04:56.516 --> 00:05:00.951
on a relatively small number of physical laws,
它们的运转都遵循着一小部分的物理定律，

102
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:02.859
things like Newton's laws of motion,
例如牛顿的运动定律、

103
00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:04.046
thermodynamics,
热力学、

104
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.785
some rotational dynamics.
一些旋转动力学。

105
00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:09.337
The physics in the middle applies over a huge range,
中间这部分涉及到的物理学范围极其广泛，

106
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:11.982
from very, very small things to very, very big things.
从很小的事物，到很大的现象。

107
00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:14.314
You have to try very hard to get outside of this.
你很难脱离开这个领域。

108
00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:18.205
And there is also a frontier in research physics here,
这里也有前沿的研究物理学，

109
00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.032
it's just that nobody talks about it.
只是没人会谈论它。

110
00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.347
This is the world of the complex.
这是一个复杂的世界。

111
00:05:21.757 --> 00:05:23.239
When these laws work together, 
当这些原理协同作用时，

112
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.858
they bring about the beautiful, messy, complex world we live in.
就产生了我们所居住的美妙、混乱和复杂的世界。

113
00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:31.769
Fundamentally, this is the bit that really matters to me on an everyday basis.
从根本上讲，这才是基于日常生活，对我意义重大的那部分，

114
00:05:31.793 --> 00:05:33.972
And this is the bit that we don't talk about.
也是我们没有谈论的部分。

115
00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:36.330
There's plenty of physics research going on here.
这里包含了大量的物理研究，

116
00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:38.342
But because it doesn't involve pointing at stars,
但是由于它不涉及天文学观测，

117
00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:40.834
people for some reason think it's not that.
人们出于某种原因，认为这里不涉及物理学。

118
00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:46.364
Now, the cool thing about this is that there are so many things in this middle bit,
但真正有趣的是，中间领域包含了许多事物，

119
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.222
all following the same physical laws,
都遵从同样的物理定律，

120
00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:51.571
that we can see those laws at work
我们能看到这些定律

121
00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.595
almost all the time around us.
在我们身边一直作用着。

122
00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:54.138
I've got a little video here.
我这里有一段视频：

123
00:05:54.138 --> 00:05:58.915
So the game is, one of these eggs is raw and one of them has been boiled.
其中一个鸡蛋是生的，另一个是煮熟的，

124
00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:01.045
I want you to tell me which one is which.
我希望你能区分出它们。

125
00:06:02.553 --> 00:06:04.335
Which one's raw?
哪一个是生鸡蛋？

126
00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:05.505
(Audience responds)
（观众回应）

127
00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.003
The one on the left -- yes!
左边这个？回答正确！

128
00:06:06.957 --> 00:06:09.301
And even though you might not have tried that, you all knew.
即使你没试过，也都知道答案。

129
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.441
The reason for that is, you set them spinning,
原因在于，当你把它们转动起来，

130
00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:15.648
and when you stop the cooked egg, the one that's completely solid,
再用手停住煮熟的鸡蛋时，因为它已全部成为固体，

131
00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:16.824
you stop the entire egg.
你就停住了整只鸡蛋。

132
00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:19.411
When you stop the other one, you only stop the shell;
当你停住另一只鸡蛋时，你只是停住了鸡蛋壳，

133
00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:22.781
the liquid inside is still rotating because nothing's made it stop.
里面的液体仍在旋转，因为没有力量去停止它。

134
00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:27.087
And then it pushes the shell round again, so the egg starts to rotate again.
之后它会带动蛋壳再次旋转，因此，鸡蛋再次转动起来。

135
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.137
This is brilliant, right?
很奇妙，不是么？

136
00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:31.442
It's a demonstration of something in physics
这证明了物理学的一些东西，

137
00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:34.812
that we call the law of conservation of angular momentum,
就是我们所说的动量守恒定律，

138
00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:38.737
which basically says that if you set something spinning about a fixed axis,
它讲的是，如果你让什么东西沿固定轴转动，

139
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:41.856
that it will keep spinning unless you do something to stop it.
它会一直旋转，直到有外力迫使它停下。

140
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.060
And that's really fundamental in how the universe works.
而这正是宇宙运转的基础。

141
00:06:44.974 --> 00:06:47.578
And it's not just eggs that it applies to,
并非只有鸡蛋遵从这个规律，

142
00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.520
although it's really useful if you're the sort of person --
虽然这很有用，如果你是这样的人——

143
00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.487
and apparently, these people do exist --
显然这样的人确实存在——

144
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.298
who will boil eggs and then put them back in the fridge.
他们把鸡蛋煮熟，然后再放回到冰箱。

145
00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:57.407
Who does that? Don't admit to it -- it's OK. We won't judge you.
谁会这样做？别急着承认——没关系，没人会品头论足。

146
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.520
But it's also got much broader applicabilities.
但物理也有更广泛的应用性。

147
00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:03.516
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.
这是哈勃太空望远镜、

148
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.732
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is a very tiny part of the sky.
哈勃超深场，它只观测太空很小的一部分。

149
00:07:06.756 --> 00:07:09.877
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years,
哈勃望远镜已漂浮在太空中25年，

150
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.469
not touching anything.
还没撞到过什么东西，

151
00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:14.199
And yet it can point to a tiny region of sky.
它可以指向一小片区域，

152
00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:18.525
For 11 and a half days, it did it in sections,
一张张地拍照，历时11.5天，

153
00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:21.203
accurately enough to take amazing images like this.
就足够精确地拍摄出像这样的精美图片。

154
00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:22.386
So the question is:
那么问题在于，

155
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.508
How does something that is not touching anything
一个物体如何才能不碰到其他东西？

156
00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:26.009
know where it is?
如何知道自己所处的位置？

157
00:07:25.963 --> 00:07:28.728
The answer is that right in the middle of it, it has something
答案是，就在中间的这片区域中，

158
00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:30.803
that, to my great disappointment, isn't a raw egg,
让我极度失望的是，存在的东西不是生鸡蛋，

159
00:07:30.803 --> 00:07:32.656
but basically does the same job.
但基本原理与其相似。

160
00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:34.855
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,
它有正在旋转的陀螺仪，

161
00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.683
and because of the law of conservation of angular momentum,
根据动量守恒定律，

162
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.281
they keep spinning with the same axis, indefinitely.
它们以同一个轴为中心，保持旋转、永不停息。

163
00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:43.394
Hubble kind of rotates around them, and so it can orient itself.
哈勃望远镜像是在围绕其运动，因此它可以为自己导向。

164
00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:47.562
So the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use,
我们可以在厨房应用同样的物理小定律，

165
00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:53.914
also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time.
这也解释了为什么我们这个时代产生了如此多的高新科技。

166
00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:57.545
So this is the fun bit of physics, that you learn these patterns
这就是物理有趣的地方，你了解了这些模式，

167
00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.130
and then you can apply them again and again and again.
然后就可以一次又次地应用它们。

168
00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:03.030
And it's really rewarding when you spot them in new places.
当你发现它们应用在新领域时，会觉得非常有成就感。

169
00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:04.627
This is the fun of physics.
这就是物理的乐趣所在。

170
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:09.025
I have shown that egg video to an audience full of businesspeople once
我曾经将鸡蛋视频展示给一些来自商业领域的人们，

171
00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:13.653
and they were all dressed up very smartly and trying to impress their bosses.
他们都西装笔挺，试图给老板留下好印象。

172
00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:17.502
And I was running out of time, so I showed the egg video and then said,
当时我的演讲时间不多了，就播放了刚才的鸡蛋视频，

173
00:08:16.926 --> 00:08:20.180
"Well, you can work it out, and ask me afterwards to check."
说道：“你们可以想想，然后跟我确认是否正确”。

174
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.567
Then I left the stage.
然后我就离开了讲台。

175
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:22.744
And I had, literally,
稍后，毫不夸张地说，

176
00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.345
middle-aged grown men tugging on my sleeve afterwards,
这些中年人后来拉着我的衣袖问：

177
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.149
saying, "Is it this? Is it this?"
“是不是这个？是不是这个呀？”

178
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:28.047
And when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!"
当我回答“是”的时候，他们激动地喊出“噢耶！”

179
00:08:28.047 --> 00:08:28.817
(Laughter)
（笑声）

180
00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:32.493
The joy that you get from spotting these patterns
发现这些规律的乐趣，

181
00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:34.700
doesn't go away when you're an adult.
不会因为你的成年而消失。

182
00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.479
And that's really important,
这一点尤为重要，

183
00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:38.982
because physics is all about patterns,
因为物理全部在于规律，

184
00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:45.143
and a small number of patterns give you access to almost all of the physics in our everyday world.
这些为数不多的规律，能够让你接触到日常生活中的所有物理知识，

185
00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:48.738
The thing that's best about this is it involves playing with toys.
最棒的是，它和玩玩具有关。

186
00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:52.253
Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed as the mundane little things
像鸡蛋这样的东西，不应当被视为无聊小物而被忽视，

187
00:08:51.707 --> 00:08:54.447
that we just give the kids to play with on a Saturday afternoon
我们可以在周六下午拿这种东西给孩子玩，

188
00:08:54.447 --> 00:08:55.666
to keep them quiet.
让他们安静一会儿。

189
00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:57.882
This is the stuff that actually really matters,
实际上，这才是真正重要的东西，

190
00:08:57.882 --> 00:09:01.294
because this is the laws of the universe and it applies to eggs
因为这就是宇宙定律应用在鸡蛋上，

191
00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:05.183
and toast falling butter-side down and all sorts of other things,
面包片抹了黄油的那面会先着地，当然还有其它类似的现象。

192
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:07.575
just as much as it applies to modern technology
这些现象与现代科技运用的原理相同，

193
00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:09.878
and anything else that's going on in the world.
世界上其他现象也是如此。

194
00:09:09.902 --> 00:09:13.616
So I think we should play with these patterns.
因此我认为，我们应该学会玩转这些规律，

195
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.855
Basically, there are a small number of concepts
基本上来说，当你使用厨房里的工具时，

196
00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:18.884
that you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen,
会对一小部分概念熟悉起来，

197
00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:21.673
that are really useful for life in the outside world.
在外界的生活中，这些概念也同样适用。

198
00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:25.254
If you want to learn about thermodynamics, a duck is a good place to start,
如果你想学习热动力学，鸭子就是一个不错的开始。

199
00:09:24.978 --> 00:09:27.284
for example, why their feet don't get cold.
譬如，为何它们的脚蹼从来不会变凉？

200
00:09:27.354 --> 00:09:29.905
Once you've got a bit of thermodynamics with the duck,
一旦你从鸭子身上弄懂了一点热动力学，

201
00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:31.348
you can also explain fridges.
你就可以解释冰箱的工作原理。

202
00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:34.183
Magnets that you can play with in your kitchen
你在厨房使用的磁铁，

203
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.197
get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation.
会让你学到风力涡轮机和现代能源产生的原理。

204
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:41.265
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always a good thing to play with.
再比如苏打柠檬水里的葡萄干，也是经常可以把玩的东西。

205
00:09:40.555 --> 00:09:44.382
If you're at a boring party, fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,
如果你在派对上很无聊，可以从零食上取下点葡萄干，

206
00:09:44.592 --> 00:09:46.592
put them in some lemonade.
把它们放到柠檬水里，

207
00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:48.203
It's got three consequences.
会得到三种结果：

208
00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:50.594
First thing is, it's quite good to watch; try it.
第一，它的观赏性很好，不妨试试看；

209
00:09:50.618 --> 00:09:53.133
Secondly, it sends the boring people away.
第二，它把无聊的人赶跑了；

210
00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:55.520
Thirdly, it brings the interesting people to you.
第三，它会把有趣的人吸引过来！

211
00:09:55.544 --> 00:09:56.907
You win on all fronts.
一箭三雕！

212
00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:00.278
And then there's spin and gas laws and viscosity.
还有旋转和气体定律以及粘滞性，

213
00:10:00.302 --> 00:10:03.794
There's these little patterns, and they're right around us everywhere.
这些都是我们身边无处不在的小规律。

214
00:10:03.818 --> 00:10:07.379
And it's fundamentally democratic, right?
这些基本上人人可见，

215
00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:11.055
Everybody has access to the same physics; you don't need a big, posh lab.
人人都能接触到同样的物理学，不是只有光鲜的实验室里才会有。

216
00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:15.033
When I wrote the book, I had the chapter on spin.
当我写这本书的时候，有一章是专门讲旋转的，

217
00:10:15.057 --> 00:10:17.739
I had written a bit about toast falling butter-side down.
我写了一点点关于面包片抹了黄油那面先着地，

218
00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:20.835
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine who's not a scientist,
然后把这一章给一位非科学家朋友看，

219
00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:22.973
for him to read and tell me what he thought,
让他告诉我读后感。

220
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.075
and he took the chapter away.
他把这一章拿走了，

221
00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:27.308
He was working overseas.
他在海外工作，

222
00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:30.309
I got this text message back from him a couple of weeks later,
几周之后我才收到他的来信。

223
00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:34.542
and it said, "I'm at breakfast in a posh hotel in Switzerland,
信里写道：“我正在瑞士的一家时尚酒店吃早餐，

224
00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:37.298
and I really want to push toast off the table,
我很想把面包片推下桌子，

225
00:10:37.322 --> 00:10:39.864
because I don't believe what you wrote."
因为我不相信你写的内容！“

226
00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:42.203
And that was the good bit -- he doesn't have to.
这正是好玩的地方——他根本没必要相信我，

227
00:10:42.227 --> 00:10:45.683
He can push the toast off the table and try it for himself.
只需把面包片推下桌子，自己试试就好啦！

228
00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:49.544
And so there's two important things to know about science:
因此，关于科学有两件事非常重要：

229
00:10:49.568 --> 00:10:55.060
the fundamental laws we've learned through experience and experimentation, work.
我们通过经验和实验得到的基本法则是成立的。

230
00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:57.066
The day we drop an apple and it goes up,
如果我们某天扔出苹果后，苹果向上走，

231
00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:58.396
then we'll have a debate about gravity.
那我们就要好好辩论一下重力作用了。

232
00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:00.980
Up to that point, we basically know how gravity works,
那一刻，我们基本上已了解重力的作用原理，

233
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.138
and we can learn the framework.
我们可以了解其框架；

234
00:11:03.202 --> 00:11:05.489
Then there's the process of experimentation:
接下来就是实验过程了：

235
00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:07.636
having confidence in things, trying things out,
对某个事情有信心，对事情进行验证，

236
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.209
critical thinking -- how we move science forward --
并进行批判性思维——我们如何推动科学向前——

237
00:11:10.233 --> 00:11:15.352
and you can learn both of those things by playing with toys in the everyday world.
而且，你还可以通过日常生活中的玩具来学习这两方面的技能。

238
00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.523
And it's really important,
这一点十分重要，

239
00:11:17.547 --> 00:11:19.762
because there's all this talk about technology,
因为我们本次讲的技术、

240
00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:21.787
we've heard talks about quantum computing
听说过的量子计算、

241
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:23.812
and all these mysterious, far-off things.
还有其他神秘的、离我们很远的东西。

242
00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:27.670
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies that are about this size,
但究其根本，我们依然生活在这么大的身体中，

243
00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:30.631
we still walk about, sit on chairs that are about this size,
我们依然走来走去，坐在这么大的椅子上，

244
00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.655
we still live in the physical world.
我们仍然生活在物理世界中。

245
00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:36.627
And being familiar with these concepts means we're not helpless.
熟悉这些概念意味着我们不会有无助感，

246
00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:39.502
And I think it's really important that we're not helpless,
而且，我认为没有无助感是非常重要的，

247
00:11:39.526 --> 00:11:41.734
that society feels it can look at things,
社会觉得能够思考是非常重要的，

248
00:11:41.758 --> 00:11:44.424
because this isn't about knowing all the answers.
因为它是关于要了解所有的答案，

249
00:11:44.448 --> 00:11:47.865
It's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions.
而是在于你了解了框架后，可以正确地提出问题。

250
00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:51.403
And by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life,
通过把玩这些日常生活中基本的小东西，

251
00:11:50.713 --> 00:11:54.026
we gain the confidence to ask the right questions.
我们会拥有正确提问的信心。

252
00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:55.872
So, there's a bigger thing.
还有一件更重要的事要说。

253
00:11:55.896 --> 00:11:57.270
In answer to Nana's question
在回答奶奶的问题

254
00:11:57.294 --> 00:11:59.304
about what can you do when you know that --
“当你了解这些后，你能够做些什么”——

255
00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:01.781
because there's lots of stuff in the everyday world
因为在你了解这些物理规律后，

256
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.502
that you can do when you know that,
在日常世界中就可以做很多事情，

257
00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:04.920
especially if you've got eggs in the fridge --
尤其是如果你冰箱有鸡蛋的时候——

258
00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:08.326
there's a much deeper answer.
而这个问题现在有了更深刻的答案。

259
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.514
And so there's all the fun and the curiosity
当你玩玩具时，

260
00:12:10.538 --> 00:12:12.500
that you could have playing with toys.
会获得极大乐趣，还有好奇心，

261
00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:16.072
By the way -- why should kids have all the fun, right?
顺便说一句——为何只有孩子能玩乐呢？

262
00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:18.096
All of us can have fun playing with toys,
我们大家都可以通过玩玩具来获得乐趣，

263
00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:19.090
and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
而且我们不应对此感到难为情。

264
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.152
You can blame me, it's fine.
没关系，你可以把责任推到我头上。

265
00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:27.455
So when it comes to reasons for studying physics, for example,
比如，说到学习物理的原因，

266
00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:30.370
here is the best reason I can think of:
我能想到的最好的原因就是：

267
00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:34.226
I think that each of us has three life-support systems.
我认为每个人都有三个支撑我们生活的系统，

268
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.607
We've got our own body, we've got a planet
即我们的身体、我们的星球、

269
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.398
and we've got our civilization.
和我们的文明。

270
00:12:38.422 --> 00:12:41.461
Each of those is an independent life-support system,
每一个都是独立的生活支撑系统，

271
00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:43.485
keeping us alive in its own way.
以其独特的方式维持着我们的生存；

272
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:46.676
And they all run on the fundamental physical laws
它们都遵循基本的物理定律运行着，

273
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.100
that you can learn in the kitchen with eggs and teacups and lemonade,
你可以在厨房用鸡蛋、茶杯和柠檬水学到这些定律，

274
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.553
and everything else you can play with.
也可以通过其它任何能玩的东西学到。

275
00:12:51.553 --> 00:12:53.318
This is the reason, for example,
这就是为什么说

276
00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:56.557
why something like climate change is such a serious problem,
像气候变化类的事情是一个严峻的问题的原因，

277
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:59.113
because It's two of these life-support systems,
因为它影响到两个生命支持系统：

278
00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:00.905
our planet and our civilization,
我们的星球和我们的文明，

279
00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:02.884
kind of butting up against each other;
使二者互相碰撞；

280
00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:05.800
they're in conflict, and we need to negotiate that boundary.
它们之间出现冲突，这就需要我们去确定界限。

281
00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:10.544
And the fundamental physical laws that we can learn that are the way the world around us works,
我们能够学到的、周围世界的运转方式的最基本物理定律，

282
00:13:10.568 --> 00:13:12.988
are the tools at the basis of everything;
就是基于万物的工具，

283
00:13:13.012 --> 00:13:14.374
they're the foundation.
它们才是根基所在。

284
00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:16.569
There's lots of things to know about in life,
生活中需要了解的东西很多，

285
00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.659
but knowing the foundations is going to get you a long way.
但了解了根本，才会让你走得更远。

286
00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:23.134
And I think this, if you're not interested in having fun with physics
我认为，如果你对物理或类似事情带来的乐趣毫无兴趣，

287
00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:27.129
or anything like that -- strange, but apparently, these people exist --
——虽然奇怪，但很显然，这样的人确实存在——

288
00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:31.240
you surely are interested in keeping yourself alive
你肯定会对自己如何生存、

289
00:13:31.264 --> 00:13:33.315
and in how our life-support systems work.
我们的生命支持系统如何运转感兴趣。

290
00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:38.114
The framework for physics is remarkably constant;
物理学的框架非常稳定，

291
00:13:38.138 --> 00:13:40.814
it's the same in lots and lots of things that we measure.
它和我们所测量的大量事物一样是恒定的，

292
00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:42.676
It's not going to change anytime soon.
并且短时间内也不会改变，

293
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.963
They might discover some new quantum mechanics,
他们可能会发现一些新的量子力学，

294
00:13:44.987 --> 00:13:47.643
but apples right here are still going to fall down.
但这里的苹果依然会下落。

295
00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:49.790
So, the question is --
这样，问题就来了——

296
00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:52.103
I get asked sometimes: How do you start?
时常有人问我：你是怎么开始的？

297
00:13:52.127 --> 00:13:53.348
What's the place to start
“从哪儿学起呀，

298
00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:56.628
if you're interested in the physical world, in not being helpless,
如果你对物理世界感兴趣、对不感到无助有兴趣、

299
00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:58.489
and in finding some toys to play with?
对玩玩具有兴趣的话？”

300
00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:00.917
Here is my suggestion to you:
以下就是我的建议：

301
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:06.340
the place to start is that moment -- and adults do this --
开始的地方就是起点——成年人这么做——

302
00:14:06.364 --> 00:14:08.226
you're drifting along somewhere,
不经意间，你在某个地方

303
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.841
and you spot something and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird."
你发现了某个东西，大脑会反应“哦，这个好奇怪”，

304
00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:15.489
And then your consciousness goes, "You're an adult. Keep going."
然后你的潜意识会说，“你是个成年人了，别管它”。

305
00:14:15.513 --> 00:14:18.352
And that's the point -- hold that thought --
这就是关键所在——要抓住此时的想法——

306
00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:21.004
that bit where your brain went, "Oh, that's a bit odd,"
就是当大脑告诉你 “哦，这有点怪”的想法，

307
00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.321
because there's something there to play with,
因为这是你可以把玩的东西，

308
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:23.643
and it's worth you playing with it,
并且值得你去钻研，

309
00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:24.987
so that's the place to start.
这就是你要开始的地方。

310
00:14:24.987 --> 00:14:27.957
But if you don't have any of those little moments
但如果在你参加完这个活动后，

311
00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:30.227
on your way home from this event,
回家的路上并没有这种小瞬间，

312
00:14:30.277 --> 00:14:31.962
here are some things to start with.
你也可以从以下的事情着手。

313
00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:34.148
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade; highly entertaining.
放点葡萄干在柠檬水里，这非常有意思；

314
00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.172
Watch a coffee spill dry.
观察洒出来的咖啡是如何干透的，

315
00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:38.800
I know that sounds a little bit like watching paint dry,
我知道这听起来有点像看着油漆干透，

316
00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:42.289
but it does do quite weird things; it's worth watching.
但确实会有奇怪的现象，非常值得观察。

317
00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:46.508
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around.
我渐渐喜欢上晚宴，如果周围有茶杯的话。

318
00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:49.972
There are so many things you can do to play with teacups, it's brilliant.
你可以用茶杯玩出很多花样，超级棒。

319
00:14:49.996 --> 00:14:53.405
The most obvious one is to get a teacup, get a spoon,
最棒的一个是，你拿一个茶杯和一个小勺，

320
00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:55.747
tap the teacup around the rim and listen,
用勺子轻敲茶杯边缘，然后仔细聆听，

321
00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:57.566
and you will hear something strange.
你就会听到奇怪的声音。

322
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.890
And the other thing is, push your toast off the table
另一个可以玩的是把面包片推下桌子，

323
00:15:00.914 --> 00:15:03.323
because you can, and you'll learn stuff from it.
因为你能、而且也会从中学到东西。

324
00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.299
And if you're feeling really ambitious,
如果你还是觉得不过瘾，

325
00:15:05.323 --> 00:15:09.450
try and push it off in such a way that it doesn't fall butter-side down,
试试如何避免让抹黄油那面着地，

326
00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.030
which is possible.
这也是可能的呦。

327
00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:13.756
The point of all of this is that,
这一切的重点在于：

328
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.873
first of all, we should all play with toys.
首先，我们都应该把玩一些东西。

329
00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:19.321
We shouldn't be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves
我们不应该惧怕利用周围的工具

330
00:15:18.811 --> 00:15:20.179
with the tools around us,
来探索自己的物理世界，

331
00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:22.399
because we all have access to them.
因为它们唾手可得。

332
00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:25.042
It matters, because if we want to understand society,
这一点非常重要，因为如果我们想了解社会、

333
00:15:24.972 --> 00:15:26.419
if we want to be good citizens,
想做优秀公民的话，

334
00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:30.727
we need to understand the framework on which everything else must be based.
我们就需要了解生活中的一切所基于的框架，

335
00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:32.770
Playing with toys is great.
玩玩具就非常好，

336
00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:35.907
Understanding how to keep our life-support systems going is great.
了解我们的生命支持系统是如何运转的也很棒，

337
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:40.176
But fundamentally, the thing that we need to change in the way that we talk about physics,
但根本上，我们需要改变谈论物理的方式是，

338
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.683
is we need to understand that physics isn't out there with weird people
我们需要明白物理不是那些怪人们的专利，

339
00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:46.849
and strange hieroglyphics for somebody else in a posh lab.
不是专供在华丽实验室的人们阅读的奇怪而晦涩的文字。

340
00:15:46.873 --> 00:15:49.923
Physics is right here; it's for us, and we can all play with it.
物理就在这里，它是所有人的，我们都可以与它互动。

341
00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:51.113
Thank you very much.
非常感谢！

342
00:15:51.137 --> 00:15:53.137
(Applause)
