throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room

28
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.156

are committed by repeat offenders.
都是由累犯犯下的。

much less anything happen if they are.

这意味着，在美国他们将有 百分之九十九的可能逃之夭夭 。

in the United States.

I'm interested in systems and networks

因此在我看来，性侵是一个 无比悲痛，但却是一个可以解决的问题。

42
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.236
So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago,

with the ability to report their assault
