1
00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:16.708
OK, first, some introductions.
大家好。首先，我想先介绍一下我的家庭。

2
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.962
My mom, Jennie, took this picture.
这张照片是我母亲珍妮拍的。

3
00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:23.317
That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.
照片正中的是我父亲，弗兰克。

4
00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:26.103
And on his left, my sisters:
在他的左侧的是我的姐妹：

5
00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:30.611
Mary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie.
玛丽·凯瑟琳，朱迪·安，特蕾莎·玛瑞。

6
00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:34.559
John Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin Michael's on his right.
被他抱在膝上的是约翰·帕特里克，而坐在父亲右侧的是凯文·迈克尔。

7
00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.032
And in the pale-blue windbreaker,
而那个穿着浅蓝色冲锋衣的小孩

8
00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:40.201
Susan Diane. Me.
就是我，苏珊·黛安。

9
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:44.439
I loved growing up in a big family.
在这样一个大家庭里成长是非常幸福的。

10
00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.652
And one of my favorite things was picking names.
小时候我的爱好之一就是帮忙取名字。

11
00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:53.189
But by the time child number seven came along,
但当家中迎来第七个孩子时，

12
00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:55.530
we had nearly run out of middle names.
我们能用的中间名已经基本上全用过了。

13
00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:58.737
It was a long deliberation
最后全家经过几番讨论后决定，

14
00:01:00.307 --> 00:01:02.768
before we finally settled on Jennifer Bridget.
我的小妹妹的名字为詹妮弗·布丽奇特。

15
00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:06.904
Every parent in this audience
在座的各位中一定有已经为人父母的，

16
00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:12.014
knows the joy and excitement of picking a new baby's name.
你们一定了解在新生儿诞生之初为它取名时的激动和喜悦。

17
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.655
And I was excited and thrilled
而我在那重要的纪念性时刻

18
00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.382
to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment.
协助母亲的时候感到激动不已。

19
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:21.683
But it's not like that everywhere.
但并不是所有家庭都能如此幸福。

20
00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.666
I travel a lot and I see a lot.
我四处游历，也见闻颇丰。

21
00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:31.389
But it took me by surprise to learn in an area of Ethiopia,
但是在埃塞俄比亚的所见所闻还是让我感到非常意外。

22
00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:35.094
parents delay picking the names for their new babies
那里的父母会推迟给新生儿取名

23
00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:36.669
by a month or more.
长达一个月甚至更久。

24
00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:39.145
Why delay?
他们为什么要推迟？

25
00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:43.465
Why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time?
为什么不趁着这一重要的纪念性时刻为孩子命名？

26
00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:46.640
Well, they delay because they're afraid.
他们推迟，是因为害怕，

27
00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:50.044
They're afraid their baby will die.
他们害怕他们的孩子活不了多久。

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.050
And this loss might be a little more bearable without a name.
没有取名字，或许能让死去孩子的父母更好受一点。

29
00:01:57.068 --> 00:02:00.973
A face without a name might help them feel
一张没有名字的脸或许能够

30
00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:03.766
just a little less attached.
让他们的丧子之痛不那么刻骨铭心。

31
00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:07.316
So here we are in one part of the world --
我们所处的世界这端，

32
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.081
a time of joy, excitement, dreaming of the future of that child --
对于新生命的到来如此热切，激动，充满希望。

33
00:02:12.713 --> 00:02:14.975
while in another world,
但在世界另一端，

34
00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.919
parents are filled with dread,
那些同为父母的人，却总是满怀忧虑，

35
00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:21.518
not daring to dream of a future for their child
他们甚至不敢去奢望孩子的未来

36
00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.408
beyond a few precious weeks.
哪怕这“未来”的定义，仅仅是未来几周。

37
00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.005
How can that be?
为什么会这样？

38
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:36.756
How can it be that 2.6 million babies die around the world before they're even one month old?
为什么全球范围内会有260万的新生儿在未满月就已夭折？

39
00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:39.721
2.6 million.
260万

40
00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:43.173
That's the population of Vancouver.
那可是温哥华的人口总数。

41
00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:46.451
And the shocking thing is:
而最令人痛心的是：

42
00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:48.161
Why?
为什么？

43
00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:51.955
In too many cases, we simply don't know.
在发生了这么多悲剧后，我们仍旧一无所知。

44
00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:57.091
Now, I remember recently seeing an updated pie chart.
我最近看过一张扇形统计图，

45
00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:59.283
And the pie chart was labeled,
这张图是关于

46
00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.819
"Causes of death in children under five worldwide."
全球五岁以下儿童死亡原因的统计。

47
00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:07.703
And there was a pretty big section of that pie chart, about 40 percent --
扇形图中很大的一部分，大约有40%，

48
00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:11.089
40 percent was labeled "neonatal."
40%的死亡原因标注为“新生的”。

49
00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.274
Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.
“新生的”并不能算致死原因。

50
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.507
Neonatal is simply an adjective,
它仅仅是一个形容词，

51
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:22.399
an adjective that means that the child is less than one month old.
形容那些尚未满月的婴儿。

52
00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:27.833
For me, "neonatal" said: "We have no idea."
在我看来，“新生的”意为“我们一无所知”。

53
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.090
Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.
而我作为一名科学家，一名医生，

54
00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:32.607
I want to fix things.
我想弥补这些不幸。

55
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.265
But you can't fix what you can't define.
但是对于我们甚至都无法定义的对象，修补谈何容易。

56
00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:42.815
So our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents
所以为了找回那些父母的梦想，

57
00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.016
is to answer the question:
首先我们必须回答这个至关重要的问题：

58
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.989
Why are babies dying?
为什么新生儿们还在不断夭折呢？

59
00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:51.914
So today, I want to talk about a new approach,
今天，我想要谈论一种新的解决方案。

60
00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.875
an approach that I feel
这一方案在我看来

61
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:58.583
will not only help us know why babies are dying,
将不仅能揭开婴儿早夭的原因，

62
00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:04.372
but is beginning to completely transform the whole field of global health.
更是将全面改善全人类健康的现状。

63
00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:09.181
It's called "Precision Public Health."
这一方案叫作“精准公共卫生”。

64
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:15.435
For me, precision medicine comes from a very special place.
对我来说，精准医疗的起点不同寻常。

65
00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:19.521
I trained as a cancer doctor, an oncologist.
我曾作为一名癌症医师，一名肿瘤学家接受专业训练。

66
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.517
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better.
我进入这一领域是因为我想要帮助人们减轻痛苦，

67
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:28.116
But too often my treatments made them feel worse.
但常常事与愿违，我的治疗往往让他们更加痛苦。

68
00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:35.564
I still remember young women being driven to my clinic by their moms --
我至今仍记得那些年轻女孩坐着母亲的车 来到我的诊所求医，

69
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:41.230
adults, who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers.
即使她们已是成年人，却仍要在母亲的帮助下才能走进检测室。

70
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:43.771
They were so weak
她们非常虚弱

71
00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:46.024
from the treatment I had given them.
而正是我的治疗方案让她们如此虚弱。

72
00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:51.303
But at the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer,
可是当时，在与癌症抗争的前线，

73
00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:52.961
we had few tools.
我们别无选择。

74
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.542
And the tools we did have couldn't differentiate
而我们仅有的化疗手段无法区别

75
00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:00.840
between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard
我们意在消灭的癌细胞

76
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.929
and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve.
和那些我们想要保护的健康细胞。

77
00:05:06.483 --> 00:05:09.438
And so the side effects that you're all very familiar with --
而化疗的副作用你们早已耳熟能详：

78
00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:12.296
hair loss, being sick to your stomach,
脱发掉发，恶心反胃，

79
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.434
having a suppressed immune system, so infection was a constant threat --
免疫系统遭抑制，因此感染的威胁无处不在

80
00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.784
were always surrounding us.
一直潜伏在我们的周围。

81
00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:23.514
And then I moved to the biotechnology industry.
之后我将工作重心转到了生物科技产业。

82
00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.169
And I got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients
同时我仍立志寻找新的治疗乳腺癌的方法，

83
00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:35.560
that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells.
新方法必须能够更好地将健康的细胞与非健康细胞或癌细胞区分开。

84
00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:38.409
It's a drug called Herceptin.
这是一种叫做赫赛汀（Herceptin)的药物。

85
00:05:39.163 --> 00:05:42.399
And what Herceptin allowed us to do
赫赛汀使得我们能够

86
00:05:42.423 --> 00:05:47.634
is to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer,
精确地锁定HER2阳性乳腺癌细胞，

87
00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:51.538
at the time, the scariest form of breast cancer.
这是当时最为棘手的乳腺癌。

88
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:55.746
And that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells,
而这样的精确度，使我们强有力地攻击癌细胞，

89
00:05:56.547 --> 00:06:00.637
while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells.
同时不影响到正常的细胞。

90
00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.977
A huge breakthrough.
这是一项创举。

91
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:06.081
It felt like a miracle,
简直像是一种奇迹，

92
00:06:06.911 --> 00:06:09.860
so much so that today,
这样的奇迹在如今不胜枚举。

93
00:06:09.884 --> 00:06:12.415
we're harnessing all those tools --
如今我们使用着各种工具，

94
00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:18.500
big data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more --
大数据，患者监控，基因序列等等，

95
00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:21.845
to tackle a broad variety of diseases.
来应对各种疾病。

96
00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:27.933
That's allowing us to target individuals
这使得我们可以针对不同的患者

97
00:06:27.957 --> 00:06:31.241
with the right remedies at the right time.
在恰当的时间对症下药。

98
00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:37.011
Precision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy.
“精准医疗” 在癌症治疗领域掀起了一场革命。

99
00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:39.077
Everything changed.
它改变了一切。

100
00:06:40.007 --> 00:06:43.128
And I want everything to change again.
而我希望这一切能够再一次改变。

101
00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:46.286
So I've been asking myself:
因此我不断地问自己：

102
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.128
Why should we limit
为什么我们要将

103
00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:52.961
this smarter, more precise, better way to tackle diseases
这一更为先进，更为准确，更好的治疗疾病的方法

104
00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:54.148
to the rich world?
限制在富人阶层？

105
00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:57.437
Now, don't misunderstand me --
不要误解我的话，

106
00:06:57.461 --> 00:07:02.696
I'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like Herceptin to the developing world,
我并不是在宣扬将诸如赫赛汀这样昂贵的药品带入第三世界，

107
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.970
although I'd actually kind of like that.
虽然其实这也不失为一个好主意

108
00:07:05.527 --> 00:07:07.492
What I am talking about
但我想要传递的

109
00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:11.884
is moving from this precise targeting for individuals
是将这些为个体客制化的医疗服务

110
00:07:11.908 --> 00:07:14.551
to tackle public health problems
向大范围公共卫生的范畴推进

111
00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:16.316
in populations.
不是以个人为单位是以总人口为单位

112
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:21.806
Now, OK, I know probably you're thinking, 
我知道你们可能会认为

113
00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:25.906
"She's crazy. You can't do that. That's too ambitious."
“你疯了，你不能那么做。那代价太大了。“

114
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.152
But here's the thing:
但事实是：

115
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.298
we're already doing this in a limited way,
尽管受到种种制约，我们已经开始实施这一计划，

116
00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:35.392
and it's already starting to make a big difference.
而且它已经开始产生显著的效果。

117
00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:37.955
So here's what's happening.
我来告诉你们它究竟改变了什么

118
00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:41.362
Now, I told you I trained as a cancer doctor.
我刚才说了，我所受的是癌症医生的专业训练。

119
00:07:41.386 --> 00:07:45.835
But like many, many doctors who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,
然而像许多在上世纪八十年代的旧金山地区受教育的医生一样，

120
00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:47.950
I also trained as an AIDS doctor.
我所受的专业培训也包含了艾滋病治疗。

121
00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:50.505
It was a terrible time.
那是段艰难岁月。

122
00:07:51.324 --> 00:07:53.362
AIDS was a death sentence.
艾滋病就是死亡的代名词。

123
00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:55.831
All my patients died.
我所有的病人都死了。

124
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.053
Now, things are better,
尽管现在情况有所好转，

125
00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:03.656
but HIV/AIDS remains a terrible global challenge.
但艾滋病毒和艾滋病仍然是可怕的全球性难题。

126
00:08:04.293 --> 00:08:09.744
Worldwide, about 17 million women are living with HIV.
如今在世界范围内，有大约1700万的女性是艾滋病毒携带者。

127
00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:13.861
We know that when these women become pregnant,
我们知道一旦这些女性怀孕，

128
00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:16.498
they can transfer the virus to their baby.
她们所携带的艾滋病毒很可能会传染给她们的孩子。

129
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:20.623
We also know in the absence of therapy,
我们也很清楚地知道，由于医疗条件的不足，

130
00:08:20.647 --> 00:08:24.130
half those babies will not survive until the age of two.
那些孩子中有半数活不过两岁。

131
00:08:25.266 --> 00:08:30.403
But we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee
可我们也了解到抗逆转录病毒治疗几乎能够确保

132
00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:33.378
that she will not transmit the virus to the baby.
艾滋病毒携带的母体不会将病毒传染给婴儿。

133
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.061
So what do we do?
所以我们该怎么做？

134
00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:37.908
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach, 
我们将采取一种通用的治疗方法，

135
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.090
kind of like that blast of chemo,
有点类似一种大范围的化疗，

136
00:08:40.114 --> 00:08:43.294
would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world.
为此我们必须要检测和治疗世界上每一位孕妇。

137
00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:45.153
That would do the job.
这样就能达成目标。

138
00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.961
But it's just not practical.
可这显然是不现实的。

139
00:08:49.043 --> 00:08:54.683
So instead, we target those areas where HIV rates are the highest.
所以作为替代，我们针对那些艾滋病高发的地区。

140
00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:59.641
We know in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa
在撒哈拉以南的非洲国家，

141
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:03.827
we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest.
我们可以在艾滋病高发的地区检测和治疗孕妇。

142
00:09:04.614 --> 00:09:07.772
This precision approach to a public health problem
这一针对公共健康问题的精确手段

143
00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:14.834
has cut by nearly half HIV transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years.

144
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:19.670
(Applause)
（掌声）

145
00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:25.827
Screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world
对于第三世界中特定地区的孕妇进行筛查

146
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:28.955
is a powerful example

147
00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:34.494
of how precision public health can change things on a big scale.
精准公共卫生能够如何大范围地改善现状。

148
00:09:36.272 --> 00:09:37.423
So ...
所以

149
00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:39.210
How do we do that?
我们将如何达成这一步？

150
00:09:39.234 --> 00:09:41.399
We can do that because we know.
我们之所以能够实现是因为我们清楚。

151
00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:44.034
We know who to target,
我们清楚该锁定哪一类人群，

152
00:09:44.058 --> 00:09:45.745
what to target,
该锁定哪一项疾病，

153
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:48.061
where to target and how to target.
在什么环境进行锁定，以及如何进行锁定。

154
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:52.807
And that, for me, are the important  elements of precision public health:
在我看来，这些都是精准公共卫生中最为重要的要素。

155
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.888
who, what, where and how.
什么人，什么疾病，什么地点，以及怎么做。

156
00:09:57.634 --> 00:10:01.535
But let's go back to the 2.6 million babies
现在让我们再回到260万早夭的婴儿

157
00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.576
who die before they're one month old.
他们夭折时都尚未满月。

158
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.860
Here's the problem: we just don't know.
其中最大的问题在于：我们一无所知。

159
00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:09.037
It may seem unbelievable,
这听起来可能非常荒谬，

160
00:10:08.597 --> 00:10:13.938
but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality
但是在那些婴儿早夭率居高不下的地区

161
00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:16.959
in those countries with the highest infant mortality
我们探求其根本原因的途径

162
00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.979
is a conversation with mom.
仅仅是通过与那些母亲对话

163
00:10:19.768 --> 00:10:24.146
A health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child,

164
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.839
"Was the baby vomiting? Did they have a fever?"
”孩子过世前是否呕吐，是否有发烧？“

165
00:10:27.863 --> 00:10:29.812
And that conversation may take place
而这一段对话也许就发生在

166
00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:33.747
as long as three months after the baby has died.
孩子夭折后仅仅三个月内

167
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:37.919
Now, put yourself in the shoes of that mom.

168
00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:43.015
It's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation.
这是一场多么令人心碎与备受折磨的对话

169
00:10:43.653 --> 00:10:46.582
And even worse -- it's not that helpful,
更糟的是，它对于我们的研究并没有多少帮助。

170
00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:50.408
because we might know there was a fever or vomiting,
因为即便我们得知孩子有发烧或呕吐的症状，

171
00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:52.145
but we don't know why.
我们仍然不知道症状背后的根本原因。

172
00:10:52.991 --> 00:10:56.473
So in the absence of knowing that knowledge,
因此由于缺少对此类事件的认知，

173
00:10:56.497 --> 00:10:59.479
we cannot prevent that mom, that family,
我们对于如何帮助那位母亲和她的家庭

174
00:10:59.503 --> 00:11:01.601

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.573
from suffering the same tragedy.
仍然束手无策。

176
00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:08.098
But what if we applied a precision public health approach?
但是假如我们能够在这些地区尝试精准公共卫生呢？

177
00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:10.278
Let's say, for example,
比如说，

178
00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:13.236
we find out in certain areas of Africa
我们发现在非洲的某些地区中，

179
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.006
that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection

180
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.577
transferred from the mother to the baby,
而这种感染是由母体传给婴儿的，

181
00:11:19.601 --> 00:11:22.074
known as Group B streptococcus.
这种细菌，我们称之为B群链球菌。

182
00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:25.316
In the absence of treatment,

183
00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:30.555
mom has a seven times higher chance that her next baby will die.
这位母亲下一个孩子的死亡率将提高七倍。

184
00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:35.845
Once we define the problem, we can prevent that death
一旦找出问题根源所在，我们就能用像青霉素一样

185
00:11:35.869 --> 00:11:39.952
with something as cheap and safe as penicillin.
相对便宜且安全的治疗手段来避免这类死亡。

186
00:11:41.714 --> 00:11:44.265
We can do that because then we'll know.
我们能这么做是因为我们知道了原因，

187
00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:46.386
And that's the point:
而接下来的便是重中之重：

188
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.846
once we know, we can bring the right interventions
一旦我们弄清楚，我们就能在正确的地点

189
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.409
to the right population in the right places

00:11:56.793 --> 00:12:00.545
With this approach, and with these interventions
通过这种医疗尝试和这些介入治疗

192
00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:02.594
and others like them,
以及其他类似手段，

193
00:12:02.618 --> 00:12:04.329
I have no doubt
我坚信

194
00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:06.900
that a precision public health approach

195
00:12:06.924 --> 00:12:10.410
can help our world achieve our 15-year goal.
能够帮助我们实现“15年目标”

196
00:12:11.243 --> 00:12:17.233
And that would translate into a million babies' lives saved every single year.
这一进步每一年都能挽救近100万婴儿的生命。

197
00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:22.383
One million babies every single year.
每年挽救一百万个婴儿。

198
00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:25.368
And why would we stop there?
同时我们绝不会止步于此，

199
00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:29.436
A much more powerful approach to public health --
随后将是在公共卫生领域更为强有力的尝试。

200
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.225
imagine what might be possible.
请大家想象一下它所可能带来的无限可能。

201
00:12:32.732 --> 00:12:36.121
Why couldn't we more effectively tackle malnutrition?
营养不良将不再是问题。

202
00:12:37.463 --> 00:12:41.740
Why wouldn't we prevent cervical cancer in women?
宫颈癌也将不再是问题。

203
00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:45.470
And why not eradicate malaria?
疟疾的根除将同样不再是问题。

204
00:12:45.494 --> 00:12:46.495
(Applause)
（掌声）

205
00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.732

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:54.551
So, you know, I live in two different worlds,
现在你们能了解到，我所生活的两个不同的世界，

208
00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:57.783
one world populated by scientists,
其中一个都是科学家，

209
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.307
and another world populated by public health professionals.
另一个则都是公共卫生领域的专家。

210
00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:05.567
The promise of precision public health
精准公共卫生成功的关键

211
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:07.915
is to bring these two worlds together.
就在于它们的相互融合。

212
00:13:08.696 --> 00:13:12.241
But you know, we all live in two worlds:
但同时你们也要明白，我们都活在另外两个世界中：

213
00:13:13.074 --> 00:13:16.153
the rich world and the poor world.
富人的世界和穷人的世界。

214
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.430
And what I'm most excited about about precision public health
而在这两个相距甚远的世界之间架起桥梁

215
00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:23.913
is bridging these two worlds.
则是我对于精准公共卫生制度最为激动的部分。

216
00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:27.891
Every day in the rich world,
就像在富人世界的每一天里，

217
00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:31.170
we're bringing incredible talent and tools --
我们都以我们的需求为转移

218
00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:33.153
everything at our disposal --
调动出色的人才和工具

219
00:13:33.177 --> 00:13:39.948
to precisely target diseases in ways I never imagined would be possible.
来以我从未想过的方式精确地锁定疾病。

220
00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:44.988
Surely, we can tap into that kind of talent and tools

221
00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:47.450
to stop babies dying in the poor world.
来阻止在贫困世界中婴儿的夭亡。

222
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:51.070
If we did,
如果我们真能够做到，

223
00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:55.151
then every parent would have the confidence
那么每一位父母都将能够拥有

224
00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:59.503
to name their child the moment that child is born,
在他们的孩子出生的那一刻就给予他们名字的信心，

225
00:14:00.566 --> 00:14:05.751
daring to dream that that child's life will be measured in decades,
更能有勇气以数十年为单位去希冀孩子的未来，

226
00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:07.562
not days.
而不是仅仅以天数去衡量婴儿的寿命。

227
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.301
Thank you.
谢谢。

228
00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:16.957
