Hello, my name is Dessa,

2
00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:18.116
and I'm a member of a hip-hop collective called Doomtree.

3
00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:20.326
I'm the one in the tank top.

4
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.008
(Laughter)
（笑声）

5
00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:27.074
And I make my living as a performing, touring rapper and singer.
以巡演表演为生—— 是一位独立歌手，也是说唱歌手。

6
00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:30.312
When we perform as a collective, this is what our shows look like.
我们的集体表演就是这样子。

7
00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:32.374
I'm the one in the boots.

8
00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.828
There's a lot of jumping. There's a lot of sweating.
表演中有很多地方要跳跃和出汗；

9
00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:36.879
It's loud. It's very high-energy.

10
00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:40.734
Sometimes there are unintentional body checks onstage.

12
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:49.016
It's kind of a hybrid between an intramural hockey game and a concert.
有点像校内音乐会 和曲棍球比赛的混合。

13
00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:53.298
However, when I perform my own music as a solo artist,
然而当我作为一个独唱的艺术家，

14
00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:56.090
I tend to gravitate towards more melancholy sounds.
更倾向于呈现忧郁的声音。

15
00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:00.746
A few years ago, I gave my mom the rough mixes of a new album,
几年前，我给母亲 一张混音的新专辑，

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.294
and she said, "Baby, it's beautiful, but why is it always so sad?"

00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:08.818
"You always make music to bleed out to."
“你总是创作渗出悲凉的音乐。”

19
00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:12.351
And I thought, "Who are you hanging out with that you know that phrase?"
我想，“你是和谁一起 学会用到这个词组？”

20
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.301
(Laughter)
（笑声）

21
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:17.800
But over the course of my career, I've written so many sad love songs
在我的职业生涯中， 写了非常多忧伤的爱情歌曲，

22
00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:19.776
that I got messages like this from fans:
以致常常收到这样的信息：

23
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.652
"Release new music or a book. I need help with my breakup."
“尽快出新音乐或书籍， 帮助我分手。”

24
00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:25.214
(Laughter)
（笑声）

25
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:30.355
And after performing and recording and touring those songs for a long time,
在演出，录制音像 和巡演了很长一段时间之后，

26
00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.860
I found myself in a position
我发现自己的专业定位、

27
00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:38.141
in which my professional niche was essentially romantic devastation.
是达致完全摧毁浪漫的地步。

28
00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:41.478
What I hadn't been public about, however,
然而我并没有公开，

29
00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:45.032
was the fact that most of these songs had been written about the same guy.
这些歌曲大部分都是 和同一个人有关的。

30
00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:48.825
And for two years, we tried to sort ourselves out,

31
00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.825
and then for five
然后是五年，

32
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.502
and on and off for 10.
并断断续续十年了。

33
00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.900
And I was not only heartbroken,

34
00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.406
but I was kind of embarrassed that I couldn't rebound
而且有点尴尬，因为我没办法

35
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.405
from what other people seemed to recover from so regularly.

37
00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.539
I just couldn't figure out how to put the love down.
我只是不知道如何把那爱放下。

38
00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:17.079
Then, drinking white wine one night,
有一天，在喝了一夜的酒之后，

39
00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:20.550
I saw a TED Talk by a woman named Dr. Helen Fisher,
我看了海伦.费雪 女博士的TED演讲，

40
00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:25.492
and she said that in her work, she'd been able to map the coordinates of love
她提到她已经能够绘制出人类大脑中

41
00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:26.708
in the human brain.
恋爱的坐标。

42
00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:30.473
And I thought, well, if I could find my love in my brain,
于是我想，如果我可以 在大脑中找到我的恋情所在，

43
00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:31.944
maybe I could get it out.
也许可以把它拿出來。

44
00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:33.358
So I went to Twitter.
所以我上了推特,

45
00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:35.589
"Anybody got access to an fMRI lab,
“无论是午夜或任何时候，

46
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.701
like at midnight or something?
谁有进入功能磁共振实验室的许可？

47
00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:40.214
I'll trade for backstage passes and whiskey."
我会用后台通行证和威士忌交换。”

48
00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:41.831
(Laughter)
（笑声）

49
00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.507
And that's Dr. Cheryl Olman,
那是谢丽尔·奥尔曼博士，

50
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.628
who works at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research.
她在明尼苏达大学的 磁共振研究中心工作。

51
00:02:47.652 --> 00:02:49.167
She took me up on it.
她接受了我的邀请。

52
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.648
I explained Dr. Fisher's protocol,
我解释了费雪医生的治疗方案，

53
00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.223
and we decided to recreate it with a sample size of one, me.
商议后决定用我， 这唯一一个样本做这个试验。

54
00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:57.377
(Laughter)
（笑声）

55
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:01.768
So I got decked out in a pair of forest green scrubs,
我穿了一身森林绿色的衣服，

56
00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:05.238
and I was laid on a gurney
躺在轮床上，

57
00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:07.120
and wheeled into an fMRI machine.
然后被推入功能磁共振仪里。

58
00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:09.184
If you're unfamiliar with that technology,
如果你对那个技术不太熟悉，

59
00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:12.675
essentially, an fMRI machine is a big, tubular magnet
功能磁共振仪基本上 是一个大型的管状磁铁，

60
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:16.992
that tracks the progress of deoxygenated iron in your blood.
可以跟踪血液中缺氧铁的变化。

61
00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:19.724
So it's essentially figuring out what parts of your brain
它会弄清楚你大脑的哪一部分，

62
00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:22.608
are making the biggest metabolic demand at any given moment.
在给定时刻有最大的新陈代谢需求。

63
00:03:22.632 --> 00:03:24.298
And in that way, it can figure out
由此计算出

64
00:03:23.742 --> 00:03:26.119
which structures are associated with a task,
大脑哪个部分跟某一身体活动相关联，

65
00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:30.062
like tapping your finger, for example, will always light up the same region,
比如重复轻敲你的手指， 总能点亮同一的区域，

66
00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:31.566
or in my case,
或者在我的例子中，

67
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.538
looking at pictures of your ex-boyfriend
望着我前男友的照片一段时间，

68
00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:38.394
and then looking at pictures of a dude who just sort of resembled my ex-boyfriend
然后看一张有点像我前男友的照片，

69
00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.262
but for whom I had no strong feelings.
但我对这人没有强烈的感情；

70
00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:41.612
He was the control.
这是对照实验。

71
00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:42.959
(Laughter)
（笑声）

72
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:45.023
And when I left the machine,
当我离开仪器，

73
00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:48.455
we had these really high-resolution images of my brain.
他们得到了我大脑 非常高解析度的图像。

74
00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.061
We could cleave the two halves apart.
他们可以将我的大脑成像分成两半，

75
00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:58.908
We could inflate the cortex to see inside all of the wrinkles, essentially,
可以使皮质膨胀，看到所有皱纹，

76
00:03:58.932 --> 00:04:02.519
in a view that Dr. Cheryl Olman called the "brain skin rug."
这就是谢丽尔·奥尔曼博士 所说的“大脑外皮地毯”。

77
00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:04.548
(Laughter)
（笑声）

78
00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:10.251
And we could see how my brain had behaved when I looked at images of both men.
当我分别看这两个男人的照片时， 我的大脑有不同反应。

79
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:12.442
And this was important.
这点很重要。

80
00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:14.953
We could track all of the activity
这样可以追踪我的所有脑部活动，

81
00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:18.179
when I looked at the control and when I looked at my ex,
包括我看到前男友 及对照男士的情况，

82
00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:22.492
and it was in comparing these data sets that we'd be able to find the love alone,
然后通过对比这两种情况的数据集， 就能够寻找我的所爱是谁；

83
00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:26.492
in the same way that, if I were to step on a scale fully dressed
跟我穿着衣服站在体重秤上，

84
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.859
and then step on it again naked,
然后裸体站在秤上的道理类似，

85
00:04:28.883 --> 00:04:32.326
the difference between those numbers would be the weight of my clothing.
这些数据的差异就是我衣服的重量。

86
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.041
So when we did that data comparison, we subtracted one from the other,
所以当做了那些数据比较之后， 我们找到了有用的结果，

87
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:40.141
we found activity in exactly the regions that Dr. Fisher would have predicted.
实验发现活跃的领域 正好就在费雪医生预测的地方。

88
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.210
That's me.
那是我。

89
00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:46.241
And that's my brain in love.
那是我恋爱的大脑。

90
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.741
There was activity in that little orange dot, the ventral tegmental area,
那个小橘点是在中脑的活动， 位于腹侧被盖区，

91
00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:54.170
that kind of loop of red is the anterior cingulate
那红色的环是前扣带，

92
00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:58.279
and that golden set of horns is the caudates.
那对金色的角就是尾状核。

93
00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:01.869
After she had had time to analyze the data with her team
她与团队成员，包括安德里亚和菲尔，

94
00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:03.923
and a couple of partners, Andrea and Phil,
花了些时间分析了数据之后，

95
00:05:03.947 --> 00:05:06.655
Cheryl sent me an image, a single slide.
谢丽尔给我发来一张图片。

96
00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:11.418
It was my brain in cross section,
是我大脑的横截面，

97
00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:13.142
with one bright dot of activity
这个亮点代表脑部活动，

98
00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:16.207
that represented my feelings for this dude.
是我对这家伙的感情。

99
00:05:18.174 --> 00:05:20.140
And I'd known I was in love,
我知道我在恋爱中，

100
00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:23.782
and that's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths.
这就是我很漫长的反常现象。

101
00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:27.885
But having an image that proved it felt like such a vindication,
我感觉这张照片是一种确认，

102
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.683
like, "Yeah, it's all in my head, but now I know exactly where."
就像，“一切都在我的脑海里， 现在找到正确的位置了。”

103
00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:34.776
(Laughter)
（笑声）

104
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:38.960
And I also felt like an assassin who had her mark.
我也觉得自己像个刺客， 身上带着标记；

105
00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:41.625
That was what I had to annihilate.
那是我必须除去的。

106
00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:46.591
So I decided to embark on a course of treatment
所以我决定参加一项治疗课程，

107
00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:48.950
called "neurofeedback."
称为“神经反馈”。

108
00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:52.612
I worked with a woman named Penijean Gracefire,
我和佩尼琴·格雷斯菲尔女士合作，

109
00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:56.601
and she explained that what we'd be doing was training my brain.
她解释道只需要做那些 用来训练我大脑的事情，

110
00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.242
We're not lobotomizing anything.
无需进行脑叶切开术；

111
00:05:58.266 --> 00:06:01.015
We're training it in the way that we would train a muscle,
用类似训练肌肉的方法 来训练我的大脑，

112
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.829
so that it would be flexible enough and resilient enough
让它有足够的灵活性和弹性，

113
00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:06.410
to respond appropriately to my circumstances.
来应对我的处境，做出适当的反应。

114
00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:10.576
So when we're on the treadmill, we would anticipate
当我们在跑步机上

115
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.088
that our heart would beat and pound,
会预期心脏砰砰跳动，

116
00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:16.424
and when we're asleep, we would ask that that muscle slow.
而当我们睡觉时， 会让心跳慢下来。

117
00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:21.696
Similarly, when I'm in a long-term, viable, loving romantic relationship,
同样，当我处于一段长期、 可维持、充满爱的浪漫关系中，

118
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.444
the emotional centers of my brain should engage,
我大脑的情感中心会参与其中，

119
00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:28.026
and when I'm not in a long-term, viable, emotional, loving relationship,
而当我不处于一段长期、 可维持、激情的恋爱关系中时，

120
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.161
they should eventually chill out.
大脑的情感中心最终会冷静下来。

121
00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.991
So she came over with a set of electrodes just smaller than a dime
佩尼琴带来了一套比 一角硬币还小的电极，

122
00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:39.407
that were sensitive enough to detect my brainwaves
敏感度足以穿透头骨， 头发和头皮、

123
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:42.423
through my bone and hair and scalp.
侦测我的脑电波。

124
00:06:42.447 --> 00:06:46.528
And when she rigged me up, I could see my brain working in real time.
当我佩戴上了电极， 就可以实时检测我的大脑活动。

125
00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.069
And in another view that she showed me,
同时她给我看的另一幅图，

126
00:06:51.093 --> 00:06:55.058
I could see exactly which parts of my brain were hyperactive,
可以清楚看到我大脑 哪些部分极度活跃，

127
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:56.245
here displayed in red;
就是红色的部分；

128
00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.526
hypoactive, here displayed in blue;
不活跃的，用蓝色來表示；

129
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.764
and the healthy threshold of behavior,
以及健康的行为门槛，

130
00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.202
the green zone, the Goldilocks zone,
就是绿色和金色的区域，

131
00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:05.750
which is where I wanted to go.
那活跃区要改变的颜色。

132
00:07:05.774 --> 00:07:08.730
And we can, in fact, isolate just those parts of my brain
事实上，在我大脑中可以识别出

133
00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:11.456
that were associated with the romantic regulation
在费雪研究中发现

134
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.646
that we'd identified in the Fisher study.
与浪漫规则相关的部分。

135
00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:19.591
So Penijean, several times,
有几次，佩尼琴

136
00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:21.489
hooked me up with all her electrodes,
给我接上了所有的电极，

137
00:07:22.393 --> 00:07:25.619
and she explained that I didn't have to do or think anything.
她指示我什么都不用做，不用想。

138
00:07:25.643 --> 00:07:28.210
I just essentially had to hold pretty still
我只要保持安静，

139
00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.093
and stay awake
保持清醒，

140
00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:31.395
and watch.

And every time my brain operated in that healthy threshold,

144
00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:46.767
I got a little run of harp or vibraphone music.
都是听到一些竖琴或电颤琴音乐。

on my dad's flat-screen TV.

She said the learning would be essentially unconscious.

protein structures or the waveform of a ringing bell,

so that they couldn't influence the results.

I think this is the desired result," comma, yes, question mark.
