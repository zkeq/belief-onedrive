00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.821
In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque
在2012年，当我图画Jara Mosque清真寺塔尖

2
00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.776
in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia,
在我的家乡突尼西亚南部城市加贝斯，

3
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.067
I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.
我从没想过墙上的涂鸦会给这个城市带来如此多的关注。

4
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:29.017
At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown,
一开始，我只是在我的家乡寻找一座墙面，

5
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:32.271
and it happened that the minaret was built in '94.
正好是94年建造的这个尖塔。

6
00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:37.539
And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey.
长达18年的时间里，57米高的混凝土依旧是灰色的。

7
00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:42.038
When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do,
当我第一次见到阿訇，我告诉他我的计划，

8
00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.506
he was like, "Thank God you finally came,"

9
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.337
and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody

10
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.654
to do something on it.
能够做些什么。

11
00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:53.328
The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything --
最神奇的是，这位阿訇没有问我任何有关

12
00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:56.762
neither a sketch, or what I was going to write.
我要画些什么的问题。

13
00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:00.652
In every work that I create, I write messages

14
00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:04.799
with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.

15
00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.314
I use quotes or poetry.
我书写引述或是诗文。

16
00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:10.680
For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message
就这个尖塔而言，我想最与它相关的是

17
00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.320
to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran,
在清真寺上书写来自古兰经里的话，

18
00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:14.955
so I picked this verse:
因此我选择了这条：

19
00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.219
"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female,
“人类啊，我把你们造成男性和女性，

20
00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:21.658
and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other."
我把你们分成部落和民族，为的是你们互相了解。”

21
00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.999
It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance
这是普世的号召，为了和平，宽容和接纳

22
00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:28.992
coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media.
这样美好的讯息，我们并不时常从媒体上获得。

23
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:33.249
I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting,
我很惊讶地看到当地居民是如何回应这样的图画的，

24

25
00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:40.309
from international press all around the world.

26
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.334
For the imam, it was not just the painting;
对那位阿訇来说，这并不只是图画；

27
00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:45.223
it was really deeper than that.
比图画更加深邃。

28
00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:48.684
He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city,

29
00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.579
and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia.

31
00:01:54.753 --> 00:01:56.999
the political context of Tunisia at this time,

32
00:01:57.023 --> 00:02:00.507
and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way

33
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:02.173
were not insignificant.
并不是毫无建树的。

34

Writing messages is the essence of my artwork.

38
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.726
really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing.
都需要花些时间来破译我写的文字内容。

You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.

Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;
