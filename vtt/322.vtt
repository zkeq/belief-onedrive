5
00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:25.354
a bit special.
有点特殊。

6
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:32.139
I cannot tell you how much I enjoy watching cities from the sky, from an airplane window.
我无法形容我有多么享受从飞机上俯视整个城市。

7
00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:35.731
Some cities are calmly industrious,

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.295
like Dusseldorf
比如杜塞尔多夫，

or Istanbul,
伊斯坦堡这样

15
00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:53.021
and their patina full of history.
充满历史的城市。

16

I see cities as living beings.
我把城市当作生命体，

17
00:00:56.334 --> 00:00:58.802
And when I discover them from far above,
当我从高空鸟瞰它们的时候，

18
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:03.251
I like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space.
我喜欢寻找那些组成了城市框架的主要街道和高速公路。

19
00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.315
Especially at night,
特别是在晚上，

20
00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.162
when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden:
人们让这些城市的动脉变得异常鲜红和金黄：

21
00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:16.249
the city's vascular system performing its vital function right before your eyes.
城市的血液循环系统生机勃勃地展现在你的眼前。

22
00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.229
But when I'm sitting in my car
但是，当我坐在自己的车里，

23
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.132
after an hour and a half of commute every day,
每天有一个半小时的时间都堵在路上，

24
00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.033
that reality looks very different.
眼前的一切就截然不同了。

25
00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:27.075
(Laughter)
（笑声）

26
00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:28.293
Nothing --
什么都没有——

27
00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:30.007
not public radio,
没有广播节目，

28
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.164
no podcast --
没有播客，

29
00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:32.242
(Laughter)
（笑声）

30
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.275
Not even mindfulness meditation
连能让这些时间变得有点意义的

31
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.914
makes this time worth living.
专注的冥想都做不到。

32
00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:37.547
(Laughter)
（笑声）

33
00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:39.046
Isn't it absurd
这难道不可笑吗？

34
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.527
that we created cars that can reach 130 miles per hour
我们制造了能够达到时速210公里的汽车，

35
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:49.173
and we now drive them at the same speed as 19th-century horse carriages?
却以19世纪马车一样的速度驾驶它们。

36
00:01:49.197 --> 00:01:50.456
(Laughter)
（笑声）

37
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.222
In the US alone,
仅仅在美国，

38
00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:57.640
we spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014.
2014年我们就花了296亿小时在通勤上。

39
00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:59.719
With that amount of time,
在这么多的时间里，

40
00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:04.034
ancient Egyptians could have built 26 Pyramids of Giza.
古埃及人都能造出26个胡夫金字塔了。

41
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.028
(Laughter)
（笑声）

42
00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:06.526
We do that in one year.
我们用了一年就做到了。

43
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.926
A monumental waste of time, energy and human potential.
这是对时间，精力和人类潜能巨大的浪费。

44
00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:13.151
For decades,
数十年来，

45
00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.483
our remedy for congestion was simple:
我们解决交通拥堵的方式都很简单：

46
00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:18.548
build new roads or enlarge existing ones.
建造新路或者拓宽现存的道路，

47
00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:20.168
And it worked.
效果还算不错。

48
00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:22.650
It worked admirably for Paris,
巴黎的建设卓有成效，

49
00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.764
when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings
他们拆毁了上百幢历史建筑，

50
00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:29.740
to create 85 miles of transportation-friendly boulevards.
建造了137公里的交通友好型的大道。

51
00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.919
And it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities.
在当今快速兴起的城市中也是如此。

52
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.765
But in more established urban centers,
但是在很多繁华的城市中心，

53
00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.719
significant network expansions are almost impossible:
较大的道路拓宽几乎是不可能的：

54
00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:42.663
habitat is just too dense,
建筑过于密集，

55
00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:44.660
real estate, too expensive
房价过高，

56
00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:46.744
and public finances, too fragile.
公共建设资金太少。

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.205
Our city's vascular system is getting clogged, it's getting sick,
我们的城市血液循环系统正在变得拥堵，无法正常发挥功能，

58
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.836
and we should pay attention.
应该引起我们的重视。

59
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.563
Our current way of thinking is not working.
我们现有的思维方式已经不起作用了。

60
00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:57.913
For our transportation to flow,
为了让交通流动起来，

61
00:02:57.937 --> 00:03:00.288
we need a new source of inspiration.
我们需要一种新的灵感。

62
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.699
So after 16 years working in transportation,
我在交通部门工作了16年，

63
00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:08.803
my "aha moment" happened when speaking with a biotech customer.
在和一个生物技术背景的顾客交谈时突然茅塞顿开。

64
00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:11.470
She was telling me how her treatment
她告诉我她的研究

65
00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:14.737
was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system.
如何影响了我们血液循环系统的一些特殊性质。

66
00:03:15.402 --> 00:03:17.870
"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --
“哇”，我想到，“我们的血液循环系统，

67
00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:20.970
all the veins and arteries in our body
我们身体内的所有动脉和静脉，

68
00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:24.201
making miracles of logistics every day."
每天都在创造生理的奇迹。"

69
00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:27.090
This is the moment I realized
就是那个时候我意识到，

70
00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:30.097
that biology has been in the transportation business
生物学已经存在于交通方面

71
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:31.632
for billions of years.
几十亿年了。

72
00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:34.548
It has been testing countless solutions
它已经测试过无数方法，

73
00:03:34.572 --> 00:03:37.871
to move nutrients, gases and proteins.
转移养分，气体和蛋白质。

74
00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:42.713
It really is the world's most sophisticated transportation laboratory.
这真的是世界上最复杂的交通系统。

75
00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:48.649
So, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us?
所以，如果交通拥堵的解决方案就在我们体内呢？

76
00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:50.980
I wanted to know:
我想知道，

77
00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:54.784
Why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives,
为什么绝大多数时间，血液在血管中不会堵塞？

78
00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:58.416
when our big cities get clogged on a daily basis?
但我们的大城市每天都会拥堵？

79
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.374
And the reality is that you're looking at two very different networks.
事实上，这是两种非常不同的系统。

80
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.652
I don't know if you realize,
我不知道你意识到了没有，

81
00:04:06.043 --> 00:04:10.740
but each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies --
实际上我们每个人体内都有近十万公里长的血管——

82
00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:12.058
60,000 miles.
十万公里。

83
00:04:12.082 --> 00:04:15.951
That's two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference, inside you.
你的体内有两个半的地球赤道。

84
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.999
What it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us,
这意味着血管在你身体里无处不在，

85
00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:22.050
not just under the surface of our skin.
不仅只在皮肤下面（看得见的地方）。

86
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.639
But if you look at our cities,
但是，看看我们的城市，

87
00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:27.761
yes, we have some underground subway systems
是，我们的确有一些地铁系统，

88
00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:30.201
and some tunnels and bridges,
一些隧道和桥梁，

89
00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:32.505
and also some helicopters in the sky.
以及天空中的直升机。

90
00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.588
But the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground,
但是绝大多数的交通都是在地面，

91
00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:37.789
on the surface.
在地表上。

92
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.625
So in other words,
换句话说，

93
00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:44.028
while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us,
我们体内的血管系统是立体结构的，

94
00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:47.136
our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional.
而绝大多数的城市交通系统都是平面结构的。

95
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:50.734
And so what we need is to embrace that verticality.
所以我们需要利用更多的纵向空间。

96
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.675
If our surface grid is saturated,
如果地表已经没有多余的空间，

97
00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.597
well, let's elevate our traffic.
那我们就把交通系统抬高。

98
00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:59.878
This Chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams --
这个中国的概念巴士能够凌驾于拥堵的交通道路之上，

99
00:05:00.514 --> 00:05:06.209
that was an eye-opener on new ways to think about space and movement inside our cities.
这种对城市内部的空间和移动的思考方式多么让人大开眼界。

100
00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:08.495
And we can go higher,
然而我们可以把

101
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:12.811
and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid.
交通系统的位置继续抬升，像我们的输电网络一样。

102
00:05:13.788 --> 00:05:16.805
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi are talking about testing
特拉维夫和阿布扎比正在考虑检测

103
00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:20.661
these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods.
这些构成未来交通网络的悬挂式磁性胶囊车厢。

104
00:05:21.285 --> 00:05:24.181
And we can keep climbing, and fly.
我们还可以继续抬高，甚至飞翔。

105
00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:27.010
The fact that a company like Airbus
事实上像空中客车这样的公司

106
00:05:27.034 --> 00:05:30.342
is now seriously working on flying urban taxis
正在认真研究城市飞行的士，

107
00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:31.739
is telling us something.
看起来前景光明。

108
00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:37.321
Flying cars are finally moving from science-fiction déjà vu
飞行汽车终于从科幻小说进入到了

109
00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:40.034
to attractive business-case territory.
引人注目的商业领域。

110
00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:41.668
And that's an exciting moment.
这是令人激动的时刻。

111
00:05:42.235 --> 00:05:44.864
So building this 3-D transportation network
建造这些立体交通网络

112
00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:50.206
is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams.
是减少或解决交通堵塞的方法之一。

113
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.640
But it's not the only one.
但还有其他方法。

114
00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:53.695
We have to question
我们还要考虑

115
00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.486
other fundamental choices that we made, like the vehicles we use.
其他基本的选择，比如我们使用的交通工具。

116
00:05:58.098 --> 00:06:00.438
Just imagine a very familiar scene:
想象一个非常熟悉的场景：

117
00:06:00.803 --> 00:06:02.936
You've been driving for 42 minutes.
你已经开车42分钟了。

118
00:06:03.476 --> 00:06:06.199
The two kids behind you are getting restless.
后座的两个小孩开始不耐烦。

119
00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:07.924
And you're late.
而且你要迟到了。

120
00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:10.839
Do you see that slow car in front of you?
你看到前面那辆慢吞吞的车了吗？

121
00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:13.112
Always comes when you're late, right?
总是在你迟到的时候出现，对吧？

122
00:06:13.136 --> 00:06:14.271
(Laughter)
（笑声）

123
00:06:14.295 --> 00:06:16.458
That driver is looking for parking.
那个驾驶员正在寻找停车位。

124
00:06:17.013 --> 00:06:19.230
There is no parking spot available in the area,
那块区域没有空车位，

125
00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.597
but how would he know?
但是他怎么会知道？

126
00:06:21.372 --> 00:06:28.037
It is estimated that up to 30 percent of urban traffic is generated by drivers looking for parking.
据估计，有将近30%的城市交通拥堵是由驾驶员找车位造成的。

127
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.785
Do you see the 100 cars around you?
你看见身边的100辆车了吗？

128
00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.980
Eighty-five of them only have one passenger.
其中的85辆都只有一位乘客。

129
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:38.611
Those 85 drivers could all fit in one Londonian red bus.
那85个驾驶员能够装满一辆伦敦红巴士。

130
00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.310
So the question is:
所以问题是，

131
00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:43.394
Why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most?
为什么我们浪费这么多宝贵的空间？

132
00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:45.180
Why are we doing this to ourselves?
为什么我们要这样对自己？

133
00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:47.520
Biology would never do this.
生物学永远不会这样。

134
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.056
Space inside our arteries is fully utilized.
我们血管的空间都被充分利用了。

135
00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:53.066
At every heartbeat,
每一次心跳

136
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.245
a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen
产生的血压能够为数百万血细胞压缩大量的氧气进行运输，

137
00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:01.158
that quickly flow throughout our body.
并很快流遍全身。

138
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:05.521
And the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either.
连血细胞内的微小空间也没有被浪费。

139
00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:07.894
In healthy conditions,
在健康条件下，

140
00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:11.956
more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized.
超过95%的氧容量都能够被使用。

141
00:07:12.314 --> 00:07:16.883
Can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities were 95 percent full,
你能够想象如果我们城市里超过95%的交通工具都是满载的，

142
00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:20.291
all the additional space you would have to walk, to bike
剩下的空间，能够让你自由地走路，骑车，

143
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.853
and to enjoy our cities?
享受这个城市吗？

144
00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:25.949
The reason blood is so incredibly efficient
血液是如此有效率的原因

145
00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:30.952
is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues;
是我们的血细胞不只作用于特定器官或组织；

146
00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:34.428
otherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins.
要不然，我们的血管可能也会堵塞。

147

149
00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:41.210
And because our network is so extensive,

192
00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:50.647
Would we need traffic lights?

193
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:52.267
Would we need lanes?
我们需要车道吗？

194
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.790

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:48.298
And by a strange paradox,
听上去像是一种悖论，

213
00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:51.133
the more robotized our traffic grid will be,
但我们的交通越机械自动化，

214
00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:53.913
the more organic and alive its movement will feel.
