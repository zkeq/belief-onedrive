In fact, I want them to become beautiful.

9
00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.796
soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work

others -- a genuine act of giving back.

我们要把9000名软件工程师和1000名创意工作者整合在一起工作。

And to unify these immensely different cultures,

39
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.436
we were going to launch a third, new brand.

40
00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.956
And the new brand color was going to be orange.

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.396
And as we were going through the budget for the rollouts,
我们在讨论品牌推广预算时，

42
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.476
we decided last minute

43
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.156
to cut the purchase of 10,000 orange balloons,
我们决定砍掉购买一万只橙色气球的计划，

44
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.980
which we had meant to distribute to all staff worldwide.
我们本想把这些气球发给全球员工。

45
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.780
They just seemed unnecessary and cute in the end.

46
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.636
I didn't know back then

that our decision marked the beginning of the end --

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.860
that these two organizations would never become one.
两家公司不可能顺利合并。

49
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.436
And sure enough, the merger eventually failed.
果然，合并以失败告终。

50
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.276
Now, was it because there weren't any orange balloons?

51
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.900
No, of course not.
不，当然不是。

52
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.740
But the kill-the-orange-balloons mentality permeated everything else.
但是这种砍掉气球的心态弥漫到了其他所有事情上。

53
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.716
You might not always realize it, but when you cut the unnecessary,

Leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary.

56
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.740
So do not kill your orange balloons.

very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers.

And what are relationships other than a string of microinteractions?
除了每天简单的交流，人际关系还包括什么呢？

63
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.156
There are hundreds of these every day in our organizations

that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.996
is not the great gesture or the lofty promise,

68
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.340
it's small moments of attachment.

we tout the strength of weak ties

72
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.996
but we underestimate the strength of strong ones.

73
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.916
We forget the words of the writer Richard Bach who once said,
我们忘记了作家Richard Bach说过的话：

74
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.156
"Intimacy --
“亲密感——

75
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.396
not connectedness --

76
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.740
intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."
亲密感，是孤独的反义词。”

77
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.100
So how do we design for organizational intimacy?

that it had to have this conversation first with its own staff.

to one of the Khajuraho Temples,

Not only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve,

90
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.756

and created a lasting bond amongst themselves.

for a three-day strategy retreat.

wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,

and full of enthusiasm.

(Applause)
（掌声）

112
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.876
Because wigs erase hierarchy,

113
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.756
and hierarchy kills intimacy --
而层级会扼杀亲密感——

114
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.996
both ways,
不管对CEO还是实习生

115
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.700
for the CEO and the intern.

116
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.396
Wigs allow us to use the disguise of the false

to show something true about ourselves.

118
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.156
And that's not easy in our everyday work lives,

because the relationship with our organizations
因为我们的组织中的人际关系，

120
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.420
is often like that of a married couple that has grown apart,

121
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.076
suffered betrayals and disappointments,

122
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.420
and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again.

124
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.556
The risk to be ugly.
变丑的风险。

125
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.916
[Be Ugly]

126
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.196
So many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces

127
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.836
that look like anything but work:
让它们看起来像度假区、咖啡店、游乐场、大学校园，

128
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.876
vacation resorts, coffee shops, playgrounds or college campuses --
而偏偏不像是用来工作的。

129
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.116
(Laughter)
（笑声）

130
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.316
Based on the promises of positive psychology,
基于积极心理学的考虑，

131
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.716
we speak of play and gamification,
我们把工作变成玩耍、游戏，

132
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.276
and one start-up even says that when someone gets fired,
甚至有创业公司在解雇员工的时候，

133
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.596
they have graduated.
说他们是“毕业”了。

134
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.596
(Laughter)
（笑声）

135
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.116
That kind of beautiful language only goes "skin deep,
这些美丽的语言是“肤浅的，

136
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.380
but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"
但丑陋却可以深入骨髓，”

137
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.276
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.
这是作家多萝西·帕克的原话。

138
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.820
To be authentic is to be ugly.
坦白事实，就意味着丑陋。

139
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.036
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,
这不是说你不能开心，或者必须向庸俗和自私妥协，

140
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.460
but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth.
而是你应该说出丑陋的事实。

141
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.836
Like this manufacturer

142
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.596
that wanted to transform one of its struggling business units.

144
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.716
and there were hundreds of them --
并钉在大白板上，

145
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.036
that had become obstacles to better performance.
有几百项之多。

146
