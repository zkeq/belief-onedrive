1
00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:16.748
Did you know that one of the first fertility drugs
你知道世界上第一例催孕药

2
00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:21.129
was made from the pee of Catholic nuns,
是用天主教修女的尿合成的，

3
00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:23.423
and that even the Pope got involved?
甚至与大主教也有关系？

4
00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.781
So, this is totally true.
这是真实的事件。

5
00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:31.723
Back in the 1950s, scientists knew that when women enter menopause,
20世纪50年代，科学家们 发现当女人进入更年期时，

6
00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:36.270
they start releasing high levels of fertility hormones in their urine.
她们的尿液中便开始 出现含量极高的生殖激素。

7
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:38.910
But there was this doctor named Bruno Lunenfeld,
但有位布鲁诺 · 卢内费尔德医生

8
00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:43.134
who wondered if he could actually isolate those hormones from the urine
想知道，他是否能 将那些激素从尿液中分离，

9
00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:46.722
and use it to help women who are having trouble getting pregnant.
并用其帮助不孕不育的妇女们。

10
00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.389
Obviously, the problem with this was that in order to test this idea,
问题很明显：为试验 这一想法，他需要搜集

11
00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:55.011
he needed a lot of pee from older women.
许多年长妇女的尿液。

12
00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:57.189
And that is not an easy thing to find.
然而那绝非易事。

13
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.191
So he and his colleagues got special permission from the Pope
他和他的同行获得了大主教的许可，

14
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:07.135
to collect gallons and gallons of urine
从几百名年长的天主教修女那里

15
00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.400
from hundreds of older Catholic nuns.
收集了若干加仑的尿液。

16
00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:12.873
And in doing so,
这样一来，

17
00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:14.894
he actually isolated hormones
他就将那些仍利于今天的妇女

18
00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:17.979
that are still used to help women get pregnant today,
怀孕的激素分离了出来。

19
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.823
though now, they can be synthesized in a lab,
虽然现在，这种生殖激素 可以在实验室合成，

20
00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.898
and gallons of pee aren't necessary.
并且也不再需要大量的尿液。

21
00:01:24.763 --> 00:01:26.476
So why am I standing up here,
那么，为什么我要站在这里，

22
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.445
telling this wonderfully intellectual audience about nun pee?
向在座的各位精英讲述修女的尿液呢？

23
00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:36.252
Well, I'm a science journalist and multimedia producer,
事实上，我是一名总是 痴迷于研究恶心事物的

24
00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:40.112
who has always been fascinated by gross stuff.
科学记者兼多媒体制作人。

25
00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:44.919
So fascinated, in fact, that I started a weekly YouTube series
这种痴迷驱使我在一周前 创立了一个名为“恶心科学”的

26
00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:46.746
called "Gross Science,"
每周Youtube视频系列，

27
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.881
all about the slimy, smelly, creepy underbelly
展示了自然，医药和科技中 所有黏滑的，难闻的，

28
00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.428
of nature, medicine and technology.
令人毛骨悚然的部分。

29
00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:56.008
Now, I think most of us would agree
我认为大多数人会承认

30
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.880
that there's something a little gross about pee.
尿液有点恶心。

31
00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.985
You know, it's something that we don't really like to talk about,
尿液属于一些我们不喜欢谈论的事物，

32
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.196
and we keep the act of doing it very private.
而我们会将其控制得极其私密。

33
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.945
But when Lunenfeld peered into the world of pee,
但当卢内费尔德仔细观察了尿液的世界，

34
00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.524
he discovered something deeply helpful to humanity.
他发现了使人类受益匪浅的东西。

35
00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:16.588
And after a year and a half of making my show,
从我制作节目以来的一年半中，

36
00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:21.166
I can tell you that very often when we explore the gross side of life,
我可以告诉各位，当我们 探索生命中恶心的部分时，

37
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.336
we find insights that we never would have thought we'd find,
我们经常会获得意料之外的洞察，

38
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.114
and we even often reveal beauty that we didn't think was there.
甚至经常揭示一些出乎意料的美。

39
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.918
I think it's important for us to talk about gross things for a few reasons.
我认为谈论恶心的事物 对我们来说很重要，有这么几个原因。

40
00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:35.665
So, first of all, talking about gross stuff
首先，谈论恶心的事物

41
00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.363
is a great tool for education,
堪称教育的利器，

42
00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.712
and it's an excellent way to preserve curiosity.
也是保持好奇心的绝妙方法。

43
00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:43.459
To explain what I mean,
为了解释我的意思，

44
00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:47.457
why don't I tell you a little bit about what I was like as a child?
倒不如分享一点我小时候的经历。

45
00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:52.210
So, I was what you might call a gross kid.
也许你们会称曾经的我 为一名让人恶心的孩子。

46
00:02:52.936 --> 00:02:55.913
In fact, my love of science itself
事实上，我对科学本身的热爱

47
00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:59.786
began when my parents bought me a slime chemistry set
开始于我的父母带给我的 一套黏糊糊的化学实验工具，

48
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.397
and was then only enhanced
并通过我在六年级生物课上

49
00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:05.786
by doing gross experiments in my sixth-grade biology class.
做的恶心的实验得到了进一步发展。

50
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.342
We did things like, we swabbed surfaces around our classroom
例如：我们在教室的 各个角落收集细菌，

51
00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:12.849
and cultured the bacteria we'd collected,
并进行培育。

52
00:03:12.873 --> 00:03:15.032
and we dissected owl pellets,
我们同样剖析了猫头鹰 呕吐出的唾馀，

53
00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:20.421
which are these balls of material that are undigested that owls barf up,
包含着猫头鹰吞下去的 一团团不消化的食物，

54
00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:23.232
and it's really kind of gross and awesome and cool.
那确实有些恶心，怪异，但也很酷。

55
00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:26.803
Now, the fact that I was obsessed with gross stuff as a kid
实际上，我孩提时对恶心事物的痴迷，

56
00:03:26.827 --> 00:03:28.223
is not so revolutionary.
也算不上具有革命性的意义。

57
00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:31.032
You know, lots of kids are really into gross things,
许多孩子们的生活都 离不开恶心的事物，

58
00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:36.631
like playing in dirt or collecting beetles or eating their boogers.
像玩泥巴，收集甲虫或吃鼻屎。

59
00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:38.551
And why is that?
为什么呢？

60
00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:42.472
I think really little kids are like little explorers.
我认为，小孩子就像小探险家一样。

61
00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:45.635
They just want to experience as much as they can
他们只想尽他们所能地探索，

62
00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.802
and don't have any idea about the relative acceptability
但对相对接受性毫无概念，

63
00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:52.723
of touching a ladybug versus a stinkbug.
例如接触瓢虫或臭虫。

64
00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:55.302
They just want to understand how everything works
他们只想知道万物如何存在，

65
00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:57.730
and experience as much of life as they can.
并尽他们所能地一探究竟。

66
00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.054
And that is pure curiosity.
那是纯粹的好奇心。

67
00:04:00.793 --> 00:04:02.049
But then adults step in,
接着，成人逐渐涉足，

68
00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:07.204
and we tell kids not to pick their noses and not to touch the slugs or toads
我们告诉孩子们不要挖鼻孔， 不要摸鼻涕虫或蟾蜍，

69
00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:09.500
or whatever else they find in the backyard,
或者其它一切他们在后院找到的，

70
00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:11.016
because those things are gross.
因为那些东西很恶心。

71
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:14.199
And we do that in part to keep kids safe, right?
我们那样做部分是为了保证 孩子们的安全，对吗？

72
00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:17.373
Like, maybe picking your nose spreads germs
例如，挖鼻孔也许会传播细菌，

73
00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:20.802
and maybe touching that toad will give you warts,
摸蟾蜍也可能会带来疣疾。

74
00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.064
even though I don't actually think that's true.
虽然如此，我却不敢苟同。

75
00:04:23.088 --> 00:04:25.730
You should feel free to touch as many toads as you want.
你们应该感到无拘无束， 想摸多少蟾蜍就摸多少。

76
00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:30.651
So at a certain point, when kids get a little bit older,
到了某个阶段，当孩子们逐渐长大，

77
00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:33.034
there's this way that engaging with gross stuff
这样对待恶心事物的方法，

78
00:04:33.058 --> 00:04:34.794
isn't just about curiosity,
已不只与好奇心有关，

79
00:04:34.818 --> 00:04:37.738
it's also about, sort of, finding out where the limits are,
某种程度上，也有可能与发现极限有关，

80
00:04:37.762 --> 00:04:39.905
pushing the boundaries of what's OK.
在允许的情况下会试图超越那个极限。

81
00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:44.739
So, lots of kids of a certain age will have burping competitions
因此，在特定年龄的许多孩子 会参加间歇性的比赛，

82
00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:47.719
or competitions to see who can make the grossest face.
看谁的鬼脸最丑。

83
00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:51.822
And they do that in part because it's a little bit transgressive, right?
某种意义上，正因为这样做 会有点出格，对吗？

84
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.230
But there's another layer to why we define stuff as gross.
不过，我们对恶心事物的定义， 还出于另一方面的考虑。

85
00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:02.690
As humans, we've sort of extended the concept of disgust to morality.
作为人类，我们多多少少将 恶心的概念拓展到了道德的范畴。

86
00:05:03.048 --> 00:05:06.167
So, the psychologist Paul Rozin would say
心理学家保罗 · 罗兹说过：

87
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.476
that many of the things we categorize as gross
“许多我们归为恶心的东西，

88
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.626
are things that reminds us that we're just animals.
其实提醒了我们，我们只是动物。

89
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:17.574
These are things like bodily fluids and sex
例如体液，性，

90
00:05:17.598 --> 00:05:20.966
and physical abnormalities and death.
以及身体畸形和死亡。

91
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.667
And the idea that we're just animals can be really unsettling,
确实，我们是动物的 概念使人不安。

92
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.429
because it can be this reminder of our own mortality.
因为它会提醒我们自己终有一死。

93
00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:33.360
And that can leave many of us with this deep existential angst.
它还让我们中的许多人怀有存在性焦虑。

94
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.633
Rozin would say that there's this way
罗兹这样说过：

95
00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:41.032
in which disgust and the avoidance of gross things
“厌恶和逃避恶心的事物

96
00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:44.658
becomes not just a way to protect our bodies,
不仅成为保护我们身体的方式，

97
00:05:44.682 --> 00:05:47.911
it becomes a way to protect our souls.
而且还保护了我们的精神。

98
00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:51.723
I think at a certain point, kids really begin to internalize
我认为在某个阶段， 讨厌的事物和不道德之间的关系

99
00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:55.722
this link between disgusting things and immorality.
会开始在孩子们的心底扎根。

100
00:05:55.746 --> 00:06:01.500
And while I don't have any concrete data to back up this next idea,
虽然目前我没有具体的数据 来支持我的下一个想法，

101
00:06:01.524 --> 00:06:06.451
I think that for a lot of us, it happens around the time we hit puberty.
但我认为对大多数人来说，当我们 迈入青春期时，这种情况便已司空见惯。

102
00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:11.053
And you know -- yeah, I know.
就像这样——没错， 这就是那个时期的我。

103
00:06:11.564 --> 00:06:14.675
So during puberty, our bodies are changing,
我们的身体在 青春期时开始改变，

104
00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.203
and we're sweating more, and girls get their periods,
出更多的汗，女孩开始月经。

105
00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:21.386
and we're thinking about sex in this way that we never did before.
我们从未这样思考过性。

106
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.648
And through the human capacity for abstraction,
受人类抽象思维能力的限制，

107
00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:26.834
this shame can settle in.
这种羞愧便很容易立足。

108
00:06:26.858 --> 00:06:29.318
So we don't necessarily just think,
我们不会只想到：

109
00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:32.549
"Oh, my goodness, something really gross is happening to my body!"
“哦，天呐，我的身体 正经历着恶心的东西！“

110
00:06:32.573 --> 00:06:36.214
We think, "Oh my God, maybe I'm gross.
我们会想：“哦，上帝，也许我很恶心。

111
00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:40.416
And maybe that means that there's something bad or wrong about me."
也许那意味着我出了什么问题。”

112
00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:46.080
The thing is, that if you de facto associate gross stuff with immorality,
问题是，如果你们将恶心的事物 与不道德联系在一起，

113
00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:49.024
you lose a huge part of your curiosity,
就会失去绝大部分的好奇心。

114
00:06:49.048 --> 00:06:52.047
because there is so much out there in the world
因为世界包罗万象，

115
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:53.619
that is a little bit gross.
总有一部分多少有点恶心。

116
00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:56.127
Like, think about going for a walk in the woods.
举个例子，想象在丛林中漫步。

117
00:06:56.151 --> 00:07:00.318
You could just pay attention to the birds and the trees and the flowers
你或许只会注意到鸟，树和花。

118
00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:01.501
and that would be fine,
它们很漂亮。

119
00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:06.493
but in my view, you'd be missing a bigger and more awesome picture
但我看来，你会错失 这个星球中生命更加广阔和

120
00:07:06.517 --> 00:07:08.079
of life on this planet.
奇妙的一面。

121
00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:11.302
There are cycles of decay that are driving forest growth,
衰变的循环正驾驭着森林的生长，

122
00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:14.556
and there are networks of fungus beneath your feet
在你们脚下存在着网络般的菌类植物，

123
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.707
that are connecting literally all of the plants around you.
与你们身边的植物紧密相连。

124
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:19.064
That's really amazing.
那确实令人吃惊。

125
00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:23.122
So I feel like we should be talking about gross stuff early and often
所以我认为我们应该 尽早并且频繁的与年轻人

126
00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:24.306
with young people,
谈论恶心的东西，

127
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.706
so they feel like they're actually allowed to claim this bigger picture
让他们真切地感受到需要 体会我们星球上的生命中

128
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.641
of life on our planet.
广阔的一面。

129
00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:34.230
The good news is that for many of us, the fascination with gross stuff
对大多数人来说好消息是： 恶心事物的乐趣

130
00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.175
doesn't exactly go away,
并未消失殆尽，

131
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.659
we just kind of pretend like it's not there.
我们只是有意无意地忽视了它们的存在。

132
00:07:38.683 --> 00:07:42.969
But truthfully, we all spend sort of a big part of our lives
但事实上，我们一生中 都花费了很长时间

133
00:07:42.993 --> 00:07:45.396
just trying not to be gross.
试着摆脱恶心的感觉。

134
00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.263
When you really think about it,
当你们认真思考它时，

135
00:07:47.287 --> 00:07:52.762
we're sort of just like bags of fluids and some weird tissues
我们也不过是皮包着骨头的 生物罢了——薄薄的皮肤

136
00:07:52.786 --> 00:07:55.468
surrounded by a thin layer of skin.
包裹着液体和奇怪的组织。

137
00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:58.373
And to a certain extent,
在有些情况下，

138
00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:02.508
multiple times a day, whether consciously or subconsciously,

139
00:08:02.532 --> 00:08:06.158
I need to remind myself not to fart publicly.

140
00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:07.715
(Laughter)
（笑声）

141
00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:11.596
You know, we're desperately trying to avoid being gross all the time,
很显然，我们总是不顾一切地 尝试躲避恶心的东西。

142
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.473
so I think many of us take this kind of voyeuristic delight
所以我认为大多数人会 将这种偷窥的愉悦

143
00:08:14.497 --> 00:08:16.160
in learning about gross things.
运用到恶心的事物上。

144
00:08:16.591 --> 00:08:18.361
This is certainly true of kids;
尤其是儿童。

145
00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:20.999
the number of middle school teachers who show my videos
在科学课堂上展示我的视频的

146
00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:22.064
in their science classes
中学老师的数量

147
00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:23.444
is a testament to that.
就是很好的证明。

148
00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:26.175
But I think it's totally true of adults, too.
但我认为这个观点也适用于成人。

149
00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:29.390
You know, I think we all love hearing about gross stories,
我认为我们都 喜欢听闻恶心的故事，

150
00:08:29.414 --> 00:08:34.968
because it's a socially acceptable way to explore the gross side of ourselves.
毕竟，探索我们自己恶心的一面， 在社会层面上是可以接受的。

151
00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:37.558
But there's this other reason
但让我觉得

152
00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:40.154
that I think talking about gross stuff is so important.
谈论恶心的东西很重要， 还有着另一层原因。

153
00:08:40.178 --> 00:08:45.334
A while back, I made a video on tonsil stones -- sorry, everyone --
前不久，我制作了一个关于扁桃体结石的 视频——抱歉让大家觉得不舒服——

154
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:50.382
which are these balls of mucus and bacteria and food
这些镶嵌在你们扁桃体的 粘液球，细菌和食物

155
00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:53.364
that get lodged in your tonsils and they smell really terrible,

156
00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:56.627
sometimes you cough them up and it's like -- it's awful.
有时候会随着咳嗽喷出来， 让人感到很恶心。

157
00:08:57.977 --> 00:09:00.540
And many, many people have experienced this.

158
00:09:00.564 --> 00:09:03.913
But many of the people who have experienced this

159
00:09:03.937 --> 00:09:05.992
haven't really had a forum to talk about it.

160
00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:10.336
And today, this video that I made is my most popular video.
时至今日，我制作的这个视频 仍然是所有视频中最流行的一个。

161
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.635
It has millions of views.

162
00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:14.643
(Laughter)
（笑声）

163
00:09:15.604 --> 00:09:20.334
And the comment section for that video became sort of like a self-help section,
并且那个视频的评论区变得 有点像一个励志互助区，

164
00:09:20.358 --> 00:09:23.196
where people could talk about their tonsil stone experiences
人们可以谈论他们 扁桃体结石的经历，

165
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.705
and, like, tips and tricks for getting rid of them.
比如摆脱它们的方法和策略。

166
00:09:25.729 --> 00:09:29.147
And I think it became this great way for people to talk about something
这已经成了人们敞开心扉

167
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.509
that they'd never felt comfortable taking about publicly.
直面问题的绝佳途径。

168
00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:37.906
And that is wonderful when it's about something as goofy as tonsil stones,
能讨论诸如扁桃体结石一类 恶心的东西，确实大快人心，

169
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.405
but it's a little sad when a video can have an effect like that
然而对于一个有相同影响力的视频，

170
00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:45.049
when it's about something as common as periods.
例如月经一类的平常事物， 情况就不那么乐观了。

171
00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:49.326
Last February, I released a video on menstruation,
去年二月，我发布了 一个有关月经的视频，

172
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.763
and to this day, I am still getting messages

173
00:09:52.787 --> 00:09:57.709
from people around the globe who are asking me about their periods.
来自全世界人们 关于自己月经问题的留言。

174
00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:03.659
There are a lot of young people -- and some not-so-young people -- out there,

175
00:10:03.683 --> 00:10:06.318
who are worried that what's happening to their bodies

176
00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:08.048
is somehow not normal.
出现了一些异常。

177
00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.963
And, of course, I always tell them that I am not a medical professional,
当然，我总告诉她们我不是医学专家，

178
00:10:10.963 --> 00:10:14.096
and that, if possible, they should talk to a doctor.
如果可能的话，她们应该去咨询医生。

179
00:10:14.484 --> 00:10:17.699
But the truth of the matter is that everyone should feel comfortable
但事实上：所有人应该很自然地

180
00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:19.794
talking to a doctor about their own bodies.
与医生谈论她们自己的身体。

181
00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:22.229
And that's why I think it's really important for us
这也是为什么我觉得

182
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:25.381
to start this dialogue about gross stuff from a pretty early age,
从年轻时开始直面恶心事物 对我们来说很重要，

183
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:27.125
so we can let our kids know
这样就可以让我们的孩子们懂得：

184
00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.159
that it's alright to have agency over your own body
应该有人关心你们的身体，

185
00:10:30.183 --> 00:10:31.603
and over your own health.
对你们的健康负责。

186
00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:34.384
There's another reason that talking to your doctor
与医生谈论健康和

187
00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:36.019
about your health and gross stuff
恶心的东西很重要的

188
00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:37.602
is really, really important.
另外一个原因是，

189
00:10:37.524 --> 00:10:41.748
Doctors and the scientific community can only address issues
医生和科研人员只有了解哪里出了问题，

190
00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:44.156
when they know there's something to address.
才能有针对性地解决这些问题。

191
00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:46.801
So one of the really interesting things I learned
当制作关于月经的视频时，我所了解的

192
00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:48.778
while making the video on periods,
一件非常有趣的事是：

193
00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:51.397
is that I was talking to this one scientist who told me
曾经有一名科学家告诉我，

194
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:56.103
there's actually still a lot we don't know about periods.
我们关于月经的认知实际上还很有限。

195
00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:59.300
There's a lot of basic research that still hasn't been done.
许多基础研究尚未完成。

196
00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:04.403
In part, that's just because there weren't a lot of scientists in the field
部分原因是，很多该领域的科学家，

197
00:11:04.427 --> 00:11:07.218
who were women, to ask questions about it.
尤其是女性，并未对月经表达出任何疑问。

198
00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:10.694
And it's also not a topic that women talk about publicly.
这也不是女性们会公开讨论的话题。

199
00:11:10.718 --> 00:11:13.025
So there's this gap in what we know,
我们在认知上的缺陷，

200
00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:15.742
just because no one was there to ask a question.
正是因为没人提出问题。

201
00:11:16.818 --> 00:11:21.308
There's one final reason that I think talking about gross stuff is so important,
我认为谈论恶心的东西很重要， 还有最后一层原因：

202
00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:24.720
and that's because you just never know what you're going to find
当剥开恶心的外皮时，

203
00:11:24.744 --> 00:11:28.268
when you peel back all those layers of disgustingness.
你们并不知道会有什么样的发现。

204
00:11:28.942 --> 00:11:32.722
So, take the California brown sea hare.
例如加州的棕色海兔。

205
00:11:33.117 --> 00:11:36.815
This is a sea slug that squirts this lovely, bright purple ink
这是一种向捕食者喷射这种可爱， 明亮的紫色墨水的

206
00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:38.926
at any creature that tries to eat it.
海蛞蝓。

207
00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:42.995
But it also happens to be one of the kinkiest creatures
它同时也适用于动物界中

208
00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:44.552
in the animal kingdom.
最扭曲的生物。

209
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.813
So these guys are hermaphrodites,
它们就是两性生物，

210
00:11:46.837 --> 00:11:50.016
which means they have both male and female genitalia.
意味着它们兼具雌雄生殖器官。

211
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.778
And when it's time to mate,
当到了交配的时期，

212
00:11:51.802 --> 00:11:57.127
up to 20 individuals will all get together in this kind of, like, conga line
像（古巴的）康加舞一样， 20多个个体会聚集一堂，

213
00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:59.037
and they'll all mate together.
互相交配。

214
00:11:59.061 --> 00:12:00.473
(Laughter)
（笑声）

215
00:12:02.308 --> 00:12:06.323
A single sea hare will inseminate the partner in front of it
单只海兔会向正前方的配偶射精，

216
00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:08.609
and receive sperm from the one behind,
并接受后方的精子。

217
00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:11.020
which is sort of like an awesome time-saver,
这倒是个省时省力的好方法，

218
00:12:11.044 --> 00:12:12.641
when you think about it.
不妨想象一下。

219
00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.780
(Laughter)
（笑声）

220
00:12:16.326 --> 00:12:19.461
But if scientists had only seen this and they were like,
但当科学家看到这个景象时，会说：

221
00:12:19.485 --> 00:12:22.397
"OK, we're just not going to touch that with a stick,"
“好吧，还是不要去碰它们，”

222
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.389
they would have missed the bigger thing about sea hares
但这样一来，他们就会错过 关于海兔更重要的

223
00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:27.103
that makes them really remarkable.
着实夺人眼球的事情。

224
00:12:27.127 --> 00:12:33.724
It turns out that these sea hares have a small number of very large neurons,
事实是：这些海兔仅有 少量的巨大神经元，

225
00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:37.978
which makes them excellent to use in neuroscience research.
这使得它们非常适合 被用于神经科学研究。

226
00:12:38.002 --> 00:12:42.553
And, in fact, the scientist Eric Kandel used them in his research
事实上，科学家艾瑞克 · 坎德尔 将它们运用在了他的实验中，

227
00:12:42.577 --> 00:12:46.127
to understand how memories are stored.
以理解记忆是如何存储的。

228
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.492
And you know what?
大家知道吗？

229
00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:49.783
He won a Nobel Prize for his work.
他还因此获得了诺贝尔奖。

230
00:12:50.358 --> 00:12:56.087
So go out there and pick up beetles and play in dirt and ask questions.
所以走出家门，捡拾甲壳虫， 玩玩泥巴，并心怀好奇。

231
00:12:56.111 --> 00:13:00.080
And own your fascination with gross stuff and don't be ashamed of it,
驾驭你们对恶心事物的兴趣，不要胆怯。

232
00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:02.423
because you never know what you're going to find.
因为你们永远不知道你会发现什么。

233
00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:05.653
And as I say at the end of all my videos,
就像我在所有视频的结尾说的：

234
00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:06.883
"Ew."
“好恶心哦！”

235
00:13:06.907 --> 00:13:08.312
Thank you.
谢谢。

236
00:13:08.336 --> 00:13:10.551
(Applause)
（掌声）
