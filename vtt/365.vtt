Food delivery.
外卖：

2
00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:17.629
It's the thing that saves millennials from starvation.

3
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.008
By my calculations,
根据我的计算，

4
00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:25.460
Americans order over 20 million restaurant deliveries every single day.
美国人每天会订购超过 2000 万份外卖。

5
00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:29.278
Over half of these deliveries are actually within walking distance.
这些外卖中超过半数实际上在步行距离之内。

6
00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:33.053
But nine out of 10 are delivered in cars.
但十分之九是开车送达的。

7
00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:35.753
So basically,
也就是说，

8
00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:39.475
we are moving a two-pound burrito in a two-ton car
我们每天在用两吨重的汽车将一公斤的墨西哥卷饼

12
00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:48.083
with heated seats.

We are addicted to our cars.
我们沉迷于开车。

15
00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:53.755
Did you know that in America,

16
00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:57.254
for every car, there are four parking spots?

00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:58.651
In some downtowns,

18
00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:01.762
over half of the real estate is for cars.
一半以上的地产被用于停放汽车。

19
00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:05.221
We have designed our cities around our cars,
我们围绕汽车设计了城市，

20
00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:09.681
because we drive whether we're going two miles or 200 miles.
因为无论要去 2 公里还是 200 公里以外的地方，我们都会开车，

21
00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:12.110
Solo, or with our whole family.
无论是独自一人，还是带上全家。

22
00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:17.420
We get into the same SUV to go buy coffee or a coffee table.

23
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:20.616
If we could free up some of these streets and parking lots,
如果我们能够腾出其中一些街道和停车场，

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.021
we could build more housing,
我们就可以修建更多的住房、

25
00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.148
more social spaces, more parks.
社交空间和公园。

26
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:25.834
But to do that,
但是要做到这一点，

27
00:01:25.858 --> 00:01:29.762
first, we need to rethink how we are using cars today.
首先，我们需要重新思考我们如今是如何使用汽车的。

28
00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:31.215
In the city of the future,
在未来的城市中，

29
00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.885
if you want to go five blocks, you summon a bike or a scooter.
如果想去五个街区之外，你可以叫来一辆自行车或踏板车。

30
00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.196
If you're in a rush, a passenger drone would pick you up.
如果你赶时间，可以让无人驾驶飞机来接你。

31
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.481
And if you need food, no need to have someone drive over --

32
00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:44.091
the food will make its way to you.
食物会自己来到你的身边。

33
00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:47.779
Let's go back to those 20 million a day restaurant deliveries.
让我们回到每天 2000 万次的外卖上来。

34
00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:50.970
If we could get these deliveries off the road,
如果这些外卖不再通过开车送达，

35
00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:57.183
we could reduce the need for as many as one and a half million cars just in the US.
那么我们仅在美国就能减少对多达 150 万辆汽车的需求，

36
00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:59.653
That's twice the size of San Francisco.
也就是旧金山车流量的两倍。

37
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:06.365
Now, think of the impact this could have on cities like Delhi, or my birth city of Tehran,
想象一下这会对德里或我的出生地德黑兰这样的城市造成怎样的影响，

38
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.873
where car pollution is killing thousands of people every year.
那里的汽车污染每年都会令数千人死亡。

39
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:15.275
So how do we get some of these deliveries off the road?
那么，我们如何才能让其中部分外卖不再依靠车辆呢？

40
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:18.211
Well, that's the question
这正是我和我的团队

41
00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:21.733
that my team and I have been obsessed with over the last three years.
在过去三年一直潜心研究的问题。

42
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.161
And the solution is actually one of the building blocks of the city of the future.
而解决方案实际上就是未来城市的基石之一。

43
00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.975
We've been creating small, self-driving robots
我们一直在制作小型自动驾驶机器人，

44
00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.626
that navigate quiet alleys and sidewalks
以步行的速度在安静的小巷中

45
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.332
on a walking pace
和人行道上行驶，

46
00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.926
and have a secured cargo to deliver you food and supplies.
并有安全的行李舱为你运送食物和补给。

47
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.124
Now, before I tell you more about the robots,
在我进一步介绍机器人之前，

48
00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:45.148
let's do a quick thought experiment.
让我们进行一个快速的思考实验。

49
00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:50.192
In your mind, picture a city with thousands of robots.

50
00:02:50.827 --> 00:02:52.161
Is it this one?

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.421
This Hollywood dystopia is what a lot of people expect.
很多人会想象出这类的好莱坞反乌托邦。

52
00:02:56.445 --> 00:03:02.127
But our job is to create a friendly future that's designed for people.
但是我们的工作是创造一个为人类设计的友好未来。

53
00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:05.118
So instead of making aliens,
因此，我们没有制作外星机械，

54
00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:08.824
we set out to create robots that are familiar.
而是着手制造令人熟悉的机器人，

55
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:11.920
Robots that would belong in our communities.

Think about it.
想一想。

59
00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:20.301
You're walking down the street,
你正在街上行走，

60
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.530
and you see your very first robot.
并看见了有生以来的第一个机器人。

61
00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:24.872
That's the moment when you're going to decide
正是这一瞬间能让你决定

62
00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:27.681
if this is a future you love or fear.

63
00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:31.957
And with a lot of people having these dystopian ideas,
在很多人的观念中，机器人是反乌托邦的，

64
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:34.203
we need to open their minds.
而我们需要让他们的思维变得开放。

65
00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:36.592
We want to surprise and delight them,
我们想让他们感到惊喜，

66
00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.772
so that we can win them over on first impression.

67
00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:41.200
This is what we came up with.

68
00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:43.994
It's familiar, but it's also surprising.

69
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.303
It's just a shopping cart,
它只是一辆购物车，

70
00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:50.087
but it also looks like we crossbred WALL-E with Minions.
但看起来又像是瓦力（WALL-E）与小黄人（Minions）的杂交体。

71
00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:53.673
If you live in San Francisco or Los Angeles,
如果你住在旧金山或洛杉矶，

72
00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:56.753
chances are one of these has already delivered your food.
其中一台可能已经给你送过了外卖。

73
00:03:57.302 --> 00:04:00.064
As soon as we put robots out on the street,
当我们将机器人投入使用后，

74
00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:02.235
we learned some really interesting problems.
我们马上了解到了一些非常有趣的问题。

75
00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.220
Like, how should robots cross the road?
比如说，机器人应该如何过马路？

76
00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:11.150
Or how should robots interact with people with visual or mobility impairments?
机器人该如何与有视力或行动障碍的人互动？

77
00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.919
We quickly realized that we need to teach our robots how to communicate with people.
我们很快就意识到，我们需要教机器人如何与人交流。

78
00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:21.538
People on the sidewalk come from every walk of life,
街上的人们来自各行各业，

79
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.780
so we needed to create a new language,
因此我们需要创造一种新的语言，

80
00:04:24.804 --> 00:04:26.549
kind of a universal language
一种通用的语言，

81
00:04:26.573 --> 00:04:31.073
so people and robots can understand each other right off the bat.
以便人和机器人可以立即相互理解。

82
00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:34.165
Because no one is going to be reading user manuals.
因为没有人会阅读用户手册。

83
00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.261
We started with eyes, because eyes are universal.
我们从眼睛开始，因为眼睛是共通的。

84
00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:41.223
They can show where the robot is going
它们可以显示机器人的前进方向，

85
00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:43.333
or if it's confused.
以及它是否陷入了困惑。

86
00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:46.198
Plus, eyes make robots more human.
另外，眼睛使机器人更人性化。

87
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:48.865
We also used sounds.
我们还使用了声音。

88
00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.199
For example, we created this running sound with frequent gaps
例如，我们创造了一种夹杂了频繁间隙的跑步声音，

89
00:04:53.223 --> 00:04:57.088
so that people with visual impairments could locate their robots
这样视力障碍者

90
00:04:55.638 --> 00:04:59.088
using the Doppler effect.
就能用多普勒效应来定位机器人。

91
00:04:59.088 --> 00:05:01.881
But it turned out these were not enough.
但是事实证明，这些还不够。

92
00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:03.119
At intersections,
在十字路口，

93
00:05:03.143 --> 00:05:05.143
cars would cut in front of our robots.
汽车会开到机器人面前。

94
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:07.683
Drivers were getting confused sometimes,
司机有时会感到困惑，

95
00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:11.751
because robots would take too long before they started crossing.
因为机器人要等很长时间才开始过马路。

96
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.287
Even ordinary pedestrians were getting confused.
甚至连普通的行人也感到了困惑。

97
00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:19.008
Sometimes, they couldn't figure out on which side to pass the robots,
有时，他们搞不明白该从哪一侧经过机器人，

98
00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:23.656
because robots make a lot of small adjustments to their direction as they move.
因为机器人在移动时会对方向进行很多微调。

99
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.132
This actually sparked a new idea.
这实际上激发了一个新想法。

100
00:05:26.445 --> 00:05:30.489
What if we used movement to create a universal language?
我们能不能用运动方式来创造一门通用语言？

101
00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:32.592
Like, at intersections,
比如，在十字路口，

102
00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:36.021
robots would gently move forward before they start crossing,
机器人在过马路之前会轻轻地向前移动，

103
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:38.640
to signal to drivers that it's their turn.
以向司机发出“轮到我了”的信号。

104
00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:41.684
If they see someone in a wheelchair,
看到轮椅时，

105
00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:45.802
they yield by pointing themselves away from the sidewalk,
它们会转向人行道外侧让出道路，

106
00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:48.119
to signal that they're not going to move.
以表明自己不会移动。

107
00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:51.191
Some of you may remember this.
你们中有些人可能还记得这件事。

108
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:56.653
In 2015, Canadian researchers sent a robot hitchhiking across the US.
2015 年，加拿大研究人员派出了一个机器人搭便车穿越美国。

109
00:05:57.497 --> 00:05:59.124
It didn't get very far.
它没能走太远。

110
00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:03.180
It turns out that robots can also use some social skills.
事实上，机器人也应当使用一些社交技能。

111
00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:05.318
Like, if they're being tampered with,
例如，卡内基· 梅隆大学的研究人员发现，

112
00:06:05.342 --> 00:06:10.754
Carnegie Mellon researchers have shown that small toy robots should play dead,
如果遭到了恶意摆弄，小型玩具机器人应该装死，

113
00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:13.620
because people feel bad when they think they broke it.
因为人们以为自己把它弄坏了时会感到不好受。

114
00:06:14.294 --> 00:06:16.310
But delivery robots aren't toys,
但是外卖机器人不是玩具，

115
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.889
they're not small, they are out there in public.
它们个头不小，它们会出入公共场所。

116
00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:22.191
We found that with delivery robots,
我们发现，对于外卖机器人，

117
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.151
to get people to stop tampering,
要使人们停止胡乱摆弄，

118
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.175
robots need to show awareness.
机器人需要表现出警觉。

119
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.230
It's kind of the opposite of playing dead.
这有点和装死相反。

120
00:06:29.612 --> 00:06:30.811
In this case,
在这种情况下，

121
00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:33.476
robots need to acknowledge the situation
机器人需要确认情况，

122
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.500
to get people to step away.
来让人们离开。

123
00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:37.811
Also, a word of advice.
另外，提个建议。

124
00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:40.730
If you are a robot and you see small kids,
如果你是机器人，并且看到了小孩，

125
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.754
run towards the closest adult.
请奔向最近的成年人。

126
00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:46.886
It turns out that some kids just love harassing robots.
事实证明，有些孩子就是喜欢骚扰机器人。

127
00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.830
So besides dystopia,
除了反乌托邦，

128
00:06:49.854 --> 00:06:52.918
Hollywood also promised us some really cool robots
好莱坞还向我们承诺了一些非常酷的机器人，

129
00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:55.803
that would run our errands or keep us company.
它们可以帮我们跑腿，与我们作伴。

130
00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:58.700
So far, we've really focused on food delivery,
到目前为止，我们专注于提供食品外卖，

131
00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:00.375
but in the future,
但是在将来，

132
00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.357
these robots can do more.
这些机器人能做到更多。

133
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:07.072
Like, they could gather excess food and bring it to shelters every night.
它们可以每晚收集过剩的食物，送到食品救济站。

134
00:07:07.413 --> 00:07:11.413
Because in America, we waste 30 percent of our food,
因为在美国，我们浪费了 30％ 的食物，

135
00:07:11.437 --> 00:07:14.965
while 10 percent of our people experience food insecurity.
而 10％ 的人口却没有食品保障。

136
00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:16.989
These robots could be part of the solution.
这些机器人可能成为解决方案的一部分。

137
00:07:17.823 --> 00:07:21.838
Or when we have hundreds of robots running around cities,
或者，当数百台机器人在城市中运行时，

138
00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:26.105
we could have robots carry emergency medications at all times,
我们可以让机器人随时携带急救药物，

139
00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:30.891
just in case someone nearby has an allergic reaction or an asthma attack.

140
00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:34.111
These robots could be on-site within a minute or two,
这些机器人可以在一两分钟之内到达现场，

141
00:07:34.135 --> 00:07:35.658
faster than anyone else.
比任何其他人都快。

142

but it hasn't learned to walk yet.

And when they do,
