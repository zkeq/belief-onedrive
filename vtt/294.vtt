1
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.249
How many people here have heard of PMS?
在座各位有多少听说过经前综合征？

2
00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.735
Everybody, right?
所有人都听说过，对吗？

3
00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:21.219
Everyone knows that women go a little crazy
大家都知道女人在月经来潮前

4
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.090
right before they get their period,
会变得有点狂躁，

5
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.278
that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster
这种生理周期将她们拋上一架无法避免的荷尔蒙过山车，

6
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.971
of irrationality and irritability.
满载着不理性和易怒。

7
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:32.759
There's a general assumption
这里有个普遍的假设，

8
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.678
that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions
就是生殖激素的波动会导致极端情绪，

9
00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:41.211
and that the great majority of women are affected by this.
大多数女性都会受此影响。

10
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.970
Well, I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says
而在这里要告诉你们，有科学证据表明，

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.389
neither of those assumptions is true.
以上假设并不成立。

12
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.612
I'm here to give you  the good news about PMS.
我来这儿是要你们带来些关于经前综合症的好消息。

13
00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:54.062
But first, let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS
但是首先，让我们来看一下经前综合征的观念

14
00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:56.454
is entrenched in American culture.
在美国文化中是多么的根深蒂固。

15
00:00:56.454 --> 00:01:00.030
If you examine newspaper or magazine articles,
如果你去查阅报刊杂志中的文章，

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.372
you'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS.
就会发现“每个女人都有经前综合征”这个假设有多么普遍。

17
00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:09.760
In an article in the magazine Redbook titled "You: PMS Free,"
REDBOOK杂志有一篇文章，标题为《你：从经前综合征解放》，

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.340
readers were informed that between 80  to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.
读者被告知80%到90%的女性都为经前综合征所扰。

19
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.071
L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers
L.A. Muscle杂志警告它的读者，

20
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:21.345
that 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from PMS,
40%到50%的女性有经前综合征，

21
00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:25.989
and that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health,
并且它主导着女性的身心健康。

22
00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.980
and a couple of years ago, even the Wall Street Journal
几年前，甚至《华尔街日报》也刊登过一篇文章，

23
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.165
ran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS,
介绍经前综合征的钙疗法，

24
00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.220
asking its female readers,
并且向其女性读者设问：

25
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.309
"Do you turn into a witch every month?"
“你每月都会变女巫吗？”

26
00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:40.686
From all these articles, you would think there must be a mountain of research
通过所有的这些文章，你可能会认为应该已经有小山一般的大量研究

27
00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:44.610
verifying the widespread nature of PMS.
证实了经前综合征普遍存在的本质。

28
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.768
However, after five decades of research,
然而，经过50年的研究，

29
00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:51.839
there's no strong consensus on the definition, the cause,
人们并没有在对经前综合征的定义、起因、疗法

30
00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:55.980
the treatment, or even  the existence of PMS.
甚至它本身是否存在等方面达成强有力的共识。

31
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.133
As most commonly defined by psychologists,
按照心理学家最常用的定义，

32
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:04.102
PMS involves negative behavioral, cognitive and physical symptoms
经前综合征包含了负面的行为、认知和身体上的一系列症状，

33
00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:07.028
from the time of ovulation to menstruation.
从排卵期延续到月经期。

34
00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:09.240
But here's where it gets tricky.
但它的棘手之处在于

35
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.481
Over 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS,
有超过150种不同的症状被用来诊断经前综合征，

36
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.571
and here are just a few of those.
这里列举了其中一些。

37
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:18.452
Now, I want to be clear here.
我想澄清一点，

38
00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:21.818
I'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms.
我不是说女性不会出现这些症状，

39
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:24.442
What I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms
而是说即使出现了其中一些症状，

40
00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:27.321
doesn't amount to a mental disorder,
也不意味着就有精神障碍，

41
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.642
and when psychologists come up with a disorder
而当心理学家提到精神障碍时，

42
00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:32.928
that's so vaguely defined,
这是一个很模糊的定义，

43
00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:36.411
the label eventually becomes meaningless.
所以这个标签也就变得毫无意义了。

44
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.383
With a list of symptoms this long and wide,
按照这么一份冗长的、涵盖甚广的症状清单，

45
00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:42.146
I could have PMS, you could have PMS,
经前综合征我可能有、你可能有、

46
00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:44.700
the guy in the third row here could have PMS,
坐第三排那位男士可能有、

47
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.393
my dog could have PMS. (Laughter)
我的狗也可能有。（笑声）

48
00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:50.681
Some researchers said you had to have five symptoms.
有些研究员说，你必须同时满足五条症状，

49
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:52.246
Some said three.
而另一些人说只要三条。

50
00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:55.102
Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful
有些研究员说，只有当那些症状严重到会

51
00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:56.936
if they were highly disturbing to you,
干扰你的正常生活时才有意义，

52
00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:00.489
but others said minor symptoms were just as important.
但另一些人又说，即使症状轻微也一样。

53
00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.480
For many years, because there was no standardization in the definition of PMS,
多年来，因为没有一个对经前综合征的标准定义，

54
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.545
when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates,
所以当心理学家尝试去报告患病率时，

55
00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:13.630
their estimates ranged from five percent of women to 97 percent of women,
他们的估算从5%到97%的女性不等，

56
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.458
so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS.
也就是说在同时，要么几乎没人有经前综合征，要么几乎人人都有。

57
00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:26.150
Overall, the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable.
总的来说，这些经前综合征的研究方法有相当大的弊端。

58
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.787
First, many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively,
首先，很多研究要求女性回溯报告她们的症状，

59
00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:34.504
looking to the past and relying on memory,
回顾过去，仰赖记忆，

60
00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:37.685
which is known to inflate reporting of PMS
我们已知这种方法会夸大事实；

61
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:41.050
compared to what's called prospective reporting,
与之相较的另一种方法叫做前瞻性报告，

62
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.246
which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms
被测者要每天记录发生的症状，

63
00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.684
for at least two months in a row.
至少持续两个月的时间。

64
00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:50.653
Many studies also exclusively focused on white, middle-class women,
还有很多研究仅关注中产阶级白人女性，

65
00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:55.299
which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women.
而把研究成果应用到所有的女性时，就会产生问题。

66
00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.337
We know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS
我们知道关于经前综合征的观点存在有很强的文化要素，

67
00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:02.959
because it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations.
因为它在西方国家之外几乎闻所未闻。

68
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.220
Third, many studies failed to use control groups.
第三，很多研究并没有使用对照组。

69
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.550
If we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have PMS,
如果我们想要了解那些患经前综合征的女性有何特征，

70
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.752
we need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS.
我们需要能够将她们与没有经前综合征的女性作对比。

71
00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:18.980
And finally, many different types of questionnaires were used
最后一点，很多不同类型的用于诊断经前综合征的调查问卷

72
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.990
to diagnose PMS, focusing on different symptoms,
聚焦于不同的症状、

73
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.643
symptom duration and severity.
症状持续的时间和严重性。

74
00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:28.754
To do reliable research on any condition,
无论在任何条件下，可靠的研究

75
00:04:28.754 --> 00:04:33.456
scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition
都要求科学家必须就构成这种条件的特征达成一致，

76
00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.569
so they're all talking about the same thing,
这样才能确保讨论的是同一个概念，

77
00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.005
and with PMS, this has not been the case.
但对于经前综合征来说，情况并非如此。

78
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:41.281
However, in 1994,
然而，在1994年，

79
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.949
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》，

80
00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.248
known as the DSM, thankfully --
又被称作DSM——

81
00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:51.126
it's also the manual for mental health professionals --
它也是一本供心理健康专业人员使用的手册——

82
00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:55.050
they redefined PMS as PMDD,
将经前综合征（PMS）重新定义为PMDD：

83
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.068
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.
即经前焦虑障碍。

84
00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:04.012
And dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease.
而其中的焦虑指的是一种烦躁或不安的情绪。

85
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.472
And according to these new DSM guidelines,
根据这些新的DSM指南，

86
00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:10.699
in most menstrual cycles in the last year,
（患有经前焦虑障碍的人）上一年大多数月经周期中

87
00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.950
at least five of 11 possible symptoms
在11种可能的症状中至少有5种

88
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.642
must appear in the week before menstruation starts;
应当出现在月经开始前的一个星期；

89
00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:21.009
the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun;
这些症状在月经开始后应当好转；

90
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.751
and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended.
然后在月经结束后一个星期内消失。

91
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.249
One of these symptoms must come from this list of four:
这些症状必须包含下列四种之一：

92
00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:35.497
marked mood swings, irritability, anxiety, or depression.
明显的情绪波动、易怒、焦虑、或抑郁。

93
00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:38.329
The other symptoms could come from the first slide
其它症状可能包含于第一张

94
00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.466
or from those on the second slide,
或者第二张幻灯片中的所列项，

95
00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:43.089
including symptoms like feeling out of control
包括感到情绪失控，

96
00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.758
and changes in sleep or appetite.
以及睡眠或胃口的改变。

97
00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:50.635
The DSM also required now that the symptoms
DSM现在还要求这些症状

98
00:05:50.635 --> 00:05:54.815
should be associated with clinically significant distress --
应该与临床上显著的痛苦相联系——

99
00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:57.648
there should be some kind of disturbance in work
应当对工作、

100
00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.573
or school or social relationships --
学习或者人际关系形成干扰——

101
00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:04.079
and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented
这些症状及其严重程度应当反映在

102
00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:08.096
by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row.
至少连续两个周期的日志记录中。

103
00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:11.951
And finally, the DSM required that the emotional disturbance
最后，DSM要求情绪障碍

104
00:06:11.951 --> 00:06:17.709
should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder.
应当不仅仅是简单的某种已经存在的障碍的恶化。

105
00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:20.495
So scientifically speaking, this is an improvement.
所以从科学上讲，这是一个进步。

106
00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:23.142
We now have a limited number of symptoms,
现在我们有了数量有限的症状，

107
00:06:23.142 --> 00:06:26.718
and a high impact on functioning that's required,
并且要求对正常生活产生显著影响，

108
00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:32.174
and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific.
对症状的描述和发生时间也做了详细规定。

109
00:06:32.174 --> 00:06:34.984
Well, using this criteria
运用这个准则，

110
00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:37.130
and looking at most recent studies,
并且参照最近的研究，

111
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.745
we see that on average,
我们看到平均来说，

112
00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:44.710
three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD.
3%到8%的女性患有经前焦虑障碍。

113
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.290
Not all women, not most women,
不是所有的女性，也不是大部分的女性，

114
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.060
not the majority of women, not even a lot of women:
不是大多数女性，甚至也不是很多女性：

115
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.746
three to eight percent.
只有3%到8%。

116
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:57.703
For everyone else, variables like stressful events or happy occasions
对其他人来说，像导致压力的事件，令人愉悦的场合，

117
00:06:57.703 --> 00:06:59.747
or even day of the week
甚至是一周当中任何一天这样的变量，

118
00:06:59.747 --> 00:07:03.832
are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month,
都是比生理期更强大的情绪预测因子，

119
00:07:03.832 --> 00:07:08.802
and this is the information the scientific community has had since the 1990s.
而这也是科学界从1990年代就已获得的信息。

120
00:07:08.802 --> 00:07:11.542
In 2002, my colleagues and I published an article
2002年，我和同事们发表了一篇文章

121
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:14.676
describing the PMS and PMDD research,
描述对经前综合征和经前焦虑障碍的研究，

122
00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:18.949
and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals.
还有其它几篇类似的文章出现在心理学期刊上。

123
00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:23.360
The questions is, why hasn't this information trickled down to the public?
问题是，为什么这些信息没有惠及大众？

124
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.936
Why do these myths persist?
为什么这些迷思仍然持续？

125
00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:30.233
Well, certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive
当然，女性从书本、电视、电影和网络上

126
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:35.377
from books, TV, movies, the Internet, that everyone gets PMS
接受到的大量的宣称每个人都会得经前综合征的信息，

127
00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:39.010
go a long way in convincing them it must be true.
对于使她们确信那就是真相起了很大的作用。

128
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.180
Research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,
研究表明，一个女性越是相信 每个人都会有经前综合征，

129
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.088
the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it.
她就越会错误地认为自己也有这种病。

130
00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:50.364
Let me tell you what I mean by "erroneously."
让我来告诉你我所说的 “错误地”是什么意思。

131
00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:53.090
You might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"
你可能会问她，“你有经前综合征吗？”

132
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.433
and she says yes,
她会回答：“是的。”

133
00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:59.250
but then, when you have her  keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months,
但是，当你检查她写的连续两个月的心理症状日志时，

134
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.316
no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month.
却无法找到这些症状跟生理期之间的关联。

135
00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:09.205
Another reason for the persistence of the PMS myth
另一个经前综合征迷思仍然持续的原因，

136
00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:12.666
has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role.
是跟女性角色的狭窄边界有关。

137
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:15.314
Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler
像琼·克莱斯勒这样的女权主义心理学家

138
00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:19.306
have suggested that taking on the label of PMS
曾经提出，贴上了经前综合征的标签后

139
00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:24.739
allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike.
可以让女性有借口表现出一些情绪，而这些情绪往往被认为是不够淑女的。

140
00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:28.130
The near universal definition of a good woman
有一个对于“好女人”的 近乎放之四海皆准的定义，

141
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.658
is one who is happy, loving, caring for others,
她要快乐、充满爱心、关心他人、

142
00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:34.514
and taking great satisfaction from that role.
并且对这种角色设定感到非常满意。

143
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:39.666
Well, PMS has become a permission slip to be angry, complain, be irritated,
这样一来，经前综合征就成为了一个允许她们正当地发怒、抱怨、烦躁，

144
00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:43.034
without losing the title of good woman.
却不会失去“好女人”的称号。

145
00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:47.074
We know that the variables in a woman's environment
我们知道一个女性所处环境的变量

146
00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:50.534
are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones,
要比她的荷尔蒙更容易导致她愤怒，

147
00:08:50.534 --> 00:08:53.390
but when she attributes anger to hormones,
但是当她把这种愤怒情绪归咎于荷尔蒙时，

148
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.157
she's absolved of responsibility or criticism.
就无须为此负责，还能避免批评。

149
00:08:56.157 --> 00:08:59.610
"Oh, that's not who she is. It's out of her control."
“哦，那不是真正的她，她控制不了。”

150
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:06.226
And while this can be a useful tool, it serves to invalidate women's emotions.
尽管这可以当做一种实用工具，实际上却否定了女性的情绪。

151
00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:08.947
When people respond to a woman's anger
当人们对一个女性的愤怒作出回应时，

152
00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:11.942
with the thought, "Oh, it's just that time of the month,"
他会想，“噢，这只是生理期的原因。”

153
00:09:11.942 --> 00:09:17.300
her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited.
她通常就不会被认真对待，也不太可能会发生有益的改变。

154
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.287
So who else benefits from the myth of PMS?
那么还有谁能从经前综合征的迷思中获益呢？

155
00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:23.331
Well, I can tell you that treating PMS
我可以告诉你们，经前综合征的治疗

156
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:27.812
has become a profitable,  thriving industry.
已经发展成一个有利可图、蓬勃发展的行业。

157
00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:34.592
Amazon.com currently offers over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.
目前，亚马逊网站上有超过1900种关于治疗经前综合征的书籍在售。

158
00:09:34.592 --> 00:09:37.053
A quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia
通过谷歌，可以很快搜索出一箩筐的信息，

159
00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:40.791
of clinics, workshops and seminars.
全是关于诊所、讲习所和研讨会的。

160
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:43.694
Reputable Internet sources of medical information
那些著名的医学信息资源网站

161
00:09:43.694 --> 00:09:48.454
like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder.
如“网络医生”、“梅约诊所”都将经前综合征列为一种已知的精神障碍。

162
00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:50.961
It's not a known disorder, but they list it.
它不是一种已知的精神障碍，却被列为一种。

163
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:54.932
And they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it,
他们还列出了内科医生治疗经前综合征的处方药，

164
00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:57.868
like anti-depressants or hormones.
比如抗抑郁剂或者激素。

165
00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:03.592
Interestingly, though, both websites say that the success of medication
有趣的是，这两家网站都表示药物治疗经前综合征的

166
00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:07.679
in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman.
成功率因人而异。

167
00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:09.410
Well, that doesn't make sense.
而这完全不合常理。

168
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.044
If you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause,
如果你得了一种由确切原因导致的明显的精神疾病，

169
00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.994
which PMS is supposed to be,
假设那就是“经前综合征”，

170
00:10:13.994 --> 00:10:17.802
then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women.
那么针对它的治疗方法应该为大量的女性带来病情改善。

171
00:10:17.802 --> 00:10:20.356
This has not been the case with these treatments,
但是对于经前综合征的这些治疗方法却并不是这么回事，

172
00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:24.466
and FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective,
而且，美国食品和药品管理局的法规规定，如果要认定一种药物有效，

173
00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:26.533
a large portion of the target population
那么它的目标人群中的很大一部分，

174
00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:29.691
should see clinically significant improvement.
应当有临床上的显著改善。

175
00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:33.707
So we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments.
而我们从经前综合征的所谓“治疗”上并未看到上述效果。

176
00:10:33.707 --> 00:10:41.021
However, the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that PMS is a common mental disorder
然而，坚持宣扬经前综合征是一种可治疗的普遍的精神疾病这一谬见，

177
00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:45.090
and is treatable is quite substantial.
所获得的经济收益是巨大的。

178
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.544
When women are prescribed drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,
当女性服用抗抑郁剂或激素等处方药时，

179
00:10:48.544 --> 00:10:53.653
medical protocol requires that they have physician follow-up every three months.
医疗协议要求她们每三个月复诊，

180
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.626
That's a lot of doctor visits.
那是一个很大的就医量。

181
00:10:55.626 --> 00:10:58.134
Pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits
医药企业能获取数不清的利润，

182
00:10:58.134 --> 00:11:02.058
when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication
只要女人们相信她们应该在

183
00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.960
for all of their child-bearing lives.
整个怀孕期间服用处方药。

184
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.584
Over-the-counter drugs like Midol
非处方药像痛经药Midol

185
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:11.996
even claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability,
甚至声称能够治疗像紧张和易怒这样的经前综合征症状，

186
00:11:11.996 --> 00:11:17.963
even though they only contain a diuretic, a pain reliever and caffeine.
尽管它们只含有利尿剂、止痛剂和咖啡因。

187
00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:21.399
Now, far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine,
我没有立场去争论咖啡因的神奇力量，

188
00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:25.764
but I don't think reducing tension is one of them.
但我并不认为它有缓解紧张的作用。

189
00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:32.330
Since 2002, Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents.
自2002年以来，Midol为青少年市场开发了适用的产品，

190
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.160
They are aiming at young girls early,
他们早早的就瞄准了年轻女孩，

191
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.405
to convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster,
说服她们相信每个人都会得经前综合征，那会使你变成一个怪物，

192
00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:41.684
but wait, there's something you can do about it:
但是等一等，你还是有救的：

193
00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:44.746
Take Midol and you will be a human being again.
服用Midol，就会变回正常人。

194
00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:51.270
In 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars in sales revenue.
2013年， Midol获得了4800万美元的销售收入。

195
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.920
So while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some,
维持关于经前综合征的迷思对某些机构来说是有利可图的，

196
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.140
it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women.
但是对女性自己则会产生严重的不良后果。

197
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.364
First, it contributes to the medicalization of women's reproductive health.
首先，它会导致女性生殖健康的医疗化。

198
00:12:05.364 --> 00:12:08.568
The medical field has a long history of conceptualizing
医疗领域有一个很长的历史，

199
00:12:08.568 --> 00:12:13.978
women's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment,
将女性的生殖过程概念化为一个需要治疗的疾病，

200
00:12:13.978 --> 00:12:18.088
and this has come at many costs, including excessive Cesarean deliveries,
这样就会产生很多的花费，包括过度的剖腹产手术、

201
00:12:18.088 --> 00:12:20.798
hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments
子宫切除和指定的激素治疗，

202
00:12:20.798 --> 00:12:24.825
that have harmed rather than enhanced women's health.
而这对女性的健康来说有百害而无一利。

203
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:30.325
Second, the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women
第二，经前综合征的迷思对女性

204
00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:33.691
as irrational and overemotional.
不理性和过度情绪化的刻板印象的形成有所助益。

205
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:40.250
When the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts,
当生理周期被描述成将女性变成愤怒的野兽的荷尔蒙过山车时，

206
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.595
it becomes easy to question  the competence of all women.
就会很容易让人去怀疑所有女性的能力。

207
00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:47.414
Women have made tremendous strides in the workforce,
女性在职场上取得了巨大的进步，

208
00:12:47.414 --> 00:12:51.477
but still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons
但是在政府或者企业的高层职位中

209
00:12:51.477 --> 00:12:54.217
of fields like government or business,
女性的数量仍然微不足道，

210
00:12:54.217 --> 00:12:59.163
and when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator,
当我们思考谁能成为一个好的CEO或者议员，

211
00:12:59.163 --> 00:13:05.791
someone who has qualities like  rationality, steadiness, competence come to mind,
那些拥有理性、稳重、能力等素质的人会出现在我们脑海中，

212
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:09.332
and in our culture, that sounds more like a man than a woman,
而在我们的文化中，男性听起来更符合这些条件，

213
00:13:09.332 --> 00:13:12.990
and the PMS myth contributes to that.
而经前综合征的迷思正是导致这种认知的原因之一。

214
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:18.992
Psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different.
心理学家认为男性和女性情绪上的相同之处多过差异。

215
00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:23.055
One study followed men and women for four to six months
有一项研究对男性和女性进行了4到6个月的跟踪，

216
00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:26.120
and found that the number of mood swings they experienced
发现他们经历的情绪波动的次数

217
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.974
and the severity of those mood swings were no different.
和严重性并没有什么不同。

218
00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:34.177
And finally, the PMS myth keeps women from dealing
最后，经前综合征迷思妨碍到女性处理

219
00:13:34.177 --> 00:13:38.194
with the actual issues causing them emotional upset.
那些造成她们心烦意乱的症结问题。

220
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:42.619
Individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions
人际关系和工作环境的质量等个人问题，

221
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:47.133
or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty
或者种族主义、性别歧视、贫困折磨等社会问题，

222
00:13:47.133 --> 00:13:50.477
are all strongly related to daily mood.
都跟每天的情绪有密切关联。

223
00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:54.240
Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS
用经前综合征来逃避情绪问题，

224
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.092
keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions,
限制了女性去了解她们负面情绪的来源，

225
00:13:58.092 --> 00:14:03.460
but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them.
同时也夺走了她们采取行动去做出改变的机会。

226
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.289
So the good news about PMS
所以关于经前综合征的好消息是

227
00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:11.025
is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle,
虽然一些女性会因为生理周期而出现一些症状，

228
00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:14.578
the great majority don't get a mental disorder.
但大多数的女性并不因此而患精神疾病。

229
00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:17.805
They go to work or school, take care of their families,
她们照样工作、上学、照顾家庭，

230
00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:20.104
and function at a normal level.
一切如常。

231
00:14:20.104 --> 00:14:23.331
We know the emotions and moods of men and women
我们知道男性与女性的情绪和心情

232
00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:25.282
are more similar than different,
极为相近，

233
00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:30.902
so let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches
那么就让我们从陈腐的视女性为巫婆的经前综合征迷思中走出来，

234
00:14:30.917 --> 00:14:35.765
and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning
而去接受大多数女性每天都过着情绪高涨、专业有序，

235
00:14:35.765 --> 00:14:38.969
the great majority of women live every day.
运转正常的生活这一事实。

236
00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:41.245
Thank you.
谢谢。

237
00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:43.357
(Applause)
