I was just talking about the things that I cared about,

with so many notifications on my phone,

It was the craziest thing, guys,

but when it came to my influence and my exposure,

was often the most divisive subject in American life,

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.236
but it was the way that I articulated race

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.620
that made me somewhat of a digital lightning rod.
让我在某种程度上成为了数字避雷针。

20
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.396
See, being a survivor myself of police brutality

21

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.796
I had a little something to say about the topic.
我觉得在这个话题上，我有一点话语权。

25
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.196
You see, this was at the height of the Black Lives Matter furor
这很明显是涉及“黑人的命也是命”运动的大事，

26
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.476
and people seemed to be turning to me to articulate their viewpoints,

27
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.476
and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.
说实话，这有些过分了。

28

You see, the internet has this interesting quality.

29
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.276
In one way, it totally brought the world together,

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.956
and I remember being a kid
我记得孩童时期，

31
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.156
and all of this utopian propaganda was being dumped on us

about how the World Wide Web

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020
was going to span the reaches of people across the globe.

But as it turns out, people are people.

35
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.116
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.996
And this magical superhighway

37
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.916
also took the demons of our nature

38
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.556
and gave them Ferraris.

39
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.116
(Laughter)
（笑声）

40
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.836
You see, technology, y'all, is a lot like money.
其实科技跟金钱很相似，

41
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.436
It just brings out what's already inside you and amplifies it.
它引出了你内心本来就存在的东西，并且将其放大，

42
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.740
And so I soon became familiar with the phenomenon of the internet troll.
不久，我就对“互联网喷子”这个现象比较熟悉了。

43
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.835
These guys seem to live beneath the bridges of said superhighway --
这些人就像住在所谓的“超级公路”的桥洞里——

44
00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.596
(Laughter)
（笑声）

45
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.820
And they also missed the memo about the enlightenment of the internet age.
他们也错过了关于互联网时代启蒙思想的备忘录。

46
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.636
I remember being called

47
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.860
highly colorful racial slurs by those who use the anonymity of the internet as a Klan hood.
一些匿名称自己为 3K 党的人说我是极端种族歧视诽谤者。

And some of them were pretty creative, actually,
不得不说，他们中有些人还是非常有创造力的，

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.276
but others were pretty wounding,

50
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.076
especially navigating the post-traumatic world
尤其是在“黑人的命也是命”的鼎盛时期，

51

of a police brutality survivor in the height of Black Lives Matter,

52
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.756
with all of these people being killed on my timeline.

53
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.956
To these trolls, I wasn't a human.

54
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.396
I was an idea, an object,
我只是一种想法，一个物体，

55
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.796
a caricature.
一幅讽刺画。

56
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.996
Did I mention that this race stuff can be kind of divisive?
我提到过种族事件在某种程度上是分裂的吗？

57
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.876
You see, I'm an innately curious person
要知道，我是个生来就充满好奇心的人，

58
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.796
and as I drew my sword to engage in epic battles in the comment section --
而且我已经准备好了武器，决定投入到评论区的史诗级战斗中——

59
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.140
(Laughter)
（笑声）

60
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.116
I also began to notice

61
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.596
that a few of my trolls actually had brains,
我面对的一些喷子中，有些人其实是有脑子的，

62
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.516
which made me even more curious and what to understand them even further.
这让我更加好奇，想更深入的了解他们。

63
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.916
And although these supposed morons engaged in what appeared to be original thought,
尽管这些我所认为的傻瓜都有一些原创的思想，

64
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.796
I said to myself,
我对自己说，

65
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.516
"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,
“哦，在我看来，这些人

66
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.260
at least according to my knowledge."
其实是被极大程度的误导了。”

67
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.356
Where are these guys getting these arguments from?
这些人从哪里得到的这些观点呢？

68
00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:50.576
Like, was there some kind of alternative universe with alternative facts?
是有个平行宇宙中存在着平行的事实吗？

69
00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:53.996
(Laughter)
（笑声）

70
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.980
(Applause)
（掌声）

71
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.636
Was history and gravity optional over there?

72
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.860
I don't know.
我不知道。

73
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.676
But I needed to know. Like, I wanted to know.
但是我需要知道，我也想知道到底是怎么回事。

74
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.076
And as it turns out, I had no idea about digital echo chambers.
结果证明，我对数字回音室一无所知。

75
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.796
That same target marketing algorithm that feeds you more of the products you like to buy
那些为你提供更多你想购买的产品的目标营销算法，

76
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.916
also feeds you more of the news that you like to hear.
同时也会推送给你更多你乐于听到的新闻。

77
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.315
I had been living in an online universe that just reflected my worldview back to me.
我曾生活在一个能够反射我的世界观的网络世界。

78
00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.156
So my timeline was pretty liberal.

79
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.036
I had no Breitbart or Infowars or Fox News.
我不看 Breibart，Infowars，或者 Fox News（均为右翼新闻媒体）。

80
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.500
No, no, I was all MSNBC and The Daily Show,
不，不，我看的都是微软有线电视（MSNBC）、每日秀、

81
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.316
CNN and theGrio, right?
有线电视新闻（CNN）和格里奥新闻网（theGrio）（均为左翼媒体）。

82
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.196
Well, these trolls were hopping the dimensional doorway
这些喷子曾越过了空间的门户，

83
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.276
and I needed to figure out how.
而我想知道他们是如何做到的。

84
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.580
(Laughter)
（笑声）

85
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.516
So what I decided to do was trick the Facebook algorithm
所以我决定调戏 Facebook 的算法，

86
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.876
into feeding me more news that I didn't necessarily agree with,
好让它给我推送更多我不是很认同的新闻。

87
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.716
and this worked fine for a while, but it wasn't enough,
在一段时间内它运行得很好，但是这还不够，

88
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.116
because my online footprint already established the patterns that I like to hear.
因为我的网上记录已经确立了我的收听习惯。

89
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.756
So with the anonymity of the internet,
所以在网络匿名制度下，

90
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.996
I went undercover.
我开始了暗中操作。

91
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.356
(Laughter)
（笑声）

92
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.140
I set up this ghost profile and went crazy.
我建立了虚假的资料，做出了反常的举动。

93
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.956
Now, on a practical level, it was very simple,
在操作上，这是非常简单的，

94
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.756
but on an emotional level, it was kind of daunting,

95
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.196
especially with the racist vitriol that I had experienced.
尤其因为我经历过的种族主义尖酸刻薄。

96
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.676
But what I didn't realize is that my trolls were inoculating me,
但我没有意识到，正是这些喷子给我打了“预防针”，

97
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.316
thickening my skin,
让我变得坚不可摧，

98
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.156
making me immune to viewpoints that I didn't necessarily agree with,
让我对一些本来不是很同意的观点产生了免疫力，

99
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.556
and so I didn't react to the same things as I would have several months prior.
所以对于同一件事，我的反应和几个月前完全不同。

100
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.236
All right? So I pressed on.
所以我坚持了下来。

101
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.116
Noticing that this stuff also worked on YouTube,
注意到这些做法在YouTube上也同样有效之后，

102
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.156
I became Lucius25, white supremacist lurker --
于是我成了“Lucius25”，一位白人至上主义者——

103
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.180
(Laughter)
（笑声）

104
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.340
And digitally I began to infiltrate the infamous alt-right movement.
然后我在网上开始潜入臭名昭著的极右派运动。

105
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.836
Now, my doppelgänger
我现在是埃德加·赖斯·巴勒斯（美国著名科幻小说家）

106
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.516
was Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter character --
笔下的约翰·卡特（科幻电影《异星战场》主角） ——

107
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.196
(Laughter)
（笑声）

108
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.300
a sci-fi hero who was once a Confederate soldier.
一个曾经是联盟士兵的科幻英雄。

109
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.636
And to think, like, years ago, I would have needed acting training
我想，如果在几年前，我会需要进行一些表演训练，

110
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.556
and, like, makeup and a fake ID.
还需要比如化妆和假身份证。

111
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.020
Now I could just lurk.
现在我只需要潜伏就好了。

112
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.396
And so I started with a little Infowars,
于是我先从Infowars网站开始，

113
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.156
went on into some American Renaissance, National Vanguard Alliance,
然后涉足了“美国复兴”和 “全国先锋联盟” （均为白人至上种族主义组织），

114
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.036
and, you know, I started commenting on videos,
并且我还开始评论视频，

115
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.820
talking bad about Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter.
说阿尔·夏普顿（非裔民权运动领袖）和“黑人的命也是命”这一运动的坏话。

116
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.020
I started bemoaning race baiters like Eric Holder and Barack Obama
我为埃里克·霍尔德（非裔民主党政治家）和奥巴马这样的种族煽动者感到惋惜，

117
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.476
and just mirroring the antiblack sentiments that were thrown at me.
这也映射了当时人们对我的反黑人情绪。

118
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.236
And to be honest, it was kind of exhilarating.
老实说，我还觉得挺兴奋的。

119
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.316
(Laughter)
（笑声）

120
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.556
Like, I would literally spend days clicking through my new racist profile --
我还花了几天时间修改我的新种族主义简介——

121
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.756
(Laughter)
（笑声）

122
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.996
Goofing off at work in Aryan land. It was something else.
在雅利安人的地盘上开小差，这又是另外一回事了。

123
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.156
(Laughter)
（笑声）

124
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.516
And so I then started visiting some of the pages of my former trolls,
于是我开始浏览一些以前的网络喷子的网页，

125
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.316
and a lot of these guys were just regular Joes,
我发现其中很多人都只是普通百姓——

126
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.116
a lot of outdoorsmen, hunters, computer nerds,
户外爱好者、猎人、痴迷计算机的人，

127
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.276
some of them family guys with videos of their families.
还有人的网页上有温馨的家庭视频。

128
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.920
I mean, for all I know, some of y'all could be in this room right now. Right?
说不准他们中的一员可能现在就在这个房间里。

129
00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:43.236
(Laughter)
（笑声）

130
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.356
But when I went undercover, I found a lovely plethora of characters,
但是在卧底期间，我也发现了一群可爱的角色，

131
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.396
luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and David Duke.
像米洛·扬诺普洛斯、理查德·斯宾塞和大卫·杜克这样的名人。

132
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.756
All of these guys were thought leaders in their own right,
所有这些人都凭借自身的能力成为了思想领袖，

133
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:04.196
but over time, the alt-right movement ended up using their information to fuel their momentum.
但随着时间的推移，另类右翼运动最终只是利用了他们的信息来为自己造势。

134
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.676
And I'm going to tell you what else led to the momentum of the alt-right:
我还要告诉大家，还有什么导致了另类右翼运动：

135
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.436
the left wing's wholesale demonization of everything white and male.
那就是左翼党大规模地妖魔化了所有的白人和男性——

136
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.156
If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver, you're in league with Satan.
如果你有一个白皙的生殖器，那你就是撒旦的同盟。

137
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.180
(Laughter)
（笑声）

138
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:30.020
Now, would you believe, would you believe that some people find that offensive?
你们相信有些人会觉得这样是很冒犯人的吗？

139
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.436
And --
并且——

140
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.596
(Laughter)
（笑声）

141
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.356
And so, I mean, listen,
我想说的是，

142
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.836
the fact is that millennials get a lifetime of diet brand history.
事实上，千禧一代的人一生所见的都是简化的历史。

143
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:49.636
I mean, America seems to be hellbent on filling its textbooks with CliffsNotes versions of its dark past.
美国似乎拼命地要把教科书装满学习指南系列丛书里那种简化了的黑暗的美国历史。

144
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:59.156
This severely, severely decontextualizes race and the anger associated with it, and that is fertile ground for alt-facts to grow.
这种严重的去情境化，和对历史和愤怒的排斥催生了另类右翼势力的滋长。

145
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.196
Add in the wild landscape of the internet
再加上自由的网络环境，

146
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.516
and it's easy to sell rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas
很容易就能把《我的奋斗》这样的思想

147
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.260
to a generation who has been failed by public schools.
灌输给在公立学校没有接受到正确教育的一代人。

148
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.876
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.
很多这类想法其实很容易被驳斥。

149
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.756
Alt-facts have that quality.
另类事实有这样的特质。

150
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:20.116
However, one theme kept screaming at me through the subtext of those arguments,
然而，有个问题一直透过这些论点的潜台词向我质询，

151
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.036
and that was,
那就是，

152
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.060
why should I be hated for who I cannot help but be?
我无法选择我的出身，为什么我要因此而被痛恨？

153
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.156
Now, as a black man in America, that resonated with me.
身为在美国的黑人，这一点在我的内心产生了共鸣。

154
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.196
I have spent so much time
我花了这么多时间，

155
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.036
defending myself against attempts to demonize me
进行自我防御，反抗将我妖魔化

156
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.396
and make me apologize for who I am,
和要我为自己的出身道歉的行为，

157
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.636
trying to portray me as something that I'm not,
反对他们将我描述成一个跟我截然不同的人，

158
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.220
some kind of thug or gangster, a menace to society.
某种混混、帮派份子、对社会的威胁。

159
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.620
Unexpected compassion.
这个问题体现了多么令人意外的同理心。

160
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.596
Wow.
哇。

161
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.156
Now, listen,
请仔细听我说，

162
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:53.116
the historical source of the demonization of black males and white males is highly different,
黑人男性和白人男性被妖魔化的历史来源是非常不同的，

163
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.636
and where you fall on this argument,
当你落入这个论点时，

164
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.020
sadly, tends to be an accident of birth.
很遗憾，这通常是出生的造化。

165
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.236
Now, you're probably surprised by this perspective,
你可能会对这个观点感到惊讶，

166
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.460
and so was I.
我也是。

167
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:10.300
Never in a billion years did I think that I could have some kind of compassion for people who hated my guts.
我从来没有想过我会得到恨我入骨的人对我的同情。

168
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.036
Now, mind you, not enough compassion like I want to be friends.
请注意，这种同情并没有达到想让我与他们交朋友的程度。

169
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.236
I don't have infinite olive branches to extend to people
我并没有那么多橄榄枝去递给

170
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.036
who, like, would not want to see me on this planet. Right?
那些不想在地球上看到我的人，对吧？

171
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.836
But just enough compassion to understand how they got to where they are.
但这种适度的同情，刚好可以帮助我了解他们是如何走到现在这一步的。

172
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.196
And to be honest,
老实说，

173
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.276
there were a couple of fair points.
有几个观点还是挺合理的。

174
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.796
One of them was how liberals have this wide acceptance for everybody
其中一个是，自由主义者对于每个人都有广泛的接受度，

175
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.036
except for those with honestly held conservative viewpoints.
除了那些观点保守的人。

176
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.676
(Laughter)
（笑声）

177
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.140
Heaven forbid you love God, this country and mean it. Right?
但愿你不会真心的爱上帝，爱这个国家。对吧？

178
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.027
And another thing that 
他们谈论的另一件事是，

179
00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:52.276
they talked about was this fear that they had of something that they labeled as "white genocide,"
他们对所谓的“白人大屠杀”的恐惧，

180
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.500
that diversity would be a force that would wipe them out.
多样性会形成一股力量，足以将他们铲除。

181
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.036
Now listen, I know what it is to fear for the fate of your people.
听我说，我知道为了你的族人的命运而恐惧是怎样的感觉。

182
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.996
Between crack, AIDS, gang violence,
在古柯碱、艾滋病、帮派暴力、

183
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.196
mass incarceration, gentrification, police shootings,
大规模监禁、士绅化及被警方枪击的阴影下，

184
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.180
black people have more than enough reasons to stay up at night.
黑人在晚上也无法入眠是非常合理的会。

185
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.636
But if nature is into diversity and you are not,
但如果大自然会慷慨的拥抱多样性，而你却不——

186
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.956
you're going to lose that fight, buddy.
老兄，那你就玩儿完了。

187
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.796
(Laughter)
（笑声）

188
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.940
(Applause)
（掌声）

189
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.236
You see, nature doesn't care about your race. That's man-made.
要知道，大自然不在乎你的种族，那是人为定义的。

190
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.316
Nature just cares about healthy organisms,
大自然只关心健康的有机体，

191
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.620
and your precious ethnic features are expendable to that aim.
对于那个目标而言，你珍贵的民族特征是无足轻重的。

192
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:42.716
So the moment that you let go of that racist identity and relatch onto humanity,
所以，当你放下种族主义身份并重新理解人性的时候，

193
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.276
all your problems go away.
你所有的问题都会消失。

194
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.180
(Applause)
（掌声）

195
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.876
I'm going to tell you what race ain't about to die out:
我要告诉各位，哪个种族不会灭绝：

196
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.116
the human race.
那就是整个人类族群。

197
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.780
Join the party. The water's great.
加入人类的大家庭，趁着大家相处还比较融洽，

198
00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:02.236
Until the water gets too hot, but that's another TED Talk.
要是哪天气氛不对了——但那就是另一个 TED 演讲要讨论的了。

199
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.020
(Laughter)
（笑声）

200
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.636
The point is that to get to this point of understanding,
重点是，若要达到这种程度的理解，

201
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.436
you have to let go of that fear
你得放下恐惧，

202
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.156
and embrace your curiosity,
拥抱你的好奇心。

203
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.636
and sadly, too many people will not take that journey
然而可惜的是，太多人不愿踏上这趟旅程，

204
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.676
to see the world from the other side.
从另一侧看待这个世界。

205
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.276
And, I mean, let's be honest,
坦白说，

206
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.436
that doesn't just go for progressives,
不仅很多改革派是这样，

207
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.716
but also to the right wing and conservatives.
右翼和保守份子也同样如此。

208
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.956
You know, as fair as some of their points were,
虽然他们的一些观点很有道理，

209
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.396
they were still trapped in their own echo chambers,
但他们始终被困在自己的回声室里，

210
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.796
recycling old, outdated points of view,
不断重复着老旧、过时的观点，

211
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.356
never getting a diversity in perspective,
永远不能获得多样化的视角，

212
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.116
not making them well-rounded in their worldview.
他们的世界观也就无法得到补充和完善。

213
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.956
So they're not hearing certain anti-racist and political voices,
所以，他们听不见某些反种族主义和政治人士的呼吁，

214
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.956
voices like Tim Wise
比如蒂姆·怀斯、米歇尔·亚历山大、

215
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:51.436
and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.
乔伊·迪葛莱、博伊斯·瓦特金斯和塔瑞克·纳希德（均为民权活动人士）。

216
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.396
All of these voices have the answers to the questions that they want,
所有这些声音都包含了他们想要的问题的答案，

217
00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.236
but unfortunately they will not hear them due to the power of these echo chambers.
但不幸的是，由于回声室的力量，他们听不见。

218
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.916
We have got to break out of these digital divides,
我们需要摆脱这些数字化的分歧，

219
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.556
because as our technology advances,
因为随着科技的进步，

220
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.076
the consequences of our tribalism become more dangerous.
部落化的意识会带来非常危险的后果。

221
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.716
And this whole experience taught me something:
这一整段经历教会了我一件事：

222
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.580
our gadgets ain't going to save us.
这些高科技小玩意儿无法拯救我们。

223
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.156
All these technological devices
所有这些技术装置

224
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.876
are only mastery of the universe out there, not the one in here.
只能掌控外面的宇宙，而非里面的这个。

225
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.156
And so that's all IQ, not EQ.
它们反映的都是智商，不是情商。

226
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.996
That's a dangerous imbalance.
这是一种危险的失衡。

227
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.836
Where do you get the emotional intelligence,
你从哪里得到情商、

228
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.716
the character development,
性格发展、

229
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.436
the virtues of patience, forbearance, compassion,
耐心、宽容和同情的美德？

230
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.636
you know, the things that make sure that these devices, however advanced,
正是这些东西在确保无论这些装置多先进，

231
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.580
become a blessing and not a curse?
也只会是对人类的福赐，而非诅咒。

232
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.340
Seems to be me that humanity itself needs an upgrade.
就我看来，人性本身也需要升级。

233
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.756
Now --
所以——

234
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.636
(Applause)
（掌声）

235
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.316
That's a big task, understandably,
很明显，那是一项艰巨的任务，

236
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.076
but I don't believe in any kind of unbeatable monster.
但我不相信任何一种打不败的怪兽。

237
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.356
There was no giant out there without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.
任何一个怪兽都有自己的“阿喀琉斯之踵”（即弱点）。

238
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.716
And what if I told you
如果我告诉你们，

239
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.516
that one of the best ways to actually overcome this
克服这个问题最好的方式之一，

240
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.996
is to have courageous conversations with difficult people,
就是和“难搞的人”，也就是和你用不同方式看世界的人

241
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.436
people who do not see the world the same way that you see the world?
进行大胆的交谈，结果会怎样？

242
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.316
Oh yes, folks, conversations may be indeed the key to that upgrade,
是的各位，交谈可能就是升级的关键，

243
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.876
because remember,
因为，切记，

244
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.916
language was the first form of virtual reality.
语言是虚拟现实的第一种形式。

245
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.036
It is literally a symbolic representation of the physical world,
它其实就是物质世界的一种符号表征，

246
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.116
and through this device, we change the physical world.
透过这个装置，我们能改变物质世界。

247
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.276
Keep in mind, conversations stop violence,
请牢记，交谈能阻止暴力，

248
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.436
conversations start countries,
交谈是国家的开始，

249
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.716
they build bridges,
它们能建立桥梁。

250
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.276
and when the chips are down,
当电子设备失效的时候，

251
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.460
conversations are the last tools that humans use before they pick up their guns.
交谈就是人类在拿起枪支之前所能使用的最后工具。

252
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.556
And I ain't talking about online safe conversations from the security of your laptop.
我说的并不是用电脑在网络上进行安全的交谈。

253
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.996
No.
不是。

254
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.716
I'm talking about in-your-face conversations with real, breathing people.
我指的是面对面的交谈，和会呼吸的真人交谈。

255
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.956
And for me, this looks like running a community forum
对我来说，这就像是在经营一个社群论坛，

256
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.876
called Shop Talk Live.
叫做“Shop Talk Live”。

257
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.500
Now, in Shop Talk Live -- somebody's been there, right?
有人去过，对吧？

258
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.436
In Shop Talk Live,
在“Shop Talk Live”中，

259
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.916
we have the conversations that change lives.
会诞生能改变人生的交谈。

260
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.716
We meet the community right where they are,
我们直接走进社区，

261
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.156
and we've done everything from divert gang violence in real time
我们做过各种尝试，从实时转移帮派暴力，

262
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.836
to help find people jobs
到帮助人们找到工作，

263
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.996
to mentoring homeless youth.
再到辅导无家可归的青年。

264
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.916
And the reason why we needed to do this
我们需要这么做的理由，

265
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:32.236
is because there was a severe lack of trust in the black community due to the violence of the crack era.
是因为古柯碱时代的暴力造成了黑人社区中非常缺乏信任。

266
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.516
And so we ended up taking agency into our own hands,
所以我们最终把代理权交给了我们自己，

267
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.076
solving our own problems,
解决我们自己的问题，

268
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.156
not waiting for anybody else.
不寄希望于其他人。

269
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.396
And the truth is,
而事实是，

270
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.796
from the mayor to the felon,
无论是市长还是罪犯，

271
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.996
you're going to find them in that barber shop.
你都可以在理发店找到他们。

272
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.036
And so what we did was just organize what was already going on.
所以我们所做的只是把已经发生的事组织起来。

273
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:53.116
And so what I started doing was mining these alternative viewpoints from these alternative digital universes,
我开始“开采”这些来自平行数字宇宙的这些平行观点，

274
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.676
dissecting them, breaking them down into controversial talking points.
解析它们，把它们分解成有争议的讨论话题。

275
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.276
Then, with my cell phone,
然后，我通过手机

276
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.356
I flipped the internet against itself
翻转了网络，让它对抗它自己，

277
