31

Why can't we talk about periods?

38
00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:56.838
there would be an ear, nose and throat surgeon up here right now,

talking about the taboos of nose bleeds, right?

And it's not even about periods,

46
00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:20.338
It's just a patriarchal society is invested in oppressing women,

and at different points in our lives, different things are used.

It's been around since pretty much the beginning of time,

many cultures thought that women could spoil crops

purity myths only made that worse.

there was the idea that women elaborated something called a menotoxin.

(Laughter)

00:02:53.237 --> 00:02:55.963
And that's what happens when there's no diversity, right.
这是在多样化缺失时 会发生的事，对吧？

61
00:02:55.987 --> 00:02:58.504
Because there was no woman to put her hand up and go,
因为那时没有女性 举起手，走上前并说

62
00:02:57.832 --> 00:03:00.940
"Well, actually, that doesn't happen."

64
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.838

Because you don't even need to be a doctor

66
00:03:08.903 --> 00:03:10.796
to say that periods aren't toxic.

67
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.528
If they were, why would an embryo implant in a toxic swill?
如果月经是有毒的，为什么胚胎 会扎根于这样一个有毒的环境？

68
00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:20.088
And if we all had this secret menotoxin,

69
00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.251
we could be laying waste to crops and spoiling milk.

70

(Laughter)
（笑声）

71
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:28.421
Why would we have not used our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner?
我们为什么还没用自己 X 女战警的能力更快地获得更多选票？

72
00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:30.629
(Laughter)

78
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.632
I mention that it affects 28 percent of women.

79
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.504
And every single time, someone approaches me and says,

80
00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:52.671
"I thought I was the only one."

81
00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:55.338
That's how effective that culture of shame is,

82
00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:59.129
that women can't even share their experiences.

83

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:03.963
"Well, what if everybody knew about periods like a gynecologist?

you'd know that menstruation

to start producing an egg.

cell upon cell, like bricks.

which is progestational, it gets the uterus ready.

lining comes out,

that choice comes from the ovary.

(Cheering and applause)

如果你没有怀孕，为什么那些东西 不可以在我们体内随意逗留？

00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:59.504
We can't reabsorb it, because it's too much.

132
00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:02.629

But evolution knows about risk-benefit ratio.

145
00:06:38.403 --> 00:06:40.588
You try to get the highest quality embryos.
你尝试保留最高质量的那个胚胎。

146
00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:42.838
And how do you get the highest quality embryos?
那你如何尝试保留 最高质量的胚胎呢？

147
00:06:42.862 --> 00:06:44.713
You make them work for it.
你让它们为此奋斗。

148
00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.171
You give them an obstacle course.
你给它们一个需要通过的障碍。

149
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.356
So over the millennia that we have evolved,
所以经过上千年的进化，

150
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.213
it's been a little bit like an arms race in the uterus,
子宫内的竞争 宛如一场军备竞赛，

151
00:06:53.237 --> 00:06:55.713
the lining getting thicker and thicker and thicker,
内膜变得越来越厚，

152
00:06:55.737 --> 00:06:57.504
and the embryo getting more invasive
胚胎也更具侵入性，

153
00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:59.005
until we reach this détente
直至与子宫内膜的关系

154
00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:01.749
with the lining of the uterus that we have.
达到一个缓和状态。

155
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.546
So we have this thick uterine lining
所以我们有了 这层厚厚的子宫内膜，

156
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.754
and now it's got to come out,
它现在需要被排出体外，

157
00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:07.879
and how do you stop bleeding?
但是你是如何停止流血的？

158
00:07:07.903 --> 00:07:10.296
Well, you stop a nose bleed by pinching it,
通常流鼻血的话， 你会捏住鼻子止血，

159
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.629
if you cut your leg, you put pressure on it.
如果你划到腿了， 你会加压止血。

160
00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:14.504
We stop bleeding with pressure.
压力能够帮助止血。

161
00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:16.129
When we menstruate,
当我们来月经的时候，

162
00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:18.254
the lining of the uterus releases substances
子宫内膜会释放一种物质，

163
00:07:18.278 --> 00:07:21.296
that are made into chemicals called prostaglandins
它能够生成一种 名为前列腺素的化学物质

164
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.546
and other inflammatory mediators.
以及其它炎症介质。

165
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.588
And they make the uterus cramp down,
它们会造成子宫向下筋挛，

166
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.671
they make it squeeze on those blood vessels
使子宫对血管造成压力

167
00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:29.379
to stop the bleeding.
从而起到止血作用。

168
00:07:29.403 --> 00:07:31.594
They might also change blood flow to the uterus
它们也可能会让血流向子宫，

169
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.671
and also cause inflammation and that makes pain worse.
同时引发炎症，并加剧疼痛感。

170
00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:38.171
And so you say, "OK, how much pressure is generated?"
你会说：“好吧， 这里产生的压力有多大？”

171
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.119
And from studies where some incredible women
一些超赞的女性曾志愿

172
00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:43.296
have volunteered to have pressure catheters
在她们的子宫内植入压力导管，

173
00:07:42.927 --> 00:07:43.937
put in their uterus
让学者们进行研究，

174
00:07:43.937 --> 00:07:46.875
that they wear their whole menstrual cycle --
她们在整个月经周期 都带着那个导管——

175
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:50.088
God bless them, because we wouldn't have this knowledge without,
感谢她们，因为没有她们， 我们不会了解这个知识，

176
00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:51.994
and it's very important knowledge,
而这是一个很重要的知识。

177
00:07:51.994 --> 00:07:54.580
because the pressure that's generated in the uterus
因为在月经期间

178
00:07:54.903 --> 00:07:56.171
during menstruation
子宫内产生的压力

179
00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:58.296
is 120 millimeters of mercury.
为 120 毫米汞柱。

180
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.713
"Well what's that," you say.
你会问：“这代表什么？”

181
00:07:59.737 --> 00:08:02.546
Well, it's the amount of pressure that's generated
这相当于你分娩第二阶段用力时

182
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.088
during the second stage of labor when you're pushing.
所产生的压力。

183
00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:06.104
(Audience gasps)
（观众倒吸冷气）

184
00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:07.546
Right.
没错。

185
00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:10.383
Which, for those of you who haven't had an unmedicated delivery,
对于在座没有进行过 非药物分娩的人，

186
00:08:10.737 --> 00:08:13.129
that's what it's like when the blood pressure cuff
这就好比你戴着的血压袖套

187
00:08:12.716 --> 00:08:14.675
is not quite as tight as it was at the beginning,
不像一开始那样紧，

188
00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:15.913
but it's still pretty tight,
但依旧蛮紧，

189
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:18.120
and you wish it would stop.
而且你希望它会停止的 那种感觉。

190
00:08:18.237 --> 00:08:20.379
So that kind of makes it different, right?
这情况就变得很不一样了，对吧？

191
00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:24.296
If you start thinking about the pain of menstruation,
如果你开始回想经期疼痛，

192
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.921
we wouldn't say if someone needed to miss school
我们不会说—— 倘若一个人在学校旷课，

193
00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:29.754
because they were in the second stage of labor and pushing,
是因为她们处于分娩第二阶段， 并且用力在生孩子，

194
00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:31.129
we wouldn't call them weak.
我们不会说她们是弱者，

195
00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:33.730
We'd be like, "Oh my God, you made it that far," right?
而会说，“我的天 ， 你竟然做到了！”对吧？

196
00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:34.963
(Laughter)
（笑声）

197
00:08:34.987 --> 00:08:37.421
And we wouldn't deny pain control
我们不会否认

198
00:08:36.623 --> 00:08:40.758
to women who have typical pain of labor, right?
那些承受典型分娩阵痛女性的 忍痛能力，对吧？

199
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:44.379
So it's important for us to call this pain "typical" instead of "normal,"
用“典型”，而非“正常” 来形容这种疼痛很重要，

200
00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:47.338
because when we say it's normal, it's easier to dismiss.
因为当我们说这很正常， 这说明疼痛很容易消失。

201
00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:50.838
As opposed to saying it's typical, and we should address it.
然而说这很典型， 代表我们需要解决它。

202
00:08:50.862 --> 00:08:55.338
And we do have some ways to address menstrual pain.
我们确实有一些解决痛经的办法。

203
00:08:55.362 --> 00:08:57.463
One way is with something called a TENS unit,
一个方法就是使用 经皮神经电刺激（TENS）止痛仪，

204
00:08:57.487 --> 00:08:59.296
which you can wear under your clothes
你可以把它贴在衣服里，

205
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.421
and it sends an electrical impulse to the nerves and muscles
它能将电流送往神经和肌肉，

206
00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:04.254
and no one really knows how it works,
并且没人真正知道其中的原理，

207
00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.796
but we think it might be the gate theory of pain,
但我们认为这个技术可能是 基于闸门理论，

208
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.379
which is counterirritation.
即反刺激。

209
00:09:08.403 --> 00:09:12.171
It's the same reason why, if you hurt yourself, you rub it.
同样这也是为什么如果 你伤到了自己，你会搓揉疼痛处。

210
00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:16.004
Vibration travels faster to your brain than pain does.
振动，相比疼痛， 能够更快地被神经传导至大脑。

211
00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:17.573
We also have medications
我们也有药物方法，

212
00:09:17.403 --> 00:09:20.171
called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.
实用非甾体抗炎药物（NSAID）。

213
00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:23.963
And what they do is they block the release of prostaglandins.
它们的主要作用是 抑制前列腺素的合成。

214
00:09:23.987 --> 00:09:27.879
They can reduce menstrual pain for 80 percent of women.
该药物可为 80% 的女性 缓解痛经，

215
00:09:27.903 --> 00:09:31.671
They also reduce the volume of blood by 30 to 40 percent
也可以减少 30% - 40% 的出血量，

216
00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:34.088
and they can help with period diarrhea.
同时缓解经期腹泻情况。

217
00:09:34.112 --> 00:09:36.671
And we also have hormonal contraception,
我们也有荷尔蒙避孕药，

218
00:09:36.695 --> 00:09:38.963
which gives us a thinner lining of the uterus,
让我们的子宫内膜变薄，

219
00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:41.296
so there's less prostaglandins produced
从而减少前列腺素的生成，

220
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.671
and with less blood, there's less need for cramping.
并缓解出血情况， 同时对痉挛的需求也变小。

221
00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:47.463
Now, if those treatments fail you --
如果这些治疗方法 对你都没用——

222
00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.713
and it's important to use that word choice,
这里的措辞很重要，

223
00:09:49.737 --> 00:09:52.129
because we never fail the treatment,
因为我们从不会让治疗失败，

224
00:09:52.153 --> 00:09:54.754
the treatment fails us.
而是治疗对我们没用。

225
00:09:54.778 --> 00:09:56.921
If that treatment fails you,
如果那些治疗方法“辜负”了你，

226
00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:58.422
you could be amongst the people
你可能属于

227
00:09:58.446 --> 00:10:02.504
who have a resistance to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.
对 NSAID 具有抗药性的一批人。

228
00:10:02.528 --> 00:10:04.088
We don't quite understand,
我们尚未完全理解，

229
00:10:04.112 --> 00:10:06.213
but there are some complex mechanisms
为什么这些药物 就是对某些女性无效用，

230
00:10:06.237 --> 00:10:09.796
why those medications just don't work for some women.
这其中包含着一些很复杂的机制。

231
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.129
It's also possible that you could have
也可能是因为， 导致你经期疼痛的原因

232
00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:15.546
another reason for painful periods.
与上述情况都不同。

233
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.254
You could have a condition called endometriosis,
也可能是因为你 患有子宫内膜异位症，

234
00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:21.338
where the lining of the uterus is growing in the pelvic cavity,
即，子宫内膜生成于盆腔中

235
00:10:21.362 --> 00:10:24.921
causing inflammation and scar tissue and adhesions.
进而引起炎症， 疤痕组织以及黏附现象。

236
00:10:24.945 --> 00:10:28.338
And there may be other mechanisms we don't quite understand yet,
或许其中还有我们 尚未了解的机制存在，

237
00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:31.546
because it's a possibility that pain thresholds could be different
因为这会牵涉到 非常复杂的生物学机制，

238
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.254
due to very complex biological mechanisms.
疼痛阈值也可能会随之不同。

239
00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:37.463
But we're only going to find that out by talking about it.
但我们只有通过不断谈论它， 才能发现更多。

240
00:10:37.487 --> 00:10:40.588
It shouldn't be an act of feminism
了解你的身体如何运作

241
00:10:40.612 --> 00:10:42.754
to know how your body works.
不应该是一种女权主义的行为。

242
00:10:42.778 --> 00:10:44.046
It shouldn't --

243
00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:47.122
(Applause)

It shouldn't be an act of feminism
在你身受月经折磨时寻求帮助，

245
00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:55.710
to ask for help when you're suffering.

246
00:10:56.918 --> 00:11:01.687
The era of menstrual taboos is over.

(Cheers and applause)
（喝彩与掌声）

248
00:11:07.153 --> 00:11:09.296
The only curse here
这里唯一的魔咒

249
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.921
is the ability to convince half the population
就是说服一半的人口，

250
00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:17.338
that the very biological machinery that perpetuates the species,

251
00:11:17.362 --> 00:11:19.838
that gives everything that we have,

252
00:11:19.862 --> 00:11:22.421
is somehow dirty or toxic.

253
00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:25.004
And I'm not going to stand for it.

254
00:11:24.888 --> 00:11:28.116
