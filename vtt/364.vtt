So I started asking my friends and neighbors

That person is then responsible for arranging your funeral,

If you die leaving a spouse or a domestic partner,

123
00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:15.602
then chances are they will receive your estate,
那么他们可能会得到你的遗产

124
00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:18.546
but if you are single, it's far more complicated,

125
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.126
as parents, siblings, half-siblings and dependents all come into play.
因为父母、同胞、异父／异母同胞、和受抚养者都会有影响

126
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:28.275
And did you know that if you make a regular donation to charity,

127
00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:31.214
that charity may have grounds to make a claim on your estate?
那个慈善机构会有资格获得你的遗产？

128
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.604
The most important thing to know is the bigger your estate,

129
00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.518
the more complicated that will will be,

and the more expensive that bill.
而且账单就越昂贵

131
00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:43.887
So if you don't have a will, I ask you ...

00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:50.387
when else in your life have you willingly given money to the government

I lost my father in February to a progressive lung disease.
