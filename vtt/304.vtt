1
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.540
So infectious diseases, right?
说到传染病

2
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.017
Infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death  around the world.
传染病仍然是全球人类生病和死亡的主因。

3
00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:23.187
Every year, millions of people die of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,
每年，数以万计的人们死于

4
00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:25.533
around the world and even in the United States.
肺结核、疟疾、以及艾滋病

5
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.139
Every year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu.
甚至在美国，每年都有成千上万的人因流感致命。

6
00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:31.294
Now of course, humans, we are creative. Right?
人类不是很有创意吗？

7
00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:34.619
We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases.
我们想出不少办法保护自己，

8
00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:35.924
We have drugs and vaccines.
用药物和疫苗抵抗传染病。

9
00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:41.236
And we're conscious -- we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions.
我们十分谨慎地总结经验得出创新的解决办法。

10
00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:44.301
We used to think we're alone in this, but now we know we're not.
我们以为只有人类才懂医学

11
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:46.120
We're not the only medical doctors.
但是其实不然

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.526
Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too.
许多其他动物也有类似的机制

13
00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:51.150
Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.
最典型的是大猩猩

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.651
Not so much different from us,
和人类差不多

15
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.516
they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites.
它们会利用植物清理肠道寄生虫

16
00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:58.963
But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too:
几十年的研究发现很多动物都会保护自己

17
00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:02.342
elephants, porcupines, sheep, goats, you name it.
大象、豪猪、绵羊、山羊…数不胜数

18
00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:05.981
And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us
更有趣的是，最近的研究发现

19
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:11.423
that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too.
昆虫和其他小型生物也懂得医疗

20
00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:15.901
The problem with infectious diseases, as we all know, is that pathogens continue to evolve,
我们都知道传染病的病原体不断演化。

21
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.137
and a lot of the drugs that we have developed
我们过去开发的一些药物

22
00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:19.796
are losing their efficacy.
正在逐渐失效

23
00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:24.029
And therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs
因此我们更需要不断开发新药物

24
00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:25.933
that we can use against our diseases.
来应对不断变化的病原体。

25
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.487
Now, I think that we should look at these animals,
现在我们来研究一下这些动物

26
00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:31.621
and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases.
看看从它们身上哪些是值得借鉴的

27
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.451
As a biologist, I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.
作为生物学家，我研究了十年帝王斑蝶

28
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:39.819
Now, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations
帝王斑蝶以它们壮观的迁徙而闻名

29
00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.949
from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year, where millions of them come together,
每年不计其数的帝王斑蝶来到一起从美国和加拿大迁徙到墨西哥

30
00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:47.480
but it's not why I started studying them.
但这并非我研究它们的原因

31
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.871
I study monarchs because they get sick.
我研究它们是因为它们会生病

32
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.333
They get sick like you. They get sick like me.
就像在座的你我

33
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.020
And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs
我认为我们可以从它们身上得到启发

34
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.232
that we can develop for humans.
来开发适用于人类的药物

35
00:01:57.232 --> 00:01:59.667
Now, the parasites that monarchs get infected with
帝王斑蝶身上的寄生虫叫做

36
00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:03.546
are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha -- a mouthful.
ophryocystis elektroscirrha

37
00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:07.704
What they do is they produce spores, millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly
这些寄生虫在蝶身上引起大量的孢子

38
00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:11.081
that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly.
可以从鳞片夹缝中看见这些细小的斑点

39
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.439
And this is really detrimental to the monarch.
它们威胁着帝王斑蝶的健康

40
00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.087
It shortens their lifespan,
缩短了它们的寿命

41
00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:17.192
it reduces their ability to fly,
影响它们的飞行能力

42
00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:19.699
it can even kill them before they're even adults.
甚至导致它们还没成年就死亡。

43
00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.580
Very detrimental parasite.
这种寄生虫非常致命。

44
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.736
As part of my job, I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants,
我工作时经常需要在温室里种植植物

45
00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:29.289
and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters.
因为帝王斑蝶十分挑食

46
00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:31.284
They only eat milkweed as larvae.
它们只吃乳草的幼草

47
00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.369
Luckily, there are several species of milkweed that they can use,
幸好我找到了几种它们食用的乳草。

48
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.725
and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them.
这些乳草中含有卡烯內酯，

49
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.519
These are chemicals that are toxic.
是一种具有毒性的物质

50
00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.914
They're toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs.
奇怪的是它对帝王斑蝶无害

51
00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:43.136
In fact, monarchs can take up the chemicals,
帝王斑蝶吸收了这种毒素

52
00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:45.544
put it in their own bodies, and it makes them toxic
携带这种毒素在体内

53
00:02:45.544 --> 00:02:47.823
against their predators, such as birds.
用于对付诸如鸟类的天敌

54
00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:50.197
And what they do, then, is advertise this toxicity
它们用身上鲜豔的黄黑白斑纹

55
00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:52.218
through their beautiful warning colorations
来广告自己的毒性。

56
00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.296
with this orange, black and white.
一种自然警告标志。

57
00:02:54.296 --> 00:02:58.168
So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse,
当我在温室善尽己责，

58
00:02:58.168 --> 00:02:59.914
different ones, different milkweeds.
种植不同乳草时，

59
00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:02.668
Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed,
某些毒性很高，像是热带乳草，

60
00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:05.957
with very high concentrations of these cardenolides.
有大量的強心甾 (cardenolides)，

61
00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:07.135
And some were not toxic.
某些却没有毒素。

62
00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:09.455
And then I fed them to monarchs.
在我喂食帝王斑蝶时，

63
00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.078
Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease.
某些斑蝶没有染病，很健康。

64
00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:13.853
But some of the monarchs were sick,
某些斑蝶则生着病，

65
00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:16.876
and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal,
我发现某些乳草有药效，

66
00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:20.113
meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies,
有效减低帝王斑蝶的症状

67
00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:23.230
meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected
只要它们食用这些药草，

68
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.144
when feeding on these medicinal plants.
就可以延长自己的性命。

69
00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:27.855
And when I found this, I had this idea,
当我发现的时候，

70
00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.163
and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea,
我有了一很多人觉得很疯狂的想法

71
00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:32.637
but I thought,  what if monarchs can use this?
我想，如果帝王斑蝶可以应用呢？

72
00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:35.696
What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine?
如果它们可以把这些乳草当作药物呢？

73
00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:38.298
What if they can act as medical doctors?
如果它们可以为自己开药房呢？

74
00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:40.674
So my team and I started doing experiments.
我们的团队开始实验，

75
00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:42.475
In the first types of experiments,
在第一类实验里，

76
00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:44.645
we had caterpillars, and gave them a choice:
我们给幼虫两种选择：

77
00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:47.386
medicinal milkweed versus non-medicinal milkweed.
有药性的乳草和没有药性的乳草。

78
00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:51.006
And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime.
然后测量它们一生各自吃了多少。

79
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.020
And the result, as so often  in science, was boring:
就像大部分的科学研究结果一样，答案很无聊：

80
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.271
Fifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not.
有药性和没有药性的各半。

81
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.541
These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare.
这些幼虫没有为自己做出有利的选择。

82
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:04.506
So then we moved on to adult butterflies,
于是我们转为研究成蝶。

83
00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:09.555
and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring.
我们想母蝶会对自己的幼虫用药吗？

84
00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:12.329
Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
它们会把卵产在有药的乳草上，

85
00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.528
that will make their future offspring less sick?
减轻幼虫的症状？

86
00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:18.056
We have done these experiments now over several years,
我们复制这个实验多年，

87
00:04:18.056 --> 00:04:19.844
and always get the same results.
得到一样的结果。

88
00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:22.006
What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage,
我们把帝王斑蝶放进大笼子里，

89
00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:25.489
a medicinal plant on one side, a non-medicinal plant on the other side,
一边的乳草是有药性的，一边没有，

90
00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:30.065
and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant.
然后测量它们在两种乳草上的产卵数，

91
00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:33.174
And what we find when we do that is always the same.
获得的结果是一致的。

92
00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:36.767
What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.
我们发现帝王斑蝶偏好药性乳草。

93
00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:38.868
In other words, what these females are doing
换句话说

94
00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:42.212
is they're laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.
雌蝶把 68％ 的卵产在药性乳草上。

95
00:04:42.212 --> 00:04:46.432
Intriguingly, what they do is they actually transmit the parasites
事实上，在它们产卵的时候，

96
00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:47.897
when they're laying the eggs.
也不可避免的

97
00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:49.332
They cannot prevent this.
传播了寄生虫。

98
00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:51.263
They can also not medicate themselves.
它们不能治疗自己。

99
00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:53.500
But what these experiments tell us
但这个实验告诉我们

100
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.329
is that these monarchs, these mothers, can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
帝王斑蝶把卵产在有药性的乳草上，

101
00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:00.968
that will make their future offspring less sick.
减轻幼虫的病况。

102
00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:05.401
Now, this is a really important discovery, I think,
这个发现很重要。

103
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:08.235
not just because it tells us something cool about nature,
不只是因为它显示了大自然的奥妙，

104
00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:11.921
but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs.
更提醒我们应该如何开发药物。

105
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.921
Now, these are animals that are very small
这些动物都很小，

106
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:16.020
and we tend to think of them as very simple.
我们曾经觉得它们构造单纯，

107
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.577
They have tiny little brains,
它们的大脑很小，

108
00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:20.001
yet they can do this very sophisticated medication.
但它们却懂得利用自然药草。

109
00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:23.209
Now, we know that even today, most of our drugs
直至今日，

110
00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.968
derive from natural products, including plants,
我们从自然中提取药物，包括植物，

111
00:05:25.968 --> 00:05:27.580
and in indigenous cultures,
在一些原始文化中，

112
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.415
traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs.
传统疗法时常借镜动物来找新药方。

113
00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:33.822
In this way, elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset,
大象教我们如何治疗肠胃不适，

114
00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:37.111
and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea.
刺猬教我们如何处理腹泻。

115
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:39.766
What I think is important,  though, is to move beyond
我想，最重要的是，

116
00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:43.574
these large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit,
除了那些大脑发达的哺乳类动物外，

117
00:05:43.574 --> 00:05:46.476
these simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of
我们也应该更加注重

118
00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:49.725
as very, very simple with tiny little brains.
那些构造简单的动物、昆虫。

119
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:53.696
The discovery that these animals can also use medication
发现这些动物懂得用药，

120
00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:56.175
opens up completely new avenues,
让我们进入全新领域。

121
00:05:56.175 --> 00:06:00.889
and I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases
也许有一天，

122
00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.998
with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies,
我们会用蝴蝶找到的药物来治疗人类，

123
00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:07.973
and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing.
我想这个机会是值得把握的。

124
00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:10.136
Thank you so much.
谢谢各位。

125
00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:14.641
(Applause)
