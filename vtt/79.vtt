28
00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:33.920
but here's how it works.

32
00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:42.501
You heat up one side. the hot side.

33
00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:45.544
The ammonia evaporates and it recondenses in the other side.

34
00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:48.106
You let it cool to room temperature.

35
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.293
and then. as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water

36
00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:52.920
back on the erstwhile hot side.
[AI] 回到从前的热点。

37
00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:54.798
it creates a powerful cooling effect.

38
00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:57.654
So it was a great idea that didn't work at all.

39
00:01:57.678 --> 00:01:58.872
They blew up.

42
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.533
if you heated them wrong;

45
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.672
