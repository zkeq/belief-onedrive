马：是的。她在重症监护室一住就是好几周，

到医学院课本，到期刊文章 这样反复来读，

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:22.390
but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.

any medicines for rare and orphan diseases,

143
00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:36.051
to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension.

MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome
马：我去了葛兰素威康

146
00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:47.727
and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face
吃了三次闭门羹，

147
00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:51.235
because they weren't going to out-license the drug

to a satellite communications expert,

I wore down their resistance,

克：然后你非常聪明的把这个药推到了市场上，

161
00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:45.174
by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work.
而且只收成本价。

MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up --
马：是的，克里斯，但我 当时买下来的并不是个成品药－

163
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:52.000
after I wrote the check for 25,000,
我签了那两万五的支票后，

164
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.810

of a small amount of powder.

If it was turned into a medicine, it could never be delivered

CA: And yet, a year or two later, you were there with a medicine
