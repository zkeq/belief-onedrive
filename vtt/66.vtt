今天，我想和你们分享， 目前为止我从水之道中

62
00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:21.400
from this philosophy of water --
所学到的三个道理——

63
00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:25.782
three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment
是它们，让我在做 每一件事时都获得了

64

in almost everything that I do.
更大的满足感。

65
00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.360
The first lesson is about humility.
第一个道理，是要保持谦逊的态度。

66
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.605
If we think about water flowing in a river,
试想，河流中的水

67
00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.624
it is always staying low.
总是在低处汩汩流淌。

68
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.730
It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive.
有了水，植物才能生长， 动物才能存活。

69
00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:43.817
It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself,
可它却从不居功自傲，

70
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.176
nor does it need any reward or recognition.
也不需要尘世的褒奖和认可。

71
00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:48.530
It is humble.
它很谦逊。

72
00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:52.111
But without water's humble contribution,
如果没有水这样不求回报的贡献，

73
00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:54.668
life as we know it may not exist.
现今世界上的生命可能就不复存在了。

74
00:03:56.923 --> 00:03:59.512
Water's humility taught me a few important things.
水的谦逊让我明白了以下几点。

75
00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:03.820
It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing
其实我不必表现得像个万事通，

76
00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:05.540
or I have all the answers,
一副什么都知道的样子，

77
00:04:05.564 --> 00:04:07.619
it's perfectly OK to say,
说出“我不知道，

78
00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:09.008
"I don't know.
我想要学习更多，

79
00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:10.429
I want to learn more,
我需要你的帮助。”

80
00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:11.705
and I need your help."
没什么丢人的。

81
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.824
It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success,
水的谦逊还让我明白， 为自己寻求成功之道

82
00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:20.706
it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others.
远不如帮助他人成功 来得快乐和满足。

83
00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.603
It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead,
与个人的成功相比，

84
00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:27.699
it so much more fulfilling and meaningful
帮助他人克服困难，走向成功

85
00:04:27.723 --> 00:04:31.253
to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed.
才是更有满足感，更有意义的事。

86
00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:34.445
With a humble mindset,
怀着一颗谦逊的心，

87
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.304
I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me.

88
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.595
I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences

89
00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:44.571
that make them unique and magical.
让他们成为了现在独特的自己。

90
00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:46.350
Life became a lot more fun,
我发现生活变得更有趣了，

91
00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:49.421
because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas

92
00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:51.849
and new solutions to problems I didn't know before,
还有之前从来不知道的 解决问题的新方法，

93
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.280
all thanks to the ideas and help from others.
多亏了身边的人给我的建议和帮助。

94
00:04:56.913 --> 00:04:59.746
All streams eventually flow to the ocean
百川最终汇入广阔的大海，

95
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.478
because it is lower than them.
因为大海在低处。

96
00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.733
Humility gives water its power.
谦逊赋予了水以力量。

97
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.873
But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded,
不过我想到的是， 谦虚使我们能脚踏实地，

98
00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:12.255
to be present,
活在当下，

99
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.826
to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us.
取人之长，补己之短。

100
00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:21.177
The second lesson I learned is about harmony.
我所学到的第二个道理， 是保持平和的心态。

101
00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.111
If we think about water flowing towards a rock,
想想看，如果水为石头所阻，

102
00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:25.498
it will just flow around it.
它会绕过那块石头。

103
00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:28.524
It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry,

104
00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:30.072
it doesn't get agitated.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.977
In fact, it doesn't feel much at all.

106
00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:36.976
When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution,

107
00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:39.815
without force, without conflict.

108
00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.403
When I was thinking through this, I began to understand

109
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.902
why I was feeling stressed out in the first place.

110
00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:49.842
Instead of working in harmony with my environment,

111
00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:51.532
I was working against it.

112
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:53.687
I was forcing things to change
我强迫身边的事物改变，

113
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:57.735
because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself.

114
00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:00.071
In the end, nothing did.
到最后，事与愿违，

115
00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.142
And I got more frustrated.
于是我变得更加沮丧。

116
00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:06.476
By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success
从追求更多的成功

117
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.246
to trying to achieve more harmony,
到追求更多的和谐，

118
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.740
I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again.
我很快感到了内心的平静， 专注度也提高了。

119
00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:15.473
I started asking questions like:
我开始问自己：

120
00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:18.219
Will this action bring me greater harmony

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.081
I became more comfortable simply being who I am,

rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be.

00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:36.342
because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control

and only on the things that I can.

I stopped fighting with myself,

130

“道恒无为，

131
00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.557
Yet, everything is accomplished.

00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:55.072
That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony.
这是《道德经》对“和谐”的力量的描述。

133
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.166
Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict,
就像水解决问题从不 借助武力、引起冲突一样，
