and, to be honest, I was quite afraid to look into them.

5
00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.716
The first mystery was, I'm 40 years old,

And I wanted to understand this because of a more personal mystery.

15
00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:56.533
When I was a teenager,
当我还是10来岁时，

16
00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:57.978
I remember going to my doctor

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:10.461
And my doctor told me a story
医生告诉我了一个

22
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.498
that I now realize was well-intentioned,
现在我意识到是出于好意的故事，

23
00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.214
but quite oversimplified.

00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:15.406
Not totally wrong.

25
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.222
My doctor said, "We know why people get like this.
我医生说，“我们知道 人们为什么会这样。

26
00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:22.478
Some people just naturally get a chemical imbalance in their heads --

27
00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:23.923
you're clearly one of them.

28
00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:25.931
All we need to do is give you some drugs,

29
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:28.319
it will get your chemical balance back to normal."

30
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.517
So I started taking a drug called Paxil or Seroxat,

31
00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:33.803
it's the same thing with different names in different countries.

32
00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.310
And I felt much better, I got a real boost.

33
00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:37.745
But not very long afterwards,

So I was given higher and higher doses

36
00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:44.857
until, for 13 years, I was taking the maximum possible dose

38
00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:50.691

39
00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.215
I was still in a lot of pain.

40
00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.215
And I started asking myself, "What's going on here?

41
00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:56.781
Because you're doing everything

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:59.945
you're told to do by the story that's dominating the culture --

why do you still feel like this?"

So to get to the bottom of these two mysteries,

for a book that I've written

If I said to everyone here,
