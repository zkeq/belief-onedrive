1
00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.036
We have all probably wondered
我们可能都曾好奇过，

2
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.236
how great minds achieved what they achieved, right?
聪明人是怎样有所成就的，对吗？

3
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.916
And the more astonishing their achievements are,
并且他们的所作所为越令人惊叹，

4
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.476
the more we call them geniuses,
我们越习惯于叫他们天才，

5
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.036
perhaps aliens
或者是“外星人”，

6
00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.140
coming from a different planet,
来自另外的星球，

7
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.836
definitely not someone like us.
反正绝对不像我们这样普通。

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.636
But is that true?
但是，真的是这样吗？

9
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.460
So let me start with an example.
让我来举个例子说明。

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.076
You all know the story of Newton's apple, right? OK.
我们都知道牛顿的苹果。

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.036
Is that true? Probably not.
那个故事真的发生过吗? 可能没有。

12
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.276
Still, it's difficult to think that no apple at all was there.
当然，我们很难想象传说中的 苹果其实并不存在。

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.916
I mean some stepping stone, some specific conditions
我的意思是，宇宙万有引力定律的发现

14
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.956
that made universal gravitation not impossible to conceive.
是基于特定环境或媒介的铺垫。

15
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.356
And definitely this was not impossible,
这种说法有一定道理，

16
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.956
at least for Newton.
至少对于牛顿来说是这样。

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.236
It was possible,
这是可能的，

18
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.316
and for some reason, it was also there,
因为一些原因，它就在那里，

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.116
available at some point, easy to pick as an apple.
像够到那个苹果一样容易，

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.756
Here is the apple.
触手可及。

21
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.996
And what about Einstein?
那么对于爱因斯坦呢？

22
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.316
Was relativity theory another big leap in the history of ideas
相对论是历史上又一大 新思想的飞跃。

23
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.996
no one else could even conceive?
除了爱因斯坦， 就没人可以提出了吗？

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.476
Or rather, was it again something adjacent and possible,
或者说，相对论当时 就在我们身边，

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.596
to Einstein of course,
对于爱因斯坦也是一样，

26
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.836
and he got there by small steps and his very peculiar scientific path?
他一步步走在自己的科学发现之路上， 最终发现了相对论。

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.316
Of course we cannot conceive this path,
当然我们无从知道 这是一条怎样的路，

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.820
but this doesn't mean that the path was not there.
但这不能否认那条路的存在。

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.436
So all of this seems very evocative,
这两个例子好像暗示了

30
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.996
but I would say hardly concrete
一些什么，却又不具象，

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.596
if we really want to grasp the origin of great ideas
尤其当我们真的希望 找到变得更优秀的源头，

32
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.636
and more generally the way in which the new enters our lives.
或通俗一点说，我们怎样 在生活中发现新鲜事物的时候。

33
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.636
As a physicist, as a scientist,
作为一个物理学家，科学家，

34
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.836
I have learned that posing the right questions
我知道，提出正确的问题，

35
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.876
is half of the solution.
问题就解决了一半。

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.636
But I think now we start having a great conceptual framework
而我想，我们现在已经拥有了 很棒的概念性的框架

37
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.836
to conceive and address the right questions.
来发现和解决问题。

38
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.316
So let me drive you to the edge of what is known,
那么现在，让我带大家 进入身边所熟悉的领域，

39
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.436
or at least, what I know,
或至少，是我熟悉的。

40
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.516
and let me show you that what is known
让我来说明一下，从熟悉的领域开始

41
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.116
could be a powerful and fascinating starting point
去感知新奇，创新，或者创造

42
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.236
to grasp the deep meaning of words like novelty, innovation,
这类词语更深层的含义，

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.820
creativity perhaps.
是一个多么好的起点。

44
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.036
So we are discussing the "new,"
我们在讨论“新”，

45
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.716
and of course, the science behind it.
同时还有它背后的科学。

46
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.716
The new can enter our lives in many different ways,
“新”可以由不同的方式 进入我们的生活，

47
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.436
can be very personal,
可以是很私人的，

48
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.396
like I meet a new person,
比如，我认识了一个新朋友，

49
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.716
I read a new book, or I listen to a new song.
读了一本新书或者听了一首新歌；

50
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.996
Or it could be global,
也可以是普遍化的，

51
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.076
I mean, something we call innovation.
比如，我们所说的创新，

52
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.276
It could be a new theory, a new technology,
可以是新理论，新技术，

53
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.876
but it could also be a new book if you're the writer,
同样也可以是一本新书， 前提是你是个作家，

54
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.236
or it could be a new song if you're the composer.
也可以是一首新歌， 如果你是个作曲家。

55
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.556
In all of these global cases, the new is for everyone,
这所有的例子里的“新”， 是每个人都有机会接触发现的。

56
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.396
but experiencing the new can be also frightening,
但体验“新”却也常常令人担忧，

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.156
so the new can also frighten us.
因为我们面对“新”，会有畏惧感。

58
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.356
But still, experiencing the new means exploring a very peculiar space,
同时，体验“新”意味着 我们在探索一段奇特的领域，

59
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.476
the space of what could be,
它具有任意性，

60
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.676
the space of the possible, the space of possibilities.
还有可能性。

61
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.156
It's a very weird space, so I'll try to get you through this space.
这是个很神奇的领域， 不过我会尝试带大家领略一下。

62
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.196
So it could be a physical space.
它可以是某个物理空间。

63
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.836
So in this case, for instance,
比如，

64
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.916
novelty could be climbing Machu Picchu for the first time,
我在2016年第一次爬上

65
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.860
as I did in 2016.
马丘比丘（古代印加城遗址， 在今秘鲁中南部)。

66
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.596
It could be a conceptual space,
也可以是理论上的空间，

67
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.036
so acquiring new information, making sense of it, in a word, learning.
如获取新的信息， 简而言之，就是学习。

68
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.996
It could be a biological space.
它还可以是生物层次的。

69
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.116
I mean, think about the never-ending fight of viruses and bacteria
想想我们的免疫系统 与病毒及细菌之间

70
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:43.136
with our immune system.
永不停歇的对抗。

71
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.836
And now comes the bad news.
但是先别忙着乐观，

72
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.156
We are very, very bad at grasping this space.
我们非常不擅于察觉到“新”的存在。

73
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.196
Think of it. Let's make an experiment.
想一想是不是这样， 我们来做个实验。

74
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.100
Try to think about all the possible things you could do in the next, say, 24 hours.
尝试思考在未来的24小时内， 你可以做的所有可能的事情。

75
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.796
Here the key word is "all."
记住，关键词是“所有”。

76
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.620
Of course you can conceive a few options, like having a drink, writing a letter,
下意识地，你会有几个选择， 比如喝一杯饮料，写封信，

77
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.836
also sleeping during this boring talk,
或者在我无聊的陈述中打个小盹，

78
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.556
if you can.
如果你们想的话。

79
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.236
But not all of them.
但这不是所有我们要做的事情。

80
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.196
So think about an alien invasion, now, here, in Milan,
想一想外星人入侵， 对，就是现在，在米兰，

81
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.340
or me -- I stopped thinking for 15 minutes.
或者是我，在接下来的 15分钟内停下来不去思考。

82
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.396
So it's very difficult to conceive this space,
所以，要察觉到 所有可能发生的事情并不容易。

83
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.596
but actually we have an excuse.
但这可以理解。

84
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.116
So it's not so easy to conceive this space
不容易实现的原因是

85
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.635
because we are trying to conceive the occurrence of something brand new,
我们都尝试着 去发现一些绝对的“新”，

86
00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.636
so something that never occurred before,
一些以前从未发生的事情，

87
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.140
so we don't have clues.
所以我们找不到任何线索。

88
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.756
A typical solution could be
那么有什么解决办法吗？

89
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.996
looking at the future with the eyes of the past,
用目睹了过去的眼睛看未来，

90
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.316
so relying on all the time series of past events
就是凭借着在过去发生的事，

91
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.836
and hoping that this is enough to predict the future.
这些经历能支持我们预测未来。

92
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.036
But we know this is not working.
但实际上，这种方法的效果差强人意。

93
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.276
For instance, this was the first attempt for weather forecasts, and it failed.
就跟首次播报天气失败了一样。

94
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.716
And it failed because of the great complexity
因为事情多发生在表面，

95
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.676
of the underlying phenomenon.
而内部的复杂性却被忽略了。

96
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.316
So now we know that predictions had to be based on modeling,
所以，我们会通过建模来帮助预测，

97
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.836
which means creating a synthetic model of the system,
就是建立一个系统的综合模型，

98
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.996
simulating this model and then projecting the system
通过模型模拟，预测系统的

99
00:05:15.236 --> 00:05:18.586
into the future through this model.
未来发展。

100
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.516
And now we can do this in a lot of cases
在很多情况下，基于大量数据，

101
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.420
with the help of a lot of data.
我们都可以建模。

102
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.716
Looking at the future with the eye of the past
但用过去的眼睛（数据） 预测未来（系统），

103
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.476
could be misleading also for machines.
也可能会出错， 对计算机来说也是一样。

104
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.716
Think about it.
设想一个画面，

105
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.540
Now picture yourself for a second in the middle of the Australian Outback.
你在澳大利亚内陆地区，

106
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.980
You stand there under the sun.
站在太阳底下，

107
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.876
So you see something weird happening.
看到了一些奇怪的事情。

108
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.636
The car suddenly stops
远远地，一辆车突然停住了，

109
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.716
very, very far from a kangaroo crossing the street.
在它前面很远处 有一只袋鼠在过马路。

110
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.196
You look closer
你仔细一看，

111
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.636
and you realize that the car has no driver.
发现车里竟没有司机。

112
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.676
It is not restarting, even after the kangaroo is not there anymore.
袋鼠过完马路后， 汽车也没有重新启动。

113
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.596
So for some reasons,
因为一些原因，

114
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.156
the algorithms driving the car cannot make sense
这辆无人驾驶汽车内置的算法 并不能理解这种现象，

115
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.860
of this strange beast jumping here and there on the street.
一只奇怪的庞然大物 在街上蹦来蹦去。

116
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.660
So it just stops.
于是它就停下了。

117
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.676
Now, I should tell you, this is a true story.
这是个真实的故事。

118
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.396
It happened a few months ago to Volvo's self-driving cars
几个月前，沃尔沃的 无人驾驶汽车就这样

119
00:06:11.813 --> 00:06:14.116
in the middle of the Australian Outback.
停在了澳洲内陆中部地区。

120
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.076
(Laughter)
（笑声）

121
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.076
It is a general problem,
这个问题很普遍，

122
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.076
and I guess this will affect more and more in the near future
我想在不久的将来， 人工智能和机器学习

123
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.660
artificial intelligence and machine learning.
会在方方面面产生影响。

124
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.236
It's also a very old problem, I would say 17th century,
这个问题存在很久了， 17世纪就出现了。

125
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.396
but I guess now we have new tools and new clues to start solving it.
但我相信，现在的我们拥有 更多的新工具和方法去解决它。

126
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.596
So let me take a step back,
让我们暂时回到过去，

127
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.356
five years back.
五年前，

128
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.356
Italy. Rome. Winter.
意大利，罗马，冬天。

129
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.956
So the winter of 2012 was very special in Rome.
2012的冬天， 对罗马来说是很特别的，

130
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.540
Rome witnessed one of the greatest snowfalls of its history.
因为一场史无前例， 美不胜收的飘雪。

131
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.036
That winter was special also for me and my colleagues,
这个冬天对我和我的同事们 来说也有着特殊的意义，

132
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.556
because we had an insight about the possible mathematical scheme --
因为我们理解了一种 近乎合理的数学模型——

133
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.556
again, possible, possible mathematical scheme,
强调一下，只是可能，

134
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.420
to conceive the occurrence of the new.
用来帮助发现“新”。

135
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.756
I remember that day because it was snowing,
我记得那天在下雪，

136
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.556
so due to the snowfall, we were blocked, stuck in my department,
也正是因为这场雪， 我们被困在了办公室，

137
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.996
and we couldn't go home,
无法回家，

138
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.076
so we got another coffee, we relaxed
所以我们决定喝杯咖啡，放松一下，

139
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.876
and we kept discussing.
同时继续讨论我们的研究，

140
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.596
But at some point -- maybe not that date, precisely --
忽然之间——准确地说， 可能并不在那段小憩的时间——

141
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.516
at some point we made the connection
在某个时间点，我们在

142
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.516
between the problem of the new
发现“新”，与斯图亚特 · 考夫曼

143
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.956
and a beautiful concept proposed years before
曾经提出的一个美妙的

144
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.756
by Stuart Kauffman,
理论之间建立起了一种联系，

145
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.820
the adjacent possible.
即临界的可能性。

146
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.596
So the adjacent possible consists of all those things.
临界的可能性可以包含很多东西，

147
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.356
It could be ideas, it could be molecules, it could be technological products
比如新点子，新分子， 或者新科技产品。

148
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.316
that are one step away
我们距离这些实际存在的“新”，

149
00:07:40.848 --> 00:07:43.196
from what actually exists,
只有一步之遥。

150
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.636
and you can achieve them through incremental modifications
我们可以通过改变身边存在的事物，

151
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.220
and recombinations of the existing material.
或对其加以重组来发现“新”。

152
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.236
So for instance, if I speak about the space of my friends,
举个例子，比如我身边有一群朋友，

153
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.236
my adjacent possible would be the set of all friends of my friends
那么身边可能的“新”， 可以是一群我朋友的朋友，

154
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.660
not already my friends.
他们目前还不是我的朋友。

155
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.796
I hope that's clear.
希望我说的够清楚。

156
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.636
But now if I meet a new person,
如果我现在认识一个新朋友，

157
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.356
say Briar,
比如布莱尔，

158
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.436
all her friends would immediately enter my adjacent possible,
那么她的朋友们就会 立即成为我的“新”朋友的备选人，

159
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.980
pushing its boundaries further.
这样我的人脉就会越来越多。

160
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.196
So if you really want to look from the mathematical point of view --
如果你们想用数学角度 来看待这件事——

161
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.620
I'm sure you want --
我确信你们有这个想法——

162
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.996
you can actually look at this picture.
我们可以来看一眼这张图。

163
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.916
So suppose now this is your universe.
这就是你的世界。

164
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.196
I know I'm asking a lot.
我知道我要求有点多。

165
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.860
I mean, this is your universe. Now you are the red spot.
麻烦大家把自己置身于这张图，这个 红点，就是我们现在所处的位置。

166
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.756
And the green spot is the adjacent possible for you,
绿点便是我们身边可能的“新”，

167
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.876
so something you've never touched before.
即我们从未踏入的领域。

168
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.236
So you do your normal life.
我们过着正常的生活，

169
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.916
You move. You move in the space.
在自己的世界中一步一步走，

170
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.596
You have a drink. You meet friends. You read a book.
喝杯水，见个朋友，读本书，

171
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.516
At some point, you end up on the green spot,
在某个时间点， 我们就走到了这个绿点，

172
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.716
so you meet Briar for the first time.
比如，我们在这里 第一次见到了布莱尔，

173
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.076
And what happens?
然后呢？

174
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.396
So what happens is there is a new part,
在这个特殊时刻，

175
00:08:45.193 --> 00:08:48.981
a brand new part of the space,
我们会涉足一个崭新的领域，

176
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.156
becoming possible for you in this very moment,
我们从未投身的领域，

177
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.036
even without any possibility for you to foresee this
即使我们从未预想能走到

178
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.116
before touching that point.
这片未知的领域。

179
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.836
And behind this there will be a huge set of points
在踏入这片新区域后， 会有更多新领域，

180
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.556
that could become possible at some later stages.
在未来的某个时段可能被我们开启。

181
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.396
So you see the space of the possible is very peculiar,
所以我们看到了， 身边可能的未知领域是很神奇的，

182
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.636
because it's not predefined.
因为它的不可预知。

183
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.956
It's not something we can predefine.
我们没有办法提前得知，

184
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.356
It's something that gets continuously shaped and reshaped
这片区域是随着我们的行动和选择

185
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.980
by our actions and our choices.
被随时塑造的。

186
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.396
So we were so fascinated by these connections we made --
当时发现这一点联系时， 我们非常高兴——

187
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.316
scientists are like this.
科学家就是这样。

188
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.636
And based on this,
基于这一点，

189
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.876
we conceived our mathematical formulation for the adjacent possible,
我们发现了可以计算 临界可能性的数学公式，

190
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.356
20 years after the original Kauffman proposals.
在考夫曼理论提出的20年后。

191
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.516
In our theory -- this is a key point --
在我们的理论中，有一个关键点。

192
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.076
I mean, it's crucially based on a complex interplay
这个公式依赖于“新”区域的拓展

193
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.876
between the way in which this space of possibilities expands
及其重建之间复杂的相互影响，

194
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.436
and gets restructured,
以及我们自身探索

195
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.956
and the way in which we explore it.
“新”的方式。

196
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.836
After the epiphany of 2012,
在2012年的顿悟后，

197
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.516
we got back to work, real work,
我们回到工作中，进行实地考察，

198
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.436
because we had to work out this theory,
因为要将理论应用于实践。

199
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.876
and we came up with a certain number of predictions
我们提出了几个需要用实际生活

200
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.156
to be tested in real life.
来检验的预测。

201
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.076
Of course, we need a testable framework
当然，我们需要一个测试体系，

202
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.556
to study innovation.
来研究这个新方法。

203
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.636
So let me drive you across a few predictions we made.
让我简单介绍一下 我们所做的预测。

204
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.556
The first one concerns the pace of innovation,
第一个是创新的步调，

205
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.476
so the rate at which you observe novelties in very different systems.
即不同的体系中 发现“新”的速度。

206
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.996
So our theory predicts that the rate of innovation
我们的理论预测出这种速度

207
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.956
should follow a universal curve,
应该遵循通用曲线，

208
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.300
like this one.
比如这张图。

209
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.700
This is the rate of innovation versus time in very different conditions.
这是不同条件下新方法的 速率与时间的比值。

210
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.156
And somehow, we predict that the rate of innovation
通常，我们预测发现“新”的速率

211
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.876
should decrease steadily over time.
随着时间变长稳定降低，

212
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.996
So somehow, innovation is predicted to become more difficult
由于某些限制，随着我们行动的增加

213
00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.776
as your progress over time.
发现“新”会变得更加困难。

214
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.316
It's neat. It's interesting. It's beautiful. We were happy.
这个系统很巧妙， 有趣且迷人，我们都很高兴。

215
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.516
But the question is, is that true?
但问题是，这是真的吗？

216
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.420
Of course we should check with reality.
当然我们会根据现实情况校准。

217
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.796
So we went back to reality
所以我们回到现实中来，

218
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.956
and we collected a lot of data, terabytes of data,
收集了很多数据，多达万亿字节。

219
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.316
tracking innovation in Wikipedia, Twitter,
从维基百科，到推特记录，

220
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.556
the way in which we write free software,
记录我们写新程序的方式，

221
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.220
even the way we listen to music.
甚至听音乐的方式。

222
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.716
I cannot tell you, we were so amazed and pleased and thrilled
我绝对不会跟你们说， 我们是多么激动，雀跃地发现，

223
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.236
to discover that the same predictions we made in the theory
在许多不同实际的体系中，

224
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.836
were actually satisfied in real systems,
我们的预测与真实情况

225
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.396
many different real systems.
几乎没有差别。

226
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.916
We were so excited.
我们太激动了。

227
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.756
Of course, apparently, we were on the right track,
很明显，我们走在一条正确的路上，

228
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.276
but of course, we couldn't stop,
当然，我们不愿意就此停下，

229
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.796
so we didn't stop.
也没有停下。

230
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.916
So we kept going on,
我们一直努力着，

231
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.996
and at some point we made another discovery
直到某个时候， 我们发现了另外的新理论，

232
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.556
that we dubbed "correlated novelties."
我们把它叫做“关联性创新”。

233
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.836
It's very simple.
很简单，

234
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.756
So I guess we all experience this.
我想我们都经历过。

235
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.340
So you listen to "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen,
当我们听到莱昂纳德 · 科恩的 《苏珊》（歌曲）时，

236
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.916
and this experience triggers your passion for Cohen
这会激起你对科恩的热情，

237
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.756
so that you start frantically listening to his whole production.
然后你就会迫不及待地 去听他所有的作品，

238
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.076
And then you realize that Fabrizio De André here
然后你会看到一个名字， 法布里奇奥 · 德 · 安德雷，

239
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.076
recorded an Italian version of "Suzanne,"
翻唱了苏珊的意大利语版本，

240
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.116
and so on and so forth.
等等类似的例子。

241
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.116
So somehow for some reason,
不知怎么的，

242
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.036
the very notion of adjacent possible is already encoding the common belief
这个临界可能性的概念就会 根植于我们的信念中，

243
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.620
that one thing leads to another
即在很多不同的体系中，

244
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.276
in many different systems.
“新”的发现具有连续性。

245
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.596
But the reason why we were thrilled
那么我们为什么那么高兴呢，

246
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.144
is because actually we could give, for the first time,
因为第一次，我们可以把这种直觉

247
00:12:06.168 --> 00:12:08.236
a scientific substance to this intuition
科学地实体化，

248
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.916
and start making predictions
并且开始对

249
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.356
about the way in which we experience the new.
体验“新”的方式进行预测。

250
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.700
So novelties are correlated.
创新是互相联系的，

251
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.196
They are not occurring randomly.
并不会随意地发生。

252
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.676
And this is good news,
这是一个好消息，

253
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.436
because it implies that impossible missions
这意味着，有些看起来 不可能的任务

254
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.836
might not be so impossible after all,
其实是可行的，

255
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.956
if we are guided by our intuition,
只要我们跟着直觉走，

256
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.740
somehow leading us to trigger a positive chain reaction.
它会带领我们走上一条 积极正面的连锁反应链。

257
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.156
But there is a third consequence of the existence of the adjacent possible
但是，关于临界可能性， 还存在第三种结果，

258
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.716
that we named "waves of novelties."
我们叫它创新的浪潮。

259
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.436
So just to make this simple, so in music,
简单来说，在音乐中，

260
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.836
without waves of novelties,
如果没有创新的浪潮，

261
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.916
we would still be listening all the time to Mozart or Beethoven,
我们可能还在继续听着 莫扎特或贝多芬。

262
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.436
which is great,
好像听起来还行，

263
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.116
but we don't do this all the time.
但是我们不能一直这样下去。

264
00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.156
We also listen to the Pet Shop Boys or Justin Bieber -- well, some of us do.
我们同样会听宠物店男孩（乐队） 或贾斯汀 · 比伯——起码部分人会听。

265
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.356
(Laughter)
（笑声）

266
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.276
So we could see very clearly all of these patterns
所以我们可以从收集和 分析的庞大的数据中

267
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.036
in the huge amounts of data we collected and analyzed.
很清楚地看到这些例子。

268
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.716
For instance, we discovered that popular hits in music
比如，我们发现流行撞上音乐，

269
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.636
are continuously born, you know that,
产生的是什么，你们知道的。

270
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.100
and then they disappear, still leaving room for evergreens.
然后这些会消失，依然留有空间 给“常青树”（指经典音乐）。

271
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.036
So somehow waves of novelties ebb and flow
创新经历着潮起潮落，

272
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.636
while the tides always hold the classics.
而经典却永不消逝。

273
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.620
There is this coexistence between evergreens and new hits.
经典音乐和新流行可以共存。

274
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.436
Not only our theory predicts these waves of novelties.
不仅仅是我们的理论预测到了 创新浪潮的存在，

275
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.916
This would be trivial.
这不重要。

276
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.836
But it also explains why they are there,
重要的是，为什它们在那里，

277
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.836
and they are there for a specific reason,
基于某种特殊的原因，

278
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.076
because we as humans display different strategies
因为我们是人类， 会在充满可能性空间中

279
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.956
in the space of the possible.
展现不同的策略。

280
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.116
So some of us tend to retrace already known paths.
我们中的有些人倾向 去走已经走过的路，

281
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.460
So we say they exploit.
我们称之为开拓。

282
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.036
Some of us always launch into new adventures.
有的人愿意去做新的探险，

283
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.756
We say they explore.
这是探索。

284
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.076
And what we discovered is all the systems we investigated
我们发现的自己探究的东西，

285
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.276
are right at the edge between these two strategies,
就在开拓和探索的边缘，

286
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.836
something like 80 percent exploiting, 20 percent exploring,
就像80%是开发，20%是探索。

287
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.540
something like blade runners of innovation.
像是叶片式螺旋的创新。

288
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.756
So it seems that the wise balance, you could also say a conservative balance,
