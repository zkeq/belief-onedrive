1
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.196
Strap yourselves in,
大家做好准备

2
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.196
we're going to Mars.
我们要去火星。

3
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.316
Not just a few astronauts --
不仅仅是一些宇航员

4
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.476
thousands of people are going to colonize Mars.
成千上万的人 准备殖民火星。

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.620
And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon.
相信我，这将发生在不久的将来。

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.356
Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars,
你们当中的一些人将留在火星工作，

7
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.740
and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.
我保证 你们的孩子也将一直留在那里。

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.956
That probably sounds preposterous,
这可能听起来很荒谬

9
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.860
so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen.
所以我将和各位分享 这如何发生，何时发生。

10
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.796
But first I want to discuss the obvious question:
首先我想讨论一个 显而易见的问题：

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.299
Why the heck should we do this?
我们为什么要这么做？

12
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.676
12 years ago,
12年前，

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.516
I gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly.
我在TED进行了一场关于 十种世界突然毁灭的方式的演讲。

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.316
We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy.
我们在宇宙的奇思妙想面前 真的难以置信的脆弱。

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.916
A single, large asteroid could take us out forever.
单单一颗略大的小行星 就可以让我们永远消失。

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.396
To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet.
为了生存， 我们必须有后备的星球。

17
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.636
Think what a tragedy it would be
试想如果

18
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.260
if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.
人类所创造的所有成就瞬间消失 那将是多大的悲剧啊。

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.556
And there's another reason we should go:
还有一个原因：

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.516
exploration is in our DNA.
我们生而勇于探索。

21
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.996
Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa
两百万年前起源于非洲的人类

22
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.836
and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet
缓慢却坚定地 探索着望不到尽头的荒野

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.356
by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons.
最终足迹遍布了整个星球。

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.980
This stuff is inside us.
这是我们的灵魂。

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.340
And they prospered doing that.
而且他们成功了。

26
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.956
Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology
因为我们不停的探索， 文明和科技都取得了

27
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.900
came because we explored.
长足的进步。

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.356
Yes, we could do a lot of good
当然我们可以用钱

29
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.100
with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
搞定很多事情 去建立一个蒸蒸日上的火星殖民地。

30
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.260
And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet.
当然，我们也应该 更好地管理和爱护我们自己的星球。

31
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.900
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.
当然，我担心就像我们搞砸了地球一样， 我们可能也会搞砸火星。

32
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.756
But think for a moment,
不过先想一想，

33
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.716
what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon.
当肯尼迪总统向所有人宣布我们可以 把一个人类送到月球上时，

34
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.140
He excited an entire generation to dream.
他点燃了整代人的梦想。

35
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.156
Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars.
试想为了登陆火星 我们将受到多么大的鼓舞。

36
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.916
Perhaps then we will look back at Earth
也许孤身一人时，

37
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.316
and see that that is one people instead of many
会回想地球的时光。

38
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.876
and perhaps then we will look back at Earth,
也许我们在火星顽强生存时，

39
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.316
as we struggle to survive on Mars,
会回想地球的美好，

40
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.060
and realize how precious the home planet is.
会意识到家的宝贵。

41
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.260
So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake.
下面我来介绍 我们将进行的神奇旅程。

42
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.116
But first,
首先，

43
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.740
a few fascinating facts about where we're going.
介绍一下 我们将要去的地方的奇妙之处。

44
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.236
This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth.
这张照片真实的反应了 地球和火星的大小对比。

45
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.156
Mars is not our sister planet.
火星不是我们的姊妹星球，

46
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.956
It's far less than half the size of the Earth,
它比地球尺寸的一半还要小得多，

47
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.996
and yet despite the fact that it's smaller,
不过虽然火星小一些，

48
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.716
the surface area of Mars that you can stand on
在火星上表面 人类可以活动的面积

49
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.676
is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on,
和在地球上差不多大，

50
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.020
because the Earth is mostly covered by water.
因为地球主要被水覆盖。

51
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.116
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --
火星的大气层非常稀薄，

52
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.716
100 times thinner than on Earth --
只有地球的厚度的百分之一，

53
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.740
and it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.
而且火星上不能呼吸， 96%的空气是二氧化碳。

54
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.196
It's really cold there.
火星非常冷。

55
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.196
The average temperature is minus 81 degrees,
平均气温零下63摄氏度，

56
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.380
although there is quite a range of temperature.
昼夜温差也非常大。

57
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.716
A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth,
火星上的一昼夜的长短 和地球上差不多，

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.660
plus about 39 minutes.
比地球长大约39分钟。

59
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.300
Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.
火星上的每个季节和每年的时间 都是地球上的两倍长。

60
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.476
And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day,
对那些想插上翅膀 在火星上飞的人来说，

61
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.316
Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,
火星的重力比地球小很多，

62
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.596
and it's the kind of place
所以是个好选择。

63
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.420
where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.
不用绕过你的车 你可以直接跳过去。

64
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.596
Now, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,
如你所见， 火星并不是像地球，

65
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.380
but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.
但是这是整个太阳系里 除地球外最适合居住的地方了。

66
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.676
Here's the problem.
不过有个问题。

67
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.876
Mars is a long way away,
去火星路途遥远

68
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.740
a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon.
是地月距离的一千倍。

69
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.156
The Moon is 250,000 miles away
月亮在四十万公里外

70
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.820
and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there.
阿波罗号载着宇航员去那里要三天的时间。

71
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.676
Mars is 250 million miles away
火星在四亿公里以外

72
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.956
and it will take us eight months to get there --
要八个月我们才能到达，

73
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.260
240 days.
也就是240天。

74
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.476
And that's only if we launch on a very specific day,
而且我们每年只有两次机会，

75
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.236
at a very specific time,
趁地球和火星

76
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.236
once every two years,
成一条线的的时候

77
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.436
when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so,
在这个特殊的日子 特殊的时间降落，

78
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.380
so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.
因为这时候火箭运行 的距离才是最短的。

79
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.540
240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.
所有人在火箭里 待240天简直就是度日如年。

80
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.676
And meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy.
而且翻看过去我们去火星 的记录也不是很理想。

81
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.516
We and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese,
我们、俄罗斯人、欧洲人、日本人

82
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.876
the Chinese and the Indians,
中国人和印度人

83
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.476
have actually sent 44 rockets there,
一共发射了44只火箭，

84
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.036
and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed.
大部分都消失或者坠毁了。

85
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.660
Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.
只有三分之一 的火箭成功到达了火星。

86
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.940
And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway.
而且我们现在也没有 可以到达火星的足够大的火箭。

87
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.996
We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.
我们曾经有一只 叫做土星五号的大火箭。

88
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.636
A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there.
几只土星五号就可以把我们送过去。

89
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.116
It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans,
那是人类迄今为止制造的 最大的机器，

90
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.340
and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon.
它也正是带我们去月球的那只火箭。

91
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.956
But the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station,
但是在最后一只土星五号火箭 1973年把宇宙空间站送上太空后

92
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.076
and we decided to do something called the shuttle
继续登陆火星，

93
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.740
instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon.
转而开始研发航天飞机。

94
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.956
The biggest rocket we have now
目前我们所拥有的最大火箭

95
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.980
is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.
只有当时的一半大。

96
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.036
So getting to Mars is not going to be easy
所以去火星并不容易。

97
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.220
and that brings up a really interesting question ...
那么问题来了

98
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.580
how soon will the first humans actually land here?
第一批人类登陆火星还要多久？

99
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.316
Now, some pundits think if we got there by 2050,
一些专家认为进展顺利的话，

100
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.060
that'd be a pretty good achievement.
2025年我们可以成功登陆火星。

101
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.540
These days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.
最近NASA似乎认为 2040年前就可以送人类登陆火星。

102
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.300
Maybe they can.
也许他们可以做到。

103
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.516
I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.
我认为他们可以在2035年之前 就把人送入火星轨道。

104
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.796
But frankly,
但是坦白说，

105
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.556
I don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,
我不认为他们在2035年 还会操心发射火箭到火星的事情，

106
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.556
because we will already be there.
因为我们已经在那里了。

107
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.540
We're going to land on Mars in 2027.
我们将要在2027年登陆火星。

108
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.316
And the reason is
因为

109
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.396
this man is determined to make that happen.
有人下决心做到这件事。

110
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.900
His name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
他叫埃隆·马斯克 特斯拉和SpaceX公司的CEO。

111
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.796
Now, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025,
实际上他跟我说 2025年前我们就可以登陆火星，

112
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.716
but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am --
但是埃隆·马斯克 比我要乐观，

113
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.236
and that's going a ways --
这是他的行事方式，

114
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.900
so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack.
所以我多给他两年作为缓冲。

115
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.196
Still ...
不过，

116
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.556
you've got to ask yourself,
大家可能会怀疑，

117
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.460
can this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?
这个人真的可以在 2025年到2027年间做到么？

118
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.260
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective.
我们先看一下有埃隆·马斯克 的十年是如何发展的。

119
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.500
Where was this 10 years ago?
十年前是怎样的？

120
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.436
That's the Tesla electric automobile.
这是特斯拉电动汽车。

121
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.116
In 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying,
2005年很多汽车产业的人表示

122
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.580
we would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.
50年后我们才会有一辆 高级的电动汽车。

123
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.380
And where was that?
十年前的火箭产业呢？

124
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.116
That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,
这是SpaceX的 猎鹰9号运载火箭

125
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.516
lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.
满载六吨物资去往国际空间站。

126
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.756
10 years ago,
十年前，

127
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.340
SpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere.
SpaceX还没有发射过任何火箭。

128
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.956
So I think it's a pretty good bet
所以我认为

129
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.036
that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry
一个用不到十年时间

130
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.936
in less than 10 years
颠覆整个汽车产业

131
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.116
and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years
并且白手起家 创造整个火箭产业的人

132
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.380
will get us to Mars by 2027.
是可以在2027年前 带我们上火星的。

133
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.556
Now, you need to know this:
你要知道：

134
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.220
governments and robots no longer control this game.
政府和机器人不再是 太空飞行的掌控者，

135
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.236
Private companies are leaping into space
私人公司跳跃式的发展进入太空，

136
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.700
and they will be happy to take you to Mars.
他们很乐意带我们去火星。

137
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.580
And that raises a really big question.
不过随之而来的问题是

138
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.220
Can we actually live there?
我们真的可以在火星生存么？

139
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.676
Now, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040,
NASA也许直到2040年 才可以把我们送到火星，

140
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.796
or we may get there a long time before NASA,
也许我们在NASA之前 就已经到达火星了，

141
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.780
but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.
但是NASA需要解决 我们在火星如何生存的问题。

142
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.716
Let's look at the problem this way.
我们换个方式看这个问题。

143
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.596
Here's what you need to live on Earth:
这是在地球上生存的必需品：

144
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.036
food, water, shelter and clothing.
食物、水、住所和衣物。

145
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.556
And here's what you need to live on Mars:
这是在火星上生存的必需品：

146
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.780
all of the above, plus oxygen.
上面的所有加上氧气。

147
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.076
So let's look at the most important thing on this list first.
我们先说单子上最重要的东西。

148
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.116
Water is the basis of all life as we know it,
我们都知道水是生命之源，

149
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.716
and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live,
从地球带水去火星是不可能的，

150
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.380
so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars.
所以想要成功殖民火星 我们必须找到水源。

151
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.156
And if you look at Mars, it looks really dry,
乍一看火星是很干燥的，

152
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.996
it looks like the entire planet is a desert.
整个行星就像一个大沙漠，

153
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.036
But it turns out that it's not.
但实际上并非如此。

154
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.276
The soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water.
仅仅火星上的泥土就包含60%的水。

155
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.236
And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us --
仍然盘旋在火星上空的 人造卫星的照片告诉我们，

156
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.796
and by the way, that's a real photograph --
顺便说一句 这是一张真实照片，

157
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.956
that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them.
很多火星环形山中间都 被冰所覆盖。

158
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.180
It's not a bad place to start a colony.
在这里殖民就不错。

159
00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:07.836
Now, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,
这是2008年凤凰号火星登录器 进行的小小的挖掘的照片，

160
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.396
showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice --
可以看到地表下就是冰，

161
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.676
that white stuff is ice.
白色的就是冰，

162
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.956
In the second picture,
第二张图

163
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.236
which is four days later than the first picture,
拍摄于第一张图之后四天，

164
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.300
you can see that some of it is evaporating.
你可以看到部分冰升华了。

165
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.236
Orbiters also tell us
卫星也告诉我们

166
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.676
that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars
火星地下水和冰山资源

167
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.756
as well as glaciers.
都非常丰富。

168
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.036
In fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted,
实际上如果所有火星两级的冰融化了，

169
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.820
most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water.
火星上绝大部分地方 都会被9米深的水所覆盖。

170
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.876
So there's plenty of water there,
所以水资源很丰富。

171
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.436
but most of it's ice, most of it's underground,
不过大多数是冰  大多数在地下，

172
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.820
it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.
需要大量人力和能源去开采和挖掘。

173
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.596
This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington
这个仪器是1998年由华盛顿大学

174
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.100
back in 1998.
提出的设想。

175
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.716
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.
基本上这是一个低科技除湿器。

176
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.796
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid.
事实上火星大气 100%是非常潮湿的，

177
00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.196
So this device can extract all the water that humans will need
这个装置可以仅仅 从大气中吸取水分

178
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.620
simply from the atmosphere on Mars.
来满足人类需求。

179
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.956
Next we have to worry about what we will breathe.
接下来我们要考虑如何呼吸。

180
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.876
Frankly, I was really shocked
坦白地说我发现

181
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.460
to find out that NASA has this problem worked out.
NASA已经找到了 解决方案时我惊呆了。

182
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.060
This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht.
这位在MIT的科学家 叫做迈克尔·赫克特。

183
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.436
And he's developed this machine, Moxie.
他制造了这个机器，莫克西。

184
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.676
I love this thing.
我爱这个机器

185
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.276
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,
它本质上是一个反向燃料电池，

186
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.460
that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen.
吸收火星的大气释放氧气。

187
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.076
And you have to remember that CO2 --
96%的火星大气成分二氧化碳

188
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.956
carbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --
基本上可以转化成为

189
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.780
CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.
78%的氧气。

190
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.076
Now, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020
2020年下一个NASA 发射的巨型探测器

191
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.316
is going to have one of these devices aboard,
将会携带这些装置去火星，

192
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.036
and it will be able to produce enough oxygen
它可以制造足够一个人

193
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.756
to keep one person alive indefinitely.
一生取之不尽的氧气。

194
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.916
But the secret to this --
神奇的是，

195
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.636
and that's just for testing --
这只是在试验阶段，

196
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.956
the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go
神奇的是这个装置 从一开始被设计成

197
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.620
to be scalable by a factor of 100.
可以扩展到100倍大小的规模。

198
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.876
Next, what will we eat?
接下来我们吃什么？

199
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.836
Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,
我们用水培法种植作物，

200
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.716
but we're not going to be able to grow
不过我们的种植规模不能

201
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.876
more than 15 to 20 percent of our food there,
超过我们粮食需求的15-20%。

202
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.396
at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars
除非火星表面已经被水覆盖

203
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.740
and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops.
并且我们有可能也有能力种植作物。

204
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.756
In the meantime,
否则在此期间，

205
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.876
most of our food will arrive from Earth,
食物大多是干燥后

206
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.100
and it will be dried.
从地球运输过来。

207
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.380
And then we need some shelter.
接下来，我们需要住处

208
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.556
At first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings
一开始我们可以 住在充气密封建筑里

209
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.836
as well as the landers themselves.
和着陆器本身之中。

210
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.836
But this really only works during the daytime.
但是这只在白天才能实现。

211
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.956
There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays.
太阳辐射和宇宙射线太多了，

212
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.156
So we really have to go underground.
所以我们必须躲进地下。

213
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.876
Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,
已经证实火星上的土壤

214
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.876
by and large, is perfect for making bricks.
基本上很适合制造砖块。

215
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.116
And NASA has figured this one out, too.
NASA也发现了这个特点，

216
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.996
They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks,
他们在砖块里掺入一些聚合塑料，

217
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.796
shove them in a microwave oven,
然后在微波炉里挤压，

218
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.076
and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls.
这样你就可以用这些 非常厚实的砖块建造房屋了。

219
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.076
Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes,
或者我们可以选择 在火星上大量的洞穴和熔岩洞

220
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.380
of which there are plenty.
里面居住。

221
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.380
And finally there's clothing.
最后是衣物。

222
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.156
On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us,
在地球我们有 厚厚的大气堆在我们身上，

223
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.476
which creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times,
一直给予我们身体15磅的压力。

224
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.643
and we're constantly pushing out against that.
我们已经习惯抵抗这部分压力了。

225
00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.587
On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure.
火星上几乎没有大气压力，

226
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.436
So Dava Newman,
所以达瓦·纽曼，

227
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.916
a scientist at MIT,
这个MIT的科学家，

228
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.996
has created this sleek space suit.
制造了这个光滑的宇航服。

229
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.516
It will keep us together,
它可以让我们连在一起，

230
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.780
block radiation and keep us warm.
抵抗射线，并且保持体温。

231
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.876
So let's think about this for a minute.
所以仔细想一下，

232
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.900
Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...
有了食物、住所、衣物、水源和氧气，

233
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.980
we can do this.
万事俱备。

234
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.620
We really can.
前途是光明的，

235
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.660
But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.
但是道路是曲折的。

236
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.436
So that leads to the next big --
接下来要解决的问题是

237
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.036
really big step --
一个重要的问题：

238
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.876
in living the good life on Mars.
如何在火星很好的生活。

239
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.700
And that's terraforming the planet:
答案是地球化这个星球：

240
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.276
making it more like Earth,
让它更像地球一些，

241
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.140
reengineering an entire planet.
重新改造整个星球。

242
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.836
That sounds like a lot of hubris,
听起来好像过于狂妄了，

243
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.076
but the truth is
可是实际上

244
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.980
that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.
所有所需要的科技 我们已经有了。

245
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.740
First we've got to warm it up.
首先我们先把气候变暖，

246
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.916
Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere.
因为大气层稀薄火星非常的冷。

247
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.276
The answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars,
解决方案是， 火星的南极北极

248
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.556
both of which are covered
都覆盖着

249
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.756
with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide --
大量的固态二氧化碳

250
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.236
dry ice.
也就是干冰。

251
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.596
If we heat it up,
如果我们加热它们，

252
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.196
it sublimes directly into the atmosphere
它们会直接升华

253
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.036
and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.
并增加大气层的厚度， 和地球的情况一样。

254
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.276
And as we know,
我们都知道，

255
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.940
CO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas.
二氧化碳是非常强大的温室气体。

256
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:43.596
Now, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail
这是我非常喜欢的一个办法， 建造一块非常非常大的太阳光反射器

257
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.836
and focus it --
使它聚焦

258
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.596
it essentially serves as a mirror --
太阳光反射器本质上就是一面镜子

259
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.996
and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first.
把焦点一开始对在火星的南极

260
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.036
As the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it,
随着星球自转 镜子会加热并升华所有的干冰

261
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.316
and it will go into the atmosphere.
二氧化碳会进入到大气之中。

262
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.836
It actually won't take long
实际上火星的气温

263
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.116
for the temperature on Mars to start rising,
很快就会开始升高，

264
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.700
probably less than 20 years.
大概不到20年就可以。

265
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.596
Right now,
现在，

266
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.596
on a perfect day at the equator,
如果是夏天中的大晴天

267
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.716
in the middle of summer on Mars,
在火星的赤道上

268
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.196
temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees,
气温可以达到将近21摄氏度。

269
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.636
but then they go down to minus 100 at night.
但是在晚上 马上下降到零下73摄氏度。

270
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.236
(Laughter)
（笑声）

271
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.900
What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect:
我们为增强火星的温室效应而努力：

272
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.436
enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars --
让火星升温 这样很多火星上的冰，

273
00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.900
especially the ice in the ground -- melt.
尤其是地下的冰融化 。

274
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.220
Then we get some real magic.
接下来就是见证奇迹的时刻。

275
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.996
As the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better.
大气层变厚之后 一切都会好起来。

276
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.636
We get more protection from radiation,
我们受到更少的辐射，

277
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.756
more atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer,
大气更厚，温度升得更高，

278
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.476
so we get running water
我们还获得了流动的水资源，

279
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.100
and that makes crops possible.
人类才有可能耕种。

280
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.716
Then more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
然后越来越多的水蒸气进入空气中 这是另一种强大的温室气体。

281
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.180
It will rain and it will snow on Mars.
