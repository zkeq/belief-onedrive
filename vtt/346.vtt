00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:18.918
In the space that used to house one transistor, we can now fit one billion.
在以前，可以放置一个晶体管的空间现在可以放10亿个。

2
00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:23.353
That made it so that a computer the size of an entire room

3
00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.966
now fits in your pocket.
现在可以放在你的口袋里。

4
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.009
You might say the future is small.

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.638
As an engineer,
作为一个工程师，

6
00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:34.647
I'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers.

8
00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:41.766
I wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost
我想知道我们可否用这个技术挽救更多的生命，

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.897
due to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth:

10
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.339
cancer.
癌症。

11
00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:48.618
Now when I say that,
如今当我这样说的时候，

12
00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:52.420
what most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer.
许多人认为我说的是我们在研究治愈癌症。

13
00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:53.707
And we are.

15
00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:57.707
that there's an incredible opportunity to save lives

Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today.
在全球，用我们今天已有的技术，超过三分之二因癌症导致的死亡都是完全可以避免的。

18
00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:13.125
Things like vaccination, timely screening

19
00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.382
and of course, stopping smoking.

20
00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:19.729
But even with the best tools and technologies that we have today,

21
00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:21.816
some tumors can't be detected
一些肿瘤仍然无法被探测到，

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.510
until 10 years after they've started growing,
直到它们已经生长了十年才被发现，

23
00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:29.297
when they are 50 million cancer cells strong.
这时已经积累了5000万的癌细胞了。

24
00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:31.677
What if we had better technologies
要是我们有更好的技术

25
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.807
to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner,
在癌细胞刚刚产生时，在还可以被铲除时就能更快

26
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:38.358
when they could be removed, when they were just getting started?
监测到一些更为致命的癌症，会怎么样呢？

27
00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:41.657
Let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there.
让我来告诉你们微型技术如何可能让我们如愿。

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.248
This is a microscope in a typical lab
这是一个普通实验室中的显微镜，

29
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:48.828
that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen,
病理学家用它观察组织标本，

30
00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:51.290
like a biopsy or a pap smear.
就像活体切片或巴氏涂片。

31
00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:53.815
This $7,000 microscope
这个7000美元的显微镜

32
00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:58.908
would be used by somebody with years of specialized training to spot cancer cells.
可以被受过几年专业训练的人用来检测癌细胞。

33
00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.992
This is an image from a colleague of mine at Rice University,
这张图片来自于我莱斯大学的同事，

34
00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.568
Rebecca Richards-Kortum.
丽贝卡·理查兹科图姆。

35
00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:10.444
What she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope into this $10 part,
她和她的团队实现了微缩这整个显微镜到这个价值10美金的部件中，

36
00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:13.284
and it fits on the end of an optical fiber.
可以把它安装在光纤的一端。

37
00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:17.377
Now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient
这意味着无需在患者身上取得一个样本，

38
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.050
and sending it to the microscope,
并送到显微镜下检查，

39
00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:21.630
you can bring the microscope to the patient.
你可以直接就把显微镜带入病人体内。

40
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.439
And then, instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images,
并且，不用要求一个专业领域的人来观察这个图像，

41
00:02:26.463 --> 00:02:31.525
you can train the computer to score normal versus cancerous cells.
你直接可以训练电脑去比对正常和癌变的细胞。

42
00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:33.074
Now this is important,
这一点很重要，

43
00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:36.135
because what they found working in rural communities,
因为他们发现在农村地区工作，

44
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.398
is that even when they have a mobile screening van
就算他们有移动的检查车，

45
00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:43.684
that can go out into the community and perform exams and collect samples
可以走进农村进行检查并且收集样本，

46
00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:46.924
and send them to the central hospital for analysis,
传输样本到中心医院进行分析，

47
00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:48.292
that days later,
几天之后，

48
00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:50.983
women get a call with an abnormal test result
女性们接到一个异常测试结果的电话，

49
00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:52.608
and they're asked to come in.
并被要求来医院。

50
00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:56.991
Fully half of them don't turn up because they can't afford the trip.
有一半的人不会出现，因为她们无法支付路费。

51
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.965
With the integrated microscope and computer analysis,
有了集成显微镜和计算机分析技术，

52
00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.817
Rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van
丽贝卡和她的同事研发了同时具有

53
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:07.627
that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup.
诊断装置和治疗装置的医疗车。

54
00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:13.076
And what that means is that they can do a diagnosis and perform therapy on the spot,
这意味着他们可以集诊断和实施治疗于一车，

55
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.238
so no one is lost to follow up.
每个病人都不会错过跟踪治疗。

56
00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:19.599
That's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives.
这只是一个关于微型化如何拯救生命的例子。

57
00:03:19.968 --> 00:03:21.121
Now as engineers,
作为工程师，

58
00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:23.890
we think of this as straight-up miniaturization.
我们认为这个就是直接微型化。

59
00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:26.351
You took a big thing and you made it little.
你带来一个大东西并且把它变小。

60
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:30.896
But what I told you before about computers was that they transformed our lives
但是我之前提到了电脑改变了我们的生活，

61
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.221
when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere.
它们小到我们可以随身携带。

62
00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:39.901
So what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine?
那么在药物领域等效的转换会是什么样的呢？

63
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.456
Well, what if you had a detector
如果你有一个探测器，

64
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.742
that was so small that it could circulate in your body,
它小到可以在你的体内循环，

65
00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:50.179
find the tumor all by itself
自己找到肿瘤

66
00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:52.572
and send a signal to the outside world?
并向外面的世界传送信号会怎样呢？

67
00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.976
It sounds a little bit like science fiction.
这听起来有点像科幻小说。

68
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.903
But actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that.
但是实际上，运用纳米技术就能实现。

69
00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:04.116
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector
纳米技术可以让我们缩小探测器组成部分的尺寸，

70
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.977
from the width of a human hair,
从到发丝的宽度的大小，

71
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:07.645
which is 100 microns,
也就是100微米

72
00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.240
to a thousand times smaller,
到再小1000倍的尺度。

73
00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:12.166
which is 100 nanometers.
也就是100纳米。

74
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.000
And that has profound implications.
这就极大的扩展了应用范围。

75
00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:20.666
It turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale.
实际上在纳米级别尺寸的时候，材料的性质会发生改变。

76
00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.597
You take a common material like gold,
你拿一个常见的金属比如金，

77
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.942
and you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles,
把它研磨成灰，研磨成纳米颗粒，

78
00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.278
and it changes from looking gold to looking red.
它就会从金色外表变成红色。

79
00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:34.715
If you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide --
如果你拿一个比较稀有的材料比如硒化镉——

80
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:36.913
forms a big, black crystal --
会形成一块大的黑色晶体——

81
00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:39.538
if you make nanocrystals out of this material
如果你用这种材料做成纳米结晶，

82
00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:41.135
and you put it in a liquid,
然后把它放入液体中，

83
00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.983
and you shine light on it,
用光照一下，

84
00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:44.167
they glow.
它们就会发光。

85
00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:49.828
And they glow blue, green, yellow, orange, red,
它们可以发出蓝绿黄橙红不同的光，

86
00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:52.127
depending only on their size.
仅仅根据尺寸的不同而变化。

87
00:04:52.707 --> 00:04:56.710
It's wild! Can you imagine an object like that in the macro world?
这太疯狂了！你可以想象宏观世界有这种材料么？

88
00:04:56.734 --> 00:05:03.305
It would be like all the denim jeans in your closet are all made of cotton,
这就像你衣橱里所有的棉质牛仔裤

89
00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.640
but they are different colors depending only on their size.
依据尺寸不同，颜色也会不一样。

90
00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:09.728
(Laughter)
（笑声）

91
00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:12.326
So as a physician,
作为一位医生，

92
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.898
what's just as interesting to me is that it's not just the color of materials
让我感兴趣的不仅仅是材料的颜色

93
00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:18.853
that changes at the nanoscale;
在纳米尺寸会改变，

94
00:05:18.877 --> 00:05:22.485
the way they travel in your body also changes.
它们在人体内运动的方式也将改变。

95
00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:25.756
And this is the kind of observation that we're going to use
这也是一种我们即将使用的观察方式，

96
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.954
to make a better cancer detector.
用来制造更好的癌症检测装置。

97
00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.731
So let me show you what I mean.
下面我来解释一下。

98
00:05:30.506 --> 00:05:32.703
This is a blood vessel in the body.
这是一条人体的血管。

99
00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:35.138
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.
包裹着血管的就是肿瘤。

100
00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:38.544
We're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel
我们将要把纳米颗粒注射进血管，

101
00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:42.748
and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor.
并观察它们如何随着血流进入肿瘤。

102
00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:47.636
Now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky,
事实证明有许多肿瘤的血管是有漏洞的,

103
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.026
and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor.
所以纳米颗粒可以从血流渗漏到肿瘤中。

104
00:05:52.448 --> 00:05:55.582
Whether they leak out depends on their size.
它们是否能渗透出去取决于它们的尺寸。

105
00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.099
So in this image,
在这张图中，

106
00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:01.494
the smaller, hundred-nanometer, blue nanoparticles are leaking out,
较小的百纳米尺寸的蓝色纳米颗粒正在渗漏至血管外，

107
00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:06.715
and the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles are stuck in the bloodstream.
大一点的500纳米的红色颗粒被困在了血管中。

108
00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:08.842
So that means as an engineer,
所以这对于工程师来说，

109
00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:12.858
depending on how big or small I make a material,
取决于我所制造的材料的大小，

110
00:06:12.882 --> 00:06:15.923
I can change where it goes in your body.
我可以控制它能够去你身体里的哪一部分。

111
00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.711
In my lab, we recently made a cancer nanodetector
在我的实验室，我们最近研制出了一种癌症纳米检测器，

112
00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:26.983
that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors.
小到可以进入全身血液循环并寻找肿瘤。

113
00:06:27.297 --> 00:06:31.389
We designed it to listen for tumor invasion:
我们设计它用于监听肿瘤的侵袭：

114
00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:36.186
the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread.
即肿瘤扩散所需要的化学信号。

115
00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:39.654
For a tumor to break out of the tissue that it's born in,
一个肿瘤冲破包围它的组织时，

116
00:06:39.678 --> 00:06:42.394
it has to make chemicals called enzymes
它需要产生一种叫做酶的化学物质

117
00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:45.002
to chew through the scaffolding of tissues.
来分解组织的组成结构。

118
00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:50.305
We designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes.
我们设计了这些会被酶激发的纳米颗粒。

119
00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:56.766
One enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour.
一个酶每小时可激发一千个这种化学反应。

120
00:06:57.282 --> 00:07:02.429
Now in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio a form of amplification,
用工程术语来描述的话，我们叫它1比1000的放大比例，

121
00:07:02.453 --> 00:07:04.625
and it makes something ultrasensitive.
这就形成了一种超级灵敏的东西。

122
00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:08.482
So we've made an ultrasensitive cancer detector.
所以我们已经做了一个超灵敏的癌症检测器。

123
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.940
OK, but how do I get this activated signal to the outside world,
好的，但我如何把这激发信号传递到外界，

124
00:07:13.964 --> 00:07:15.702
where I can act on it?
好方便对其进行分析呢？

125
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:19.278
For this, we're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology,
针对这个问题，我们将采用另一项纳米生物技术，

126
00:07:19.302 --> 00:07:21.086
and that has to do with the kidney.
与肾脏有关。

127
00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:23.395
The kidney is a filter.
肾脏就是一个过滤装置。

128
00:07:23.816 --> 00:07:28.445
Its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine.
它的工作是把血液中的废物过滤出来形成尿液。

129
00:07:29.017 --> 00:07:31.679
It turns out that what the kidney filters
事实发现肾脏的过滤系统

130
00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:34.265
is also dependent on size.
也是依据（过滤物的）大小。

131
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:39.694
So in this image, what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers
所以在这个图中，你可以看到所有小于5纳米的东西

132
00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:43.823
is going from the blood, through the kidney, into the urine,
都会从血液，穿过肾，变成尿液，

133
00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:46.517
and everything else that's bigger is retained.
其他所有更大尺寸的会留下来。

134
00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:51.943
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector,
好，那如果我制造一个100纳米的癌症检测装置，

135
00:07:51.967 --> 00:07:54.439
I inject it in the bloodstream,
注射到血流中，

136
00:07:54.463 --> 00:07:59.893
it can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes
它可以渗漏到肿瘤并被肿瘤的酶激发，

137
00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:02.273
to release a small signal
释放出很小的信号，

138
00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:07.721
that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine,
小到可以被肾脏过滤出来并进入尿液中。

139
