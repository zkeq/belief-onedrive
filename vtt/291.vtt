00:16:09.849 --> 00:16:12.264
so there's no commercial interest at all.
[AI] 所以根本没有商业利益。

266
00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:16.188
The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[AI] 金稻是通过洛克菲勒基金会的支持而发展起来的。

267
00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:18.185
Again. it's being freely distributed.
[AI] 再一次它正在免费分发。

268
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:22.318
There are no commercial profits in this situation.
[AI] 在这种情况下没有商业利润。

269
00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:25.591
And now to address your other question about. well. mixing genes.
[AI] 现在来回答你的另一个问题。好混合基因。

270
00:16:25.591 --> 00:16:27.844
aren't there some unintended consequences?
[AI] 难道没有一些意想不到的后果吗？

271
00:16:27.844 --> 00:16:30.839
Absolutely -- every time we do something different.
[AI] 当然，每次我们做不同的事情。

272
00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:32.620
there's an unintended consequence.
[AI] 这是一个意想不到的后果。

273
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.647
but one of the points I was trying to make
[AI] 但我想说的一点是

274
00:16:34.647 --> 00:16:37.979
is that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants.
[AI] 我们一直在对我们的工厂做一些疯狂的事情。

275
00:16:37.979 --> 00:16:42.077
mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis.
[AI] 使用辐射或化学诱变的诱变。

276
00:16:42.077 --> 00:16:46.024
This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations.
[AI] 这导致了成千上万的非特征突变。

277
00:16:46.024 --> 00:16:49.948
and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence
[AI] 这是一个更高的意外后果风险

278
00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:51.736
than many of the modern methods.
[AI] 比许多现代方法都好。

279
00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:54.871
And so it's really important not to use the term GMO
[AI] 因此，不使用“转基因”一词非常重要

280
00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:57.587
because it's scientifically meaningless.
[AI] 因为它在科学上毫无意义。

281
00:16:57.587 --> 00:17:01.929
I feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop
[AI] 我觉得谈论一种特定的作物非常重要

282
00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:05.251
and a specific product. and think about the needs of the consumer.
[AI] 和特定的产品。并考虑消费者的需求。

283
00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:08.428
CA: So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model
[AI] CA:所以这里发生的部分事情是有一个心理模型

284
00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:12.280
in a lot of people that nature is nature. and it's pure and pristine.
[AI] 在很多人看来，自然就是自然。它是纯净的，原始的。

285
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.517
and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.
[AI] 修补它是科学怪人。

286
00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:18.163
It's making something that's pure dangerous in some way.
[AI] 它在制造一些在某种程度上纯粹危险的东西。

287
00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.504
and I think you're saying that that whole model
[AI] 我想你是说整个模型

288
00:17:20.504 --> 00:17:22.617
just misunderstands how nature is.
[AI] 只是误解了自然是怎样的。

289
00:17:22.617 --> 00:17:26.518
Nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes
[AI] 自然界是基因变化的一个更加混乱的相互作用

290
00:17:26.518 --> 00:17:28.747
that have been happening all the time anyway.
[AI] 无论如何，这种情况一直在发生。

291
00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:32.160
PR: That's absolutely true. and there's no such thing as pure food.
[AI] 公关：这是绝对正确的。没有纯食物这回事。

292
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.217
I mean. you could not spray eggplant with insecticides
[AI] 我是说。你不能用杀虫剂喷洒茄子

293
00:17:35.217 --> 00:17:38.740
or not genetically engineer it. but then you'd be stuck eating frass.
[AI] 或者不是基因工程。但你会被困在吃弗劳斯。

294
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.968
So there's no purity there.
[AI] 所以这里没有纯度。

295
00:17:40.968 --> 00:17:43.568
CA: Pam Ronald. thank you.  That was powerfully argued.
[AI] CA:帕姆·罗纳德。非常感谢。这是强有力的辩论。

296
00:17:43.568 --> 00:17:45.658
PR: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
[AI] 公关：非常感谢。我很感激。

297
