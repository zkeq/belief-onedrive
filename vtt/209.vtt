My seven-year-old grandson sleeps just down the hall from me,

"You know, this could be the best day ever."
“你知道，今天也许会是最棒的一天。”

5
00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.562
And other times, in the middle of the night,

he calls out in a tremulous voice,

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:30.366
"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"

I think this pretty much says it for me and most of the people I know,

and dread.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.622
So I sat down a few days before my 61st birthday,

12
00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:49.307
and I decided to compile a list of everything I know for sure.

13
00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:52.960
There's so little truth in the popular culture,

although this is the age I feel,

Our true person is outside of time and space,

22
00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.226
but looking at the paperwork,

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.585
I can, in fact, see that I was born in 1954.

27
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.275
although I can't help mentioning as an aside

that it might have been helpful if I hadn't followed

29
00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:41.475
the skin care rules of the '60s,

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.094
It was so liberating, though, to face the truth

that I was no longer in the last throes of middle age,

and they keep asking me what's true.

So I hope that my list of things I'm almost positive about

the first and truest thing is that all truth is a paradox.
第一个也是最真实的事情就是， 所有真相都是有对立面的。

Life is both a precious, unfathomably beautiful gift,

and it's impossible here, on the incarnational side of things.

It's been a very bad match

47

for those of us who were born extremely sensitive.

It's so hard and weird that we sometimes wonder

radical self-care is quantum,

because they don't look up,

if you don't seal it off.

00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:07.126
Do you know the first thing that God says to Moses?

He says, "Take off your shoes."

270
00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:14.939
Because this is holy ground, all evidence to the contrary.
因为你所站之地是圣地， 事实都是相反的。

271
00:14:14.963 --> 00:14:18.028
It's hard to believe, but it's the truest thing I know.
很难相信，但这是我所知道的 最真实的事情。

272
00:14:18.052 --> 00:14:22.194
When you're a little bit older, like my tiny personal self,

280
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:48.428
As Ram Dass said,
正如Ram Dass所说，

281
00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:50.312
"When all is said and done,
“说到底，

282
00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:53.336
we're really just all walking each other home."
