1
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.020
Imagine you're walking through a forest.
想象你正穿行在森林中。

2
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.916
I'm guessing you're thinking of a collection of trees,
我猜你想的是一大片树，

3
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.676
what we foresters call a stand,
我们林业工作者称之为“林分”，

4
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.340
with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns.
它们有着遒劲的枝干 和美丽的树冠。

5
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.740
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,
是的，树是森林的基础，

6
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.780
but a forest is much more than what you see,
但是森林可比你看到的复杂多了，

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.060
and today I want to change the way you think about forests.
而今天我想改变一下你们对森林的看法。

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.076
You see, underground there is this other world,
你知道吗，森林的地下是另外一个世界，

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.156
a world of infinite biological pathways
一个拥有无限的生物通路的世界，

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.596
that connect trees and allow them to communicate
这些通路把树木连接起来， 使得它们可以彼此沟通，

11
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.100
and allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism.
也使森林表现得好像一个单独的有机体。

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.580
It might remind you of a sort of intelligence.
这可能会让你想到某种程度的智慧。

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.076
How do I know this?
我是怎么知道这些的呢？

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.340
Here's my story.
来听听我的故事吧。

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.540
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia.
我是在不列颠哥伦比亚省（加拿大） 的森林中长大的。

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.076
I used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns.
那时我总喜欢躺在森林的地面上， 向上望着那些树冠。

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.340
They were giants.
它们都是巨人。

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.716
My grandfather was a giant, too.

19
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.196
He was a horse logger,
他是一名伐木工，

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.780
and he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest.
他以前曾在内陆雨林 有选择性地砍伐杉木。

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.556
Grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods,
爷爷教会我了解树木间 安静而紧密连接的沟通方式，

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.980
and how my family was knit into it.
以及我们家族是如何融入其中的。

23
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.036
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.
所以我也追随了爷爷的脚步。

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.620
He and I had this curiosity about forests,

25
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.756
and my first big "aha" moment

26
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.660
was at the outhouse by our lake.
是在我们湖边的外屋的时候。

27
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.580
Our poor dog Jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit.
我们可怜的狗吉格斯 脚一滑跌进了一个坑里。

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.036
So grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog.
爷爷匆忙抄起一把铁铲， 跑过去救那只可怜的狗。

29
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300
He was down there, swimming in the muck.
那狗掉进了深处，在淤泥里挣扎。

30
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.516
But as grandpa dug through that forest floor,
但在爷爷挖开森林的地面的时候，

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.156
I became fascinated with the roots,
我却被那些露出的树根深深地吸引了，

32
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.276
and under that, what I learned later was the white mycelium
我后来发现了，在树根下面 有很多白色的菌丝，

33
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.380
and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons.
再下面就是红色和黄色的矿质土层了。

34
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.236
Eventually, grandpa and I rescued the poor dog,
当然最终，我和爷爷 救出了那只可怜的狗，

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.596
but it was at that moment that I realized
但也就是在那时我意识到，

36
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.196
that that palette of roots and soil
正是树根和土壤的混合

37
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.660
was really the foundation of the forest.
构成了森林的基础。

38
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.860
And I wanted to know more.
于是我就想了解更多。

39
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.220
So I studied forestry.
所以我开始学习林业学。

40
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.876
But soon I found myself working alongside the powerful people
但后来很快我发现我的工作 是在那些负责商业化采集的

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780
in charge of the commercial harvest.
那些有权有势的人周围。

42
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.356
The extent of the clear-cutting
在森林中皆伐（将一片空地的树木全部砍除） 的范围

43
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.636
was alarming,
已经敲响了警钟，

44
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.820
and I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it.
我很快意识到我所处位置的矛盾性。

45
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.516
Not only that, the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches
不仅如此，为了种植更具有商业价值的 松树和冷杉，

46
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.836
to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs
从而喷死或者砍伐掉山杨和桦树的规模

47
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.060
was astounding.
也非常让人震惊。

48
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.580
It seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine.
看上去好像没什么能阻止 这些无情的工业机器了。

49
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.860
So I went back to school,
所以我回到了学校，

50
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.140
and I studied my other world.
转而研究我的“新世界”。

51
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.556
You see, scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro

52
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.716
that one pine seedling root

53
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.140
could transmit carbon to another pine seedling root.
可以将碳转移到另一颗松树的幼苗根系上。

54
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.756
But this was in the laboratory,
但这仅仅是在实验室里，

55
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.836
and I wondered, could this happen in real forests?
所以我想： 这也会发生在真正的森林里吗？

56
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.060
I thought yes.
我觉得是的。

57
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.900
Trees in real forests might also share information below ground.
在真正的森林中， 树木可能还会在地下交流信息。

58
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.716
But this was really controversial,
但这个想法其实挺有争议的，

59
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.356
and some people thought I was crazy,

60
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.436
and I had a really hard time getting research funding.

61
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.900
But I persevered,
但我坚持了下来，

62
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.876
and I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest,
而且我最终在森林的深处 成功做出了一些实验，

63
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.300
25 years ago.

64
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.836
I grew 80 replicates of three species:

65
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.036
paper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar.
有纸皮桦、花旗松和西部红杉。

66
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.116
I figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web,
我认为纸皮桦和花旗松 在地下的网络中应该是能交流的，

67
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.396
but not the cedar.
但是西部红杉应该是不行的。

68
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.940
It was in its own other world.
西部红杉比较“与世隔绝”。

69
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.116
And I gathered my apparatus,
我收拾起我的设备仪器，

70
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.316
and I had no money, so I had to do it on the cheap.

82
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.676
(Laughter)
（笑声）

83
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.300
Oh, and I forgot some stuff,

然后花旗松回应它： “啊对了，你能给我点你的碳吗？

144
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.860
Because somebody threw a shade cloth over me."
因为刚才有人用遮光布 把我罩住了。”

145
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.876
I went up to cedar, and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves,
接着我又走到西部红杉旁边， 我用盖革计数器在它的叶子旁边检测了一下，

146
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.420
and as I suspected,
结果正如我猜测的一样，

147
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.580
silence.
一片寂静。

148
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.596
Cedar was in its own world.
西部红杉还真的是与世隔绝的。

149
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.580
It was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir.
它并没有连接到纸皮桦与花旗松 互连的网络中。

150
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.940
I was so excited,
我特别激动，

151
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.796
I ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates.
我在那80棵样本之间跑来跑去， 对所有的树都进行了检测。

152
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.956
The evidence was clear.
最后的结果显而易见。

153
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.916
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me
碳13和碳14的流向告诉我

154
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.060
that paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation.
纸皮桦和花旗松之间的交流是双向的。

155
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.636
It turns out at that time of the year,
结果还表明在每年的这个时间，

156
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.876
in the summer,
在夏天的时候，

157
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.556
that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch,
纸皮桦给花旗松送的碳 比花旗松反送给它的要多，

158
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.876
especially when the fir was shaded.
特别是当花旗松见不到阳光的时候。

159
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.876
And then in later experiments, we found the opposite,
而在随后的实验中， 我们发现了相反的情况，

160
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.436
that fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir,
花旗松给纸皮桦送的碳 比纸皮桦给它的碳多，

161
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.100
and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless.
这是因为当纸皮桦树叶掉光了的时候， 花旗松还在不停的生长。

162
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.356
So it turns out the two species were interdependent,
这就说明这两种树其实是相互依赖的，

163
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.660
like yin and yang.
就像“阴”和“阳”。

164
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.756
And at that moment, everything came into focus for me.
在那个时候，事情开始变得清晰起来。

165
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.036
I knew I had found something big,
我知道我有了重大发现，

166
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.796
something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests,
这个发现可以改变我们对 森林中树木互动方式的看法，

167
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.836
from not just competitors
树木之间不仅有竞争关系，

168
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.540
but to cooperators.
同时也有合作关系。

169
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.076
And I had found solid evidence
并且我当时已经找到了

170
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.476
of this massive belowground communications network,
关于在那个世界中， 树木的巨大地下交流网络的

171
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.740
the other world.
确凿的证据。

172
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.676
Now, I truly hoped and believed
现在，我真诚地希望和相信

173
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.316
that my discovery would change how we practice forestry,
我的发现能够改变我们的林业实践活动，

174
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.116
from clear-cutting and herbiciding
能够让我们放弃皆伐和大范围的使用除草剂，

175
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.076
to more holistic and sustainable methods,
转而采用一些更全面和更可持续的方法。

176
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.316
methods that were less expensive and more practical.
这些方法更经济，也更实用。

177
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.580
What was I thinking?
当时我在想什么呢？

178
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.020
I'll come back to that.
我等一下会说到。

179
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.420
So how do we do science in complex systems like forests?
那么，在像森林这样复杂的系统中 应该怎么做科学研究呢？

180
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.876
Well, as forest scientists, we have to do our research in the forests,
其实，作为林业学家， 我们就是要实实在在地在森林里做研究，

181
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.916
and that's really tough, as I've shown you.
即使，就像我刚才给你们讲的， 你所面对的环境会非常恶劣。

182
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.180
And we have to be really good at running from bears.
我们要非常擅长于 逃脱熊的追赶。

183
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.156
But mostly, we have to persevere
但在大多数时间里，我们必须要坚持不懈，

184
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.076
in spite of all the stuff stacked against us.
即使所有的事情都跟我们作对。

185
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.716
And we have to follow our intuition and our experiences
我们必须要遵从自己的直觉和经验，

186
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.876
and ask really good questions.
然后提出有价值的问题。

187
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.076
And then we've got to gather our data and then go verify.
之后我们还得收集并且核实数据。

188
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.260
For me, I've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest.
对我来说，我在森林中已经进行和发表过 上百次的实验了。

189
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.900
Some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over 30 years old.
有一些我最早进行实验的种植园 到现在已经超过30年了。

190
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.276
You can check them out.
你可以去看看它们。

191
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.100
That's how forest science works.
这才是搞林业学应该做的事。

192
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.356
So now I want to talk about the science.
那么现在我想谈一谈科学本身了。

193
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.436
How were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating?
纸皮桦和花旗松到底是怎么交流的呢？

194
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.956
Well, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon
实际上，它们不仅仅使用碳元素 作为它们交流的语言，

195
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.996
but also nitrogen and phosphorus
其实还有氮元素和磷元素，

196
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.756
and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones --
还有水、防卫信号、 等位基因化学物和激素——

197
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.980
information.
这些都是信息。

198
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.156
And you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought
你知道吗，我得告诉你们， 在我之前的科学家们都认为

199
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.756
that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza
这种地下的互惠共生现象 是因为一种菌根

200
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.276
was involved.
介入其中的。

201
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.380
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."
菌根的字面意思就是“真菌的根部”。

202
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.076
You see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest.
当你穿行在森林中时 你经常都能看到它们的繁殖器官。

203
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.916
They're the mushrooms.
它们就是蘑菇。

204
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.956
The mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg,
而其实那些蘑菇 仅仅是冰山一角，

205
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.236
because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium,
因为从那些树干里冒出来的 菌丝生成了菌丝体，

206
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.956
and that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots
菌丝体会感染和占领

207
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.116
of all the trees and plants.
树木和植物的根。

208
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.796
And where the fungal cells interact with the root cells,
在真菌细胞和 根细胞交流的地方，

209
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.596
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,
时时刻刻都发生着为了获取营养的碳交易，

210
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.676
and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil
真菌靠着在土地里生长 并且覆盖住所有的土壤颗粒

211
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.700
and coating every soil particle.
来获取养分。

212
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.956
The web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium
这个网络无比密集以至于 在你每走过一步脚下的菌丝连起来

213
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.540
under a single footstep.
可以有几百公里长。

214
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.340
And not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest,
不仅如此，菌丝跟森林中 其它的个体也都有联系，

215
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.756
individuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir,
这种联系不仅仅在单一的种类中存在， 在不同种类之间也存在，比如纸皮桦和花旗松。

216
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.100
and it works kind of like the Internet.
而且它的工作原理就像是互联网一样。

217
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.476
You see, like all networks,
你们看，就像所有的网络一样，

218
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.316
mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.
真菌的网络中也有节点和链接。

219
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.396
We made this map by examining the short sequences of DNA
我们在一片花旗松森林中的 所有树和所有真菌中

220
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.916
of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest.
提取了它们的DNA短序列 并且制作了这份遗传图。

221
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.756
In this picture, the circles represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes,
在这张图片上，圆圈， 也就是那些节点，代表花旗松，

222
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.900
and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways, or the links.
直线，也就是那些链接， 代表着互相连接的真菌干线。

223
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.276
The biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes.
那些最大的、颜色最深的节点 就是最繁忙的、连接最多的节点。

224
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.236
We call those hub trees,
我们把它们称作中心树，

225
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.676
or more fondly, mother trees,
或者更亲切地称之为母树。

226
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.316
because it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young,
因为事实证明 这些中心树哺育着它们的小树，

227
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.876
the ones growing in the understory.
那些小树都处在林下叶层。

228
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.036
And if you can see those yellow dots,
如果你们看见那些黄色的点，

229
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.356
those are the young seedlings that have established within the network
那些就表示幼苗， 这些幼苗在这个网络中

230
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.620
of the old mother trees.
已经和它们的母树建立了联系。

231
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.420
In a single forest, a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees.
在一片森林中，一棵母树可以和 其它几百棵树建立联系。

232
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.916
And using our isotope tracers,
通过使用同位素示踪剂进行检测，

233
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.436
we have found that mother trees
我们发现那些母树

234
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.396
will send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network
会把它们多余的碳元素 通过菌根的网络

235
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.356
to the understory seedlings,
传给处在林下叶层的幼苗，

236
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.516
and we've associated this with increased seedling survival
我们发现这种方式可以让 幼苗的存活率

237
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.780
by four times.
增加四倍。

238
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.916
Now, we know we all favor our own children,
现在我们都知道， 我们爱自己的孩子，

239
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.180
and I wondered, could Douglas fir recognize its own kin,
所以我想，花旗松能认出来自己的孩子吗？

240
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.580
like mama grizzly and her cub?
就想灰熊妈妈和她的熊宝宝一样？

241
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.196
So we set about an experiment,
因此我们又设计了一个实验，

242
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.116
and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger's seedlings.
我们把母树和它们的孩子、 以及一些陌生的幼苗种在一起。

243
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.036
And it turns out they do recognize their kin.
事实证明它们认识它们的孩子。

244
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.036
Mother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks.
母树通过更大的菌根网络 来覆盖住自己孩子们所在的区域。

245
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.476
They send them more carbon below ground.
在地下，它们给孩子们会送去更多的碳。

246
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.076
They even reduce their own root competition
它们甚至会减少它们自己和其它树根部的竞争

247
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.956
to make elbow room for their kids.
来为它们的孩子们创造更多的活动空间。

248
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.636
When mother trees are injured or dying,
当母树受伤或即将枯死的时候，

249
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.180
they also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings.
它们还会把智慧信息传给下一代的幼苗。

250
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.476
So we've used isotope tracing
我们使用同位素示踪法

251
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.076
to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree
来追踪碳的走向，从一棵受伤的母树

252
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.436
down her trunk into the mycorrhizal network
树干的地方一直向下到地下的真菌网络，

253
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.460
and into her neighboring seedlings,
再到它周围的幼苗中，

254
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.236
not only carbon but also defense signals.
不仅仅是碳元素，还有防卫信号的走向。

255
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.076
And these two compounds
这两种混合物

256
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.196
have increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses.
可以给这些幼苗增加抵抗力 来面对未来的压力。

257
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.500
So trees talk.
所以树是会说话的。

258
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.396
(Applause)
（掌声）

259
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.620
Thank you.
谢谢。

260
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.556
Through back and forth conversations,
通过反反复复的对话，

261
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.260
they increase the resilience of the whole community.
它们增强了整个团体的恢复力。

262
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.076
It probably reminds you of our own social communities,
这可能会使你联想到 我们人类的社会群体，

263
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.676
and our families,
和我们的家庭，

264
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.081
well, at least some families.
当然，至少有些家庭是这样团结的。

265
00:13:09.105 --> 00:13:11.316
(Laughter)
（笑声）

266
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.245
So let's come back to the initial point.
那么，让我们回到最初的话题吧。

267
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.756
Forests aren't simply collections of trees,
森林不是简简单单的树的“集合”，

268
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.316
they're complex systems with hubs and networks
森林是拥有枢纽和网络的复杂系统，

269
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.836
that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate,
它可以承载树木并且把树连接起来， 使得它们可以互相沟通，

270
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.636
and they provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation,
它给树木提供了互相反馈的渠道 和适应的方式，

271
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.076
and this makes the forest resilient.
也使得森林的恢复力变得更强。

272
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.476
That's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks.
这是因为在森林中存在着许多的中心树 和重重叠叠的网络。

273
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.476
But they're also vulnerable,
但森林也还是很脆弱的，

274
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.380
vulnerable not only to natural disturbances
之所以脆弱不仅仅是因为 它们会受到自然界的干扰，

275
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.716
like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees
比如树皮甲虫会时不时地攻击 粗壮的老树，

276
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.180
but high-grade logging and clear-cut logging.
而是因为高强度伐木和皆伐的影响。

277
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.876
You see, you can take out one or two hub trees,
你们看，我们可以拿走一两颗中心树，

278
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.620
but there comes a tipping point,
但这样就会达到森林承受极限了，

279
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.676
because hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane.
因为森林里的中心树 就像是飞机里的铆钉。

280
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.236
You can take out one or two and the plane still flies,
你卸下一两个铆钉的话， 飞机还能飞，

281
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.836
but you take out one too many,
但是如果你一次卸下太多，

282
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.476
or maybe that one holding on the wings,
或是仅仅卸下固定机翼的那一颗铆钉，

283
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.340
and the whole system collapses.
整个系统就要崩溃了。

284
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.716
So now how are you thinking about forests? Differently?
那么现在你们对森林的看法是怎样的了？ 有些改变了吧？

285
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.956
(Audience) Yes.
（观众）是的。

286
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.180
Cool.
真棒。

287
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.060
I'm glad.
我太高兴了。

288
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.596
So, remember I said earlier that I hoped that my research,
你们还记得吧，我之前说过 我希望我的研究，

289
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.996
my discoveries would change the way we practice forestry.
我的探索可以改变一些 我们的林业实践的方式。

290
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.140
Well, I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada.
我想在30年后，在西加拿大的这个地方做个检测。

291
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.196
This is about 100 kilometers to the west of us,
这里大概是在西边距我们 100公里的地方，

292
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.580
just on the border of Banff National Park.
就在班夫国家公园的边上。

293
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.380
That's a lot of clear-cuts.
在那里到处都发生着皆伐。

294
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.280
It's not so pristine.
现在不是原始社会了。

295
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.856
In 2014, the World Resources Institute reported that Canada in the past decade
2014年，据世界资源研究所报道， 加拿大在过去十年中的

296
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.480
has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide,
森林破坏率已经达到了世界最高， 比任何一个国家都高，

297
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.160
and I bet you thought it was Brazil.
我打赌你现在肯定想到了巴西。

298
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.496
In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.
在加拿大，森林破坏率是每年3.6%。

299
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.440
Now, by my estimation, that's about four times the rate that is sustainable.
据我推算，这大概是 可持续发展的砍伐率的四倍了。

300
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.256
Now, massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles,
大规模高强度的砍伐 已经严重影响到了水循环，

301
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.256
degrade wildlife habitat,
破坏了野生动物的栖息地，

302
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.176
and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere,
而且又向大气中 释放了很多温室气体，

303
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.120
which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks.
这也会使更多的树木枯死， 造成更严重的破坏。

304
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.096
Not only that, we're continuing to plant one or two species
不仅如此，我们还在继续种植着 那一两种单一的树木，

305
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.080
and weed out the aspens and birches.
还继续着把山杨和桦树清除出去。

306
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.656
These simplified forests lack complexity,
这种单一的树木种类使森林缺少了多样性，

307
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.096
and they're really vulnerable to infections and bugs.
这让它们在传染病和虫害面前 根本不堪一击。

308
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.016
And as climate changes,
随着气候变化，

309
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.320
this is creating a perfect storm
这也将会为一些极端事件

310
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.816
for extreme events, like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak
带来一场疯狂的风暴， 比如刚刚席卷整个北美洲的

311
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.880
that just swept across North America,
山松甲虫大爆发，

312
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.960
or that megafire in the last couple months in Alberta.
还有过去几个月在阿尔伯塔的森林大火。

313
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.120
So I want to come back to my final question:
所以现在我想提 我的最后一个问题：

314
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.576
instead of weakening our forests,
与破坏我们的森林相反，

315
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.160
how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change?
我们怎么才能让它们变得更强大， 怎么才能帮助它们应对气候变化呢？

316
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.536
Well, you know, the great thing about forests as complex systems
其实你们知道吗，森林作为一个复杂的系统 最好的一点就是

317
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.600
is they have enormous capacity to self-heal.
它们拥有相当强大的自愈能力。

318
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.936
In our recent experiments,
在我们最近几个实验中，

319
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.416
we found with patch-cutting and retention of hub trees
我们发现小规模的砍伐， 把中心树保护好，

320
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.576
and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes
物种多样性、 基因和基因型多样性的再生，

321
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.440
that these mycorrhizal networks, they recover really rapidly.
加上这些真菌网络的存在， 会使森林的恢复速度变得无比迅速。

322
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.096
So with this in mind, I want to leave you with four simple solutions.
所以出于这种考虑， 我想提出四个简单的解决方法。

323
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.480
And we can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on.
而且我们一定不能自欺欺人， 因为这些做起来其实也挺复杂的。

324
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.200
First, we all need to get out in the forest.
首先，我们都得走出家门，走进森林。

325
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.856
We need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests.
我们需要重新使当地的居民 融入到我们森林中去。

326
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.496
You see, most of our forests now
其实，现在我们的大部分林业实践

327
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.736
are managed using a one-size-fits-all approach,
采用的都是一体通用的方法，

328
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.120
but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions.
但是优秀的森林管理员是需要具备 关于当地环境情况的知识的。

329
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.920
Second, we need to save our old-growth forests.
第二，我们需要保护好我们的古老森林。

330
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.560
These are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.
保护好它们就是保护好了森林的基因库、 保护好了母树和菌根网络。

331
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.696
So this means less cutting.
这就意味着我们需要减少砍伐。

332
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.760
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.
我不是说不伐树了，而是少伐。

333
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.455
And third, when we do cut,
第三，当我们伐木时，

334
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.280
we need to save the legacies,
我们需要保护森林的“遗产”——

335
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.536
the mother trees and networks,
母树和菌根网络，

336
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.695
and the wood, the genes,
还有树干和基因，

337
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.616
so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees
这样它们就能把它们的智慧 传给下一代的树木，

338
00:17:24.639 --> 00:17:27.760
so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road.
这样整个森林就能禁得起 未来将会面对的重重困难了。

339
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.520
We need to be conservationists.
我们都需要做自然环境保护者。

340
00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:34.359
And finally, fourthly and finally,
最后，第四点，也是最后一点，

341
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.616
we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species
我们需要通过人工种植和自然再生的方式，

342
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.856
and genotypes and structures
增加森林的物种多样性、

343
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.640
by planting and allowing natural regeneration.
基因型多样性和结构多样性。

344
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.336
We have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs
我们需要给大自然母亲 她需要的工具，

345
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.080
to use her intelligence to self-heal.
好让她用自己的智慧来进行自愈。

346
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.056
And we need to remember that forests aren't just a bunch of trees
我们需要明白， 森林不仅仅是一堆树

347
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.336
competing with each other,
在互相竞争，

348
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.280
they're supercooperators.
它们是无比优秀的合作者。

349
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.176
So back to Jigs.
让我们的话题回到吉格斯。

350
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.656
Jigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world,
那次吉格斯掉进了坑里的经历 让我见识到了另一个世界，

351
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.376
and it changed my view of forests.
而这件事完全改变了我对森林的看法。

352
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.736
I hope today to have changed how you think about forests.
我希望今天我也能改变 你们的一些关于森林的印象。

353
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.016
Thank you.
谢谢。

354
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.817
(Applause)
