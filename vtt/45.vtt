名叫《流言终结者》。

142
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:01.443
And over 14 years,
在超过14年里，

143
00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:04.565
I learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies
我在工作中学习到 如何设计实验方法，

144
00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:07.244
and how to tell stories about them for television.
学会了在电视上 讲述有关实验的故事。

145
00:06:07.616 --> 00:06:09.319
I also learn early on
我很早就意识到，

146
00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:12.202
that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling.
戏服在这种讲述过程中 可以有很重要的作用。

147
00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:16.261
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color
我用戏服来增添 幽默感、喜剧感、画面感，

148
00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:19.308
and narrative clarity to the stories we're telling.
并且可以更清晰地叙述 我们所讲的故事。

149
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.514
And then we do an episode called "Dumpster Diving,"
后来我们拍了一集， 名叫“垃圾箱缓冲”，

150
00:06:22.538 --> 00:06:24.805
and I learn a little bit more
从中我也学到了一些东西，

151
00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:28.260
about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me.
了解了戏服扮演对我来说 有什么更深层次的意义。

152
00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:29.880
In the episode "Dumpster Diving,"
在“垃圾箱缓冲”这一集，

153
00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:31.859
the question we were trying to answer is:
我们想要解答的问题是：

154
00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:33.526
Is jumping into a dumpster as safe
跳进一个大垃圾箱里

155
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.526
as the movies would lead you to believe?
真的像电影里拍的那样安全吗？

156
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.324
(Laughter)
（笑声）

157
00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:39.983
The episode was going to have two distinct parts to it.
这一集有两个不同的重点部分。

158
00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:43.102
One was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman
其一，我们在专业特技演员的 辅导下学会从高楼上跳下，

159
00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:44.419
into an air bag.
跳进一个气垫里。

160
00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:46.924
And the second was the graduation to the experiment:
其二，才是真实场景的实验：

161
00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.793
we'd fill a dumpster full of material and we'd jump into it.
我们把一个垃圾箱装满杂物， 然后纵身跳进去。

162
00:06:49.817 --> 00:06:52.104
I wanted to visually separate these two elements,
我想从视觉上把这两个部分区分开，

163
00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:53.285
and I thought,
我就想：

164
00:06:52.835 --> 00:06:57.023
"Well, for the first part we're training, so we should wear sweatsuits --
“好吧，我们的第一部分是训练， 所以我们要穿训练服——

165
00:06:57.017 --> 00:07:00.765
Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' on the back of the sweatsuits.
哦！我们在训练服背上 写上‘特技初学者’吧。

166
00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:02.133
That's for the training."
这是训练部分用的。”

167
00:07:02.157 --> 00:07:05.522
But for the second part, I wanted something really visually striking --
但是到第二部分， 我想让视觉冲击特别强——

168
00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:08.024
"I know! I'll dress as Neo from 'The Matrix.'"
“我知道了！我要扮演成 《黑客帝国》里的尼欧！”

169
00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:09.122
(Laughter)
（笑声）

170
00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:10.456
So I went to Haight Street.
于是我去了海特街。

171
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.059
I bought some beautiful knee-high, buckle boots.

172
00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:15.525
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.
我在易趣网找到了件潇洒至极的斗篷。

173
00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:19.270
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear.
我买了墨镜，我得带上 隐形眼镜之后才能戴墨镜。

174
00:07:19.294 --> 00:07:21.274
The day of the experiment shoot comes up,
拍摄真实场景实验的那天终于到了，

175
00:07:20.994 --> 00:07:22.886
and I step out of my car in this costume,

176
00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:24.940
and my crew takes a look at me ...
我的同事们瞅了我一眼……

177
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.219
and start suppressing their church giggles.
然后所有人都强忍着笑声。

178
00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:31.807
They're like, "(Laugh sound)."
他们就像这样： “（噗嗤）”

179
00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:34.262
And I feel two distinct things at this moment.

180
00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.983
I feel total embarrassment
我感觉到彻头彻尾的尴尬，

181
00:07:36.007 --> 00:07:38.753
over the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew

182
00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:41.419
that I'm completely into wearing this costume.
我穿这套衣服实在是太“入戏”了。

183
00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:42.593
(Laughter)
（笑声）

184
00:07:43.148 --> 00:07:46.368
But the producer in my mind reminds myself

185
00:07:46.392 --> 00:07:48.819
that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,

Five years into the "MythBusters" run,

we got invited to appear at San Diego Comic-Con.

我一直以来都了解漫展， 但是从来没时间去。

I decided that I would put together an elaborate costume

that covered me completely,

197
00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:20.377
and I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.

198
00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.719
The costume I chose?

200
00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:24.464
That's not my costume,

00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:25.639
that's actually Hellboy.
这是电影里的地狱男爵。

202
00:08:25.663 --> 00:08:26.682
(Laughter)
（笑声）

203
00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:27.864
But I spent months

204
00:08:27.888 --> 00:08:30.728
assembling the most screen-accurate Hellboy costume I could,

205
00:08:30.752 --> 00:08:32.687
from the boots to the belt to the pants
从靴子到皮带到裤子，

206
00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:34.099
to the right hand of doom.

I found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest

I even had contact lenses made in my prescription.

I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con

212
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:50.653

213
00:08:50.677 --> 00:08:52.712
Sweating! I should've remembered this.
我满头大汗！我早该吸取教训的！

214
00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:55.625
I'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,
我的汗都流成河了， 然后隐形眼镜刺得我眼睛痛，

215
00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:59.198
and none of it matters because I'm totally in love.
但是我根本顾不上， 因为我简直爱它到不能自拔。

216
00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:00.372
(Laughter)

Not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor,
这并不只是把戏服穿上， 然后在展厅里溜达那么简单，

00:09:04.473 --> 00:09:08.052
but also with the community of other costumers.

It's not called costuming at Cons,

it's called "cosplay."

Now ostensibly, cosplay means people who dress up

as their favorite characters from film and television

00:09:17.895 --> 00:09:20.980
but it is so much more than that.
但其中的意义比这多得多。

225
00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:24.015
These aren't just people who find a costume and put it on --

226
00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:25.436

（笑声）

232
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.601
But more than that,
但还不止这些，

233
00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.078
they rehearse their costumes.

235
00:09:40.602 --> 00:09:43.149
you don't just take pictures of people walking around.

236
00:09:42.969 --> 00:09:44.038
You go up and say,

237
00:09:44.352 --> 00:09:46.804
"Hey, I like your costume, can I take your picture?"
“嘿！我好喜欢你的戏服， 能给你拍个照吗？”

They've worked hard on their pose

242
00:09:56.998 --> 00:09:58.429

00:09:58.453 --> 00:09:59.959
At subsequent Cons,

I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --

that head laugh that Chewbacca does.

之后，我扮演成 《千与千寻》里的无面人。

250
00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:20.894
If you don't know about "Spirited Away" and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,
如果你还不知道《千与千寻》 和它的创作者宫崎骏，

252
00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:23.543

This is a masterpiece, and one of my all-time favorite films.
这是一部巨作， 也是我最喜爱的电影之一。

258
00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:39.894
a captured dragon named Haku

259
00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:42.182
and a lonely demon named No-Face.

But this doesn't go very well,

265

until Chihiro saves him,

So I put together a No-Face costume,

and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.

I resolved I would not speak in this costume at all.

“我的天啊！无面人的金币！ 好家伙，这简直太帅了！”

281
00:11:35.935 --> 00:11:39.325
And I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic.
我沉浸在这种感觉中， 这样走在漫展上真的太棒了。

282
00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:42.603
And about 15 minutes in something happens.

283
00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:45.214
Somebody grabs my hand,

284
00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:47.912
and they put a coin back into it.

285
00:11:47.936 --> 00:11:51.132
And I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift,
我在想他们是不是 给我一块金币作为回礼，

286
00:11:51.156 --> 00:11:53.689
but no, this is one of the coins that I'd given away.
但是不对啊， 这是我给出去的一块金币。

287
00:11:54.049 --> 00:11:55.500
I don't know why.

288
00:11:55.524 --> 00:11:57.772
And I keep on going, I take some more pictures.
我继续发金币， 继续跟大家合照。

289
00:11:57.796 --> 00:11:59.247
And then it happens again.

290
00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:02.970
Understand, I can't see anything inside this costume.
要说明一下，我在戏服里 是看不见东西的。

00:12:02.994 --> 00:12:04.481
I can see through the mouth --

292
00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:06.124
I can see people's shoes.
但我只能看到鞋子。

293
00:12:06.148 --> 00:12:08.963
I can hear what they're saying and I can see their feet.

294
00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:11.257
But the third time someone gives me back a coin,

I want to know what's going on.

296
00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:16.491
So I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view,
所以我把头向后仰，让视野更清晰，

297
00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:19.829
and what I see is someone walking away from me going like this.
我看到的是人们像这样避开我行走。

298
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:23.593
And then it hits me:

299
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.053
it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.
拿无面人的金币是一种凶兆。

300
00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:29.989
In the film "Spirited Away,"

301
00:12:29.973 --> 00:12:33.410
bad luck befalls those who take gold from No-Face.

303
00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:43.888
We are, all of us on that floor,

304
00:12:43.912 --> 00:12:47.245
injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us.

305
00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:49.428
And we're making it our own.

306
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:53.552
We're connecting with something important inside of us.

307
00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:57.912
And the costumes are how we reveal ourselves
而戏服正是我们向他人

308
00:12:57.936 --> 00:12:59.119
to each other.
展现自己的方式。

Thank you.
