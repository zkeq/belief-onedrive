1
00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:16.186
I first tried online dating my freshman year of college,
大学一年级时， 我第一次尝试网上约会，

2
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.502
which was in 2001, in case you can't see my wrinkle.
那是在2001年， 我承认这么说有些暴露年龄。

3
00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.516
Now, as you may have noticed, I'm six-feet tall,
你可能已注意到 我的身高有一米八，

4
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.525
and when I arrived at my chosen university
当我进入大学校园时，

5
00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:28.865
and realized our men's Division III basketball team averaged five-foot-eight,
就意识到校男子篮球队（第三区） 队员的平均身高也才一米七多点儿，

6
00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:32.246
I abandoned the on-campus scene and went online.
所以就当机立断放弃校园约会， 而选择了网上约会。

7
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.998
Now, back then, online dating was pretty close to the plot
那会儿的网上约会，像极了电影

8
00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.316
of "You've Got Mail."
《电子情书》里的情节。

9
00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.437
You'd write long emails back and forth for weeks,
你会连续好几周 写很多很长的邮件，

10
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:41.436
before you finally met up in real life.
才最终决定约出来见面。

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.199
Except, in my case, you'd realize you have no chemistry
除了在我的例子里， 意识到俩人根本不来电后，

12
00:00:44.223 --> 00:00:46.492
and so now, you're back to square one.
一切又回到原点。

13
00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:49.897
So, while online dating has changed a lot in the last 17 years,
虽然过去17年里 网上约会已经改变了很多，

14
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:52.654
many of the frustrations remain the same.
但其中很多问题依然存在。

15
00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.373
Because here's what it does well.
以下是网约软件做得好的地方：

16
00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:57.849
It broadens your pool of potential dates
它超越你现有的社交和工作圈，

17
00:00:57.873 --> 00:01:00.825
beyond your existing social and professional circles.
拓宽了潜在约会对象群；

18
00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.348
And here's what it doesn't do well.
这是它做的不好的地方：

19
00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:06.119
Literally everything else.
除了以上那条之外的所有方面。

20
00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:07.703
(Laughter)
（笑声）

21
00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:09.977
A few things you should know about me:
我先做个自我介绍：

22
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:13.335
I'm an action-oriented overachieving math and theater nerd,
我是一个行动派， 数学超好，而且是个戏剧迷。

23
00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:14.897
who ended up with an MBA.
还有一个工商管理硕士学位。

24
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.072
So, when things aren't working out, I tend to take a step back,
所以当事情发展不顺时， 我一般会选择以退为进，

25
00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.533
apply my business toolkit to figure out why, and to fix it.
运用我的商业技能工具 找出问题并解决它。

26
00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.119
My love life was no exception.
我的感情生活也不例外。

27
00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:28.289
The summer before I turned 30, I took myself on a relationship off-site.
在我即将30岁那一个夏天， 我给自己的感情生活放了个假，

28
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.049
Which means I went camping solo in Maine for a week,
去缅因州独自露营了一周，

29
00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:34.679
to do a retro on my track record of mediocre relationships.
回顾了自己平凡的感情经历。

30
00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.055
Because the thing was, I knew what I wanted in a partner.
事实是，我很清楚 自己想要什么样的伴侣。

31
00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:42.025
Kindness, curiosity, empathy, a sense of purpose.
善良、有好奇心、同理心， 还要心怀大志。

32
00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:45.627
And yet, here's what I chose for online:
但是，我在网上写的 要求却是这样的：

33
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:48.468
Ivy League degree, six feet or taller,
常青藤大学毕业、身高一米八或以上，

34
00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:50.532
lives within 12 subway stops of me.
与我居住的地方 距离不超过12个地铁站。

35
00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:53.830
It's not that I intentionally prioritized those things,
我不是故意要 把那些东西摆在首位，

36
00:01:53.854 --> 00:01:57.024
it's just the easiest to vet for online.
而是这样的描述在网上最容易筛查。

37
00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:58.818
It kind of is like a résumé review,
它类似于一种简历的审阅，

38
00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:01.207
which is why these guys looked great on paper
这就是为什么这些男人 把自己写得那么棒，

39
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.764
and never quite fit me.
却始终不适合我。

40
00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:05.841
So when I went back online in the spring of 2016,
所以2016年春季， 我再次回归网上约会时，

41
00:02:05.865 --> 00:02:10.326
I decided to reengineer the process through some classic business tools.
我决定用经典的商业手段 来调整我的作战策略。

42
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.365
First, I went to OkCupid,
首先我登陆了OkCupid，

43
00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.667
because I wanted to avoid the gamification of swipe-based apps.
因为我不想再用那些像游戏一样、 需要不停滑动手机屏幕的软件，

44
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:18.262
And also, because I wanted a writing sample.
而且还因为，我想要一份写作样本。

45
00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.072
Next, I set up a sales funnel,
接着我建立了一个销售漏斗模型，

46
00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:23.183
throwing out any sense of my type,
列出了我想要的方方面面，

47
00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:27.016
and instead defining the criteria that would qualify a lead.
并且直接提供了符合要求的参考标准。

48
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.207
An inbound message had to do three things:
给我私信可以，但要做到三件事：

49
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:32.397
had to be written in complete sentences and with good grammar;
句子完整而语法无误，

50
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.498
it had to reference something in my profile,
还须提到我的 个人简介里的一些内容，

51
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:36.826
so I know it's not a copy-and-paste situation;
以此证明这不是复制粘贴，

52
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.626
and it had to avoid all sexual content.
并且还不能出现色情内容。

53
00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:41.731
I figured this was a pretty low bar,
我想这门槛已经很低了吧，

54
00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:44.254
but it turns out, of my 210 inbound messages,
但事实证明，在收到的210条私信里，

55
00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:46.667
only 14 percent cleared that hurdle.
只有14%的人全部符合要求。

56
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:47.857
(Laughter)
（笑声）

57
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:51.127
Next, I wanted to meet in real life as quickly as possible,
接下来，我要在 现实生活中尽快见到他们，

58
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:54.143
because the things I cared about, I couldn't see online.
因为网上看不出他们是否 具备我所在意的那些品质。

59
00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:55.929
But the research, and my experience,
但根据研究以及自身经验得出，

60
00:02:55.953 --> 00:02:59.934
shows you only need about 30 seconds with someone to tell if you click.
你跟某人在一起只需要30秒， 就能确定彼此来不来电。

61
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.543
So I invented the zero date.
所以我发明了“零次约会”。

62
00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.552
The zero date is one drink, one hour.
意思就是：一杯饮料、一个小时。

63
00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:08.508
With the goal of answering one question:
目的就为了回答一个问题：

64
00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.969
Would I like to have dinner with this person?
“我想和这个人共进晚餐吗？”

65
00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:12.373
Not "are they the one"?
而非“他们是我要找的人吗？”

66
00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:15.793
Literally, "Would I like to spend three hours across the table
真的只是，“我想和他在餐桌旁

67
00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:16.967
from this person?"
呆三小时吗？”

68
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.619
You tell them you have a hard stop --
要提前说好，时间一到 就要立即停止——

69
00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:22.286
drinks with girlfriends, a conference call with China --
说约了别的女性朋友也好， 与中国那边有个视像会议也罢——

70
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.963
it doesn't matter, they don't know you.
这些都不重要，他们根本无从考证。

71
00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:26.246
The point is one hour.
关键是这一小时。

72
00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:28.945
If it's awesome, you schedule a first date.
如果感觉很棒的话， 那就计划第一次约会；

73
00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.111
And if it's not awesome, you downshift into entertainer mode
如果感觉不好的话， 那就权且当作娱乐，

74
00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:35.294
and you workshop a few new stories for your next networking event.
为下次网约添几个新段子而已。

75
00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:39.183
Plus, because it's just an hour, you can squeeze up to three in one evening
另外，因为仅仅只有一个小时， 所以你一晚上可以约三个人，

76
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:42.433
and then you only have to do your hair and pick out one great outfit a week.
唯一要做的就是弄好发型， 然后选一套一周里最好看的衣服。

77
00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:46.040
The zero date also gave me a chance to see how they responded
零次约会还能让我看到 对方面对我的邀约

78
00:03:45.894 --> 00:03:47.694
to me asking them out.
会作何反应。

79
00:03:47.754 --> 00:03:50.976
I figured not everyone would dig my moxie, and I was right.
我猜想，不会每个人 都吃我这一套，而事实证明我猜对了。

80
00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:54.897
Of my 29 qualified leads, only 15 replied to my message,
在精心挑选的29个人里， 只有15个人回了我的短信，

81
00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:57.588
and of those, six scheduled a zero date.
而在这15个人里， 只有6人和我进行了“零次约会”。

82
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.135
My first zero date was with a set designer.
我第一次“零次约会”的对象 是一名布景设计师。

83
00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.413
And we were both into yoga
我们都喜欢练瑜伽，

84
00:04:01.437 --> 00:04:03.488
and preferred our bagels with peanut butter,
都喜欢吃花生酱味的百吉饼，

85
00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:04.972
so it looked pretty promising.
所以这一切看起来都挺有希望的。

86
00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:07.916
But two minutes in, I could tell it wasn't going to be a thing
但两分钟之后我感觉没什么戏了，

87
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.488
and I was relieved not to be spending dinner with him.
不用跟他吃晚餐， 让我松了一口气。

88
00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:13.857
After that, I was a little nervous about going to my next zero date.
之后我对第二次的 “零次约会“有些紧张。

89
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:16.690
But we had agreed to meet on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade
但我们已经约好了在 布鲁克林高地步道见面，

90
00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:18.778
with a flask of whiskey to watch the sunset,
带上威士忌、一起欣赏日落。

91
00:04:18.802 --> 00:04:21.222
and honestly, it was two blocks from my apartment.
实话说，约会地点 离我的公寓只有两个街区。

92
00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:24.151
Plus, this guy had a podcast, I have a podcast,
而且，他有播客，我也有，

93
00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:27.127
worst case scenario, we can talk about our podcasts.
所以，最糟糕的情况 也不过是聊聊彼此的播客。

94
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.034
Then, Chas set down next to me.
然后，查斯在我身边坐下，

95
00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:32.486
And this kind and empathetic man
这个善良、富有同理心的男人

96
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.587
told great jokes and asked even better questions.
讲了很棒的笑话， 还问了更好的问题。

97
00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:39.814
He was a lawyer and a writer, and his eyes twinkled when he laughed
他是一名律师兼作家， 笑得时候眼睛都闪烁着光芒，

98
00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:41.846
and they squeezed tight when I kissed him
在我亲他的时候，又会紧紧闭上，

99
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.298
and at some point in the evening, our zero date became a first date.
所以某种程度上，当晚的“零次约会” 成了我们的“第一次约会”。

100
00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:49.393
And two years later, we have a washer, dryer and two house plants together.
两年以后，我们拥有了共同的 洗衣机、吹风机和两盆室内盆栽。

101
00:04:49.884 --> 00:04:53.201
Now, I can't promise you're going to end up with house plants.
我不能保证你们最后 也会有两盆室内盆栽，

102
00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:54.950
But the point of this story
但我想说的是，

103
00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:57.685
is that online dating doesn't have to suck.
网上约会不一定总会很差劲。

104
00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:01.232
Don't treat it like a game, and don't treat it like a resume review.
不要把它当作一种游戏， 但也不要像筛简历一样。

105
00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:04.049
Instead, use it to source and qualify leads
相反，要把它当作 搜集优质人选的过程，

106
00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:07.530
and then get offline as quickly as possible with the zero date.
然后尽快进行线下的“零次约会”，

107
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.859
Because the point of this isn't swiping.
因为网上约会的目的 不是滑动手机屏幕而已，

108
00:05:10.883 --> 00:05:12.517
It's finding your person.
而是找到那个对的人。

109
00:05:13.264 --> 00:05:14.415
Good luck.
祝大家好运。

110
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.005
(Applause)
