00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:14.158
One of my earliest memories
我早年间的一个回忆

2
00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:17.278
is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to.
就是试图去叫醒一个亲戚，但却叫不醒他

3
00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:20.255
And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why,
我当时只是一个小孩，并不知道为什么

4
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.589
but as I got older,
当我长大了后

5
00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:23.756
I realized we had drug addiction in my family,
我意识到我们家里有人吸毒上瘾了

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.614
including later cocaine addiction.
到后来吸可卡因上瘾了

7
00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:30.417
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years
我最近常常想这个问题，可能是因为现在是

8
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:33.511
since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain,
毒品第一次在美国和英国被禁止的第100年

9
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.026
and we then imposed that on the rest of the world.
我们接下来将这一项禁令推广到了全世界

10
00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:39.570
It's a century since we made this really fateful decision
我们做这一项生死攸关的决定已经有一个世纪了

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.623
to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer,
对上瘾者进行惩罚，使他们痛苦

12
00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:48.034
because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop.
因为我们认为这样能够阻止他们，给他们一个停下来的激励

13
00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:53.027
And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love,
几年之前，我看着那些在我身边的至亲，饱受毒瘾困扰

14
00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:56.440
and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them.
想找到一些能够帮助他们的方法

15
00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:59.714
And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions
然后发现，有许多难以置信的问题

16
00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:01.548
I just didn't know the answer to,
我不知道如何回答

17
00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:03.988
like, what really causes addiction?
比如，什么造成了上瘾

18
00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:07.428
Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working,
为什么我们仍在使用这种看起来并不管用的方法

19
00:01:07.452 --> 00:01:10.357
and is there a better way out there that we could try instead?
是否还有一种更好的方法值得我们尝试？

20
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:12.071
So I read loads of stuff about it,
我读了很多相关资料，

21
00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:14.762
and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for,
然而却不能找到我想要的答案

22
00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:18.322
so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world
所以我想，好吧，就去见见那些世界上各种

23
00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:20.010
who lived this and studied this
以此为生的人和研究这些问题的专家

24
00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.107
and talk to them and see if I could learn from them.
和他们聊聊看是否能够从他们中找到答案

25
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.076
And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start,
我一开始没想到自己最后竟然一走就是30,000多英里

26
00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.424
but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people,
遇见了许多不同的人

27
00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:29.745
from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn,
从布鲁克林区布朗斯维尔的变性毒贩

28
00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:34.640
to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses
到花了许多时间喂猫鼬致幻剂，

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.383
to see if they like them --
看它们是否对此感兴趣的科学家

30
00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.756
it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances --
结果是它们确实对此感兴趣，但只在特定的情况下

31
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.930
to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal.
我也去了唯一一个对所有毒品合法化的国家，葡萄牙在那从毒品到大麻都无罪

32
00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:47.531
And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is,
真正让我震惊的事情是

33
00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:51.339
almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong,
我们对毒瘾的认知几乎是全部错误的

34
00:01:51.363 --> 00:01:54.450
and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction,
如果我们开始吸纳关于毒瘾的新的证据

35
00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:57.896
I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies.
我认为我们得改变包括毒品政策在内的许多东西

36
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.321
But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew.
但让我们先从我们认识的，我之前所以为的开始

37
00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:03.426
Let's think about this middle row here.
想象中间这一排

38
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.212
Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day.
想象你们从今天开始的20天，每天吸食海洛因三次

39
00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:10.681
Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect.
有些人听到这看起来比较兴奋啊

40
00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:11.705
(Laughter)
（笑声）

41
00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:13.934
Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment.
别担心，这只是假想试验

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.039
Imagine you did that, right?
想象你们这么做，好吗？

43
00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:17.213
What would happen?
会发生什么？

44
00:02:16.948 --> 00:02:20.765
Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.
这样的后果——过去的一百年我们都是如此被告知的

45
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.586
We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin,
我们认为由于海洛因包含了化学致瘾剂

46
00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:25.349
as you took it for a while,
当你服用了一段时间之后

47
00:02:25.373 --> 00:02:27.927
your body would become dependent on those hooks,
你的身体就会对它形成依赖

48
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.715
you'd start to physically need them,
你开始从生理上需要它

49
00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.063
and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
20天后，你们所有人都会海洛因上瘾。对吗？

50
00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:34.319
That's what I thought.
这是我过去认为的

51
00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:39.879
First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me.
第一件事，让我想到我们过去一直认为的后果其实是错误的

52
00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:43.618
If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,
如果我今天走出TED Talk剧场，被车撞了，摔坏了髋关节

53
00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:46.955
I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.
我会被送到医院，注射很多的二乙酰吗啡

54
00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.541
Diamorphine is heroin.
二乙酰吗啡就是海洛因

55
00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.999
It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets,
甚至比你在街上买的品质更好

56
00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:54.955
because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated.
因为你从毒贩那买的已经被污染了

57
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.803
Actually, very little of it is heroin,
事实上，只有一小部分是海洛因

58
00:02:56.827 --> 00:02:59.643
whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.
然而你从医生那拿的是医用纯度的

59
00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:02.239
And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time.
而且你还需要用上很长一段时间

60
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.720
There are loads of people in this room,
这间房里有许多的人

61
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.571
you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin.
你们可能没有意识到你们已经摄入了很多的海洛因

62
00:03:05.571 --> 00:03:08.446
And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening.
屏幕前面的各位也是一样，这已经发生了

63
00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:10.975
And if what we believe about addiction is right --
如果我们对毒瘾的想法是对的

64
00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:13.117
those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks --
那些人都暴露在化学致瘾剂前

65
00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.030
What should happen? They should become addicts.
会发生什么呢？他们应该成为瘾君子

66
00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:19.856
This has been studied really carefully.
这项研究非常谨慎

67
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.785
It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement,
你不会发现，当你的祖母换了一个髋关节后

68
00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.081
she didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter)
就成为了瘾君子（笑声）

69
00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:29.446
And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me,
当我知道这一点之后，我觉得很奇怪

70
00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.532
so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew,
与我之前所听的，所知道的都相反

71
00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:34.473
I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.
我认为这不可能，直到我遇到一个叫布鲁斯·亚历山大的人

72
00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:36.545
He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver
他是一个温哥华的心理学教授

73
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:38.725
who carried out an incredible experiment
正在进行一项不可思议的实验

74
00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.230
I think really helps us to understand this issue.
这项实验可能帮助我们理解这个问题

75
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.549
Professor Alexander explained to me,
亚历山大教授向我解释道，

76
00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.643
the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story,
我们过去对毒瘾的了解

77
00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:48.436
comes partly from a series of experiments
很多时候是因为在20世纪早期

78
00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:49.962
that were done earlier in the 20th century.
做的一系列实验

79
00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.301
They're really simple.
实验都很简单

80
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:54.455
You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.
你回家后今晚就可以做，如果你有一点虐待狂的话

81
00:03:54.455 --> 00:03:58.111
You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles:
你把老鼠放到笼子里，给它两个水杯

82
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:04.305
One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.
一杯放水，另一杯添加海洛因或可卡因

83
00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:06.052
If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water
如果你这么做，老鼠总是会选择有毒品的那一杯

84
00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:08.348
and almost always kill itself quite quickly.
常常会导致自己死亡

85
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.699
So there you go, right? That's how we think it works.
对吧，这就是我们如何上瘾的

86
00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.014
In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment
在70年代，亚历山大教授开始注意这些实验

87
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.876
and he noticed something.
他发现了一些问题

88
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.379
He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage.
他说，我们把老鼠放在了一个空的笼子里

89
00:04:19.403 --> 00:04:21.636
It's got nothing to do except use these drugs.
它们除了毒品做不了别的事情

90
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.175
Let's try something different.
让我试一试其它的事情

91
00:04:22.702 --> 00:04:26.051
So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park,"
所以亚历山大教授建造了一个笼子，他称之为“老鼠公园”

92
00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:28.667
which is basically heaven for rats.
那是一个老鼠的天堂

93
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:31.770
They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls,
在那有很多的奶酪、彩球

94
00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:33.178
they've got loads of tunnels.
还有很多的隧道

95
00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:36.393
Crucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex.
最重要的是，它们在那又很多的同伴，方便交配

96
00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:41.207
And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.
它们也有两个杯子，装着普通的水和有毒品的水

97
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.916
But here's the fascinating thing:
但有趣的事情是

98
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.398
In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.
在老鼠公园，它们并不喜欢有毒品的水

99
00:04:47.422 --> 00:04:49.111
They almost never use it.
它们基本上不喝

100
00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:51.688
None of them ever use it compulsively.
它们中没有出现不得不喝的老鼠

101
00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:53.113
None of them ever overdose.
也没有过量服用的

102
00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:56.527
You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated
当他们被隔离时，百分之百的都过量服用了毒品

103
00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:59.777
to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives.
而当它们过着开心并与外界交往的生活时，比例是零

104
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.047
Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought,
当亚历山大教授第一眼看到这个现象的时候想

105
00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:06.332
maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us.
也许这个只是老鼠的情况，与我们的不同

106
00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:08.811
Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know --
但也许并不是与我们想象的那样不同

107
00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:10.946
But fortunately, there was a human experiment
但幸运的是，有一个人类实验

108
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.075
into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time.
基于同样的原则，在同一个时间

109
00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.077
It was called the Vietnam War.
那就是越南战争

110
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:20.684
In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin,
在越南，20%的美国军队使用了许多的海洛因

111
00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:23.316
and if you look at the news reports from the time,
如果你看看当时的新闻报道

112
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.998
they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have
他们非常的担心，因为他们觉得战争结束以后

113
00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:29.704
hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States
会有成百上千的瘾君子出现在美国的街头

114
00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:32.186
when the war ends; it made total sense.
这些担心都是符合常理的

115
00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.472
Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home.
如今这些当年服用海洛因的士兵回家

116
00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.450
The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study,
普通心理学杂志做了一个详细的研究

117
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.335
and what happened to them?
他们发生了什么？

118
00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:43.986
It turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal.
结果是他们没有去戒毒中心

119
00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:47.272
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.
95%的人就停止吸毒了

120
00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:49.697
Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks,
如果你相信化学制瘾的解释，这根本讲不通

121
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.185
that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think
但是亚历山大教授开始思考

122
00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.516
there might be a different story about addiction.
也许上瘾可以有另一种解释

123
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.381
He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks?
他说，如果上瘾与化学制瘾物无关呢？

124
00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:01.051
What if addiction is about your cage?
如果上瘾是因为你的笼子呢？

125
00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:04.189
What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?
如果上瘾其实是一种对环境的适应呢？

126
00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:05.363
Looking at this,
看看接下来这个案例

127
00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:08.465
there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands
另一个叫作彼得·科恩的荷兰教授

128
00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:10.936
who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction.
认为我们不应该称之为上瘾

129
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.684
Maybe we should call it bonding.
也许我们应该称之为依赖

130
00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:15.607
Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond,
人类对于依赖有一种先天与自然的需要

131
00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:19.185
and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other,
当我们开心并健康的时候，我们会与其他人建立一种依赖关系

132
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.839
but if you can't do that,
但是如果你做不到这一点

133
00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:25.663
because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life,
由于生活的创伤和隔离

134
00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:28.986
you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.
你会依赖其他给你安慰的东西

135
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.582
Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography,
这可能是赌博，可能是色情

136
00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.758
that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis,
可能是可卡因，可能是大麻

137
00:06:33.782 --> 00:06:37.412
but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature.
但你会依赖一些事物，那是我们的天性

138
00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:40.152
That's what we want as human beings.
这是作为人类，我们所需要的

139
00:06:40.176 --> 00:06:43.664
And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around,
开始的时候，我很难想通这件事

140
00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:46.119
but one way that helped me to think about it is,
但一个让我理解这件事的方法是

141
00:06:46.143 --> 00:06:49.532
I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right?
我能看见，我座位上有一杯水，对吧

142
00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:53.080
I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you.
我看见很多人都有一杯水

143
00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:54.919
Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.
忘了毒品，忘了毒品战争

144
00:06:54.943 --> 00:06:59.586
Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?
假设一种合法的情况，这些杯子里装的可能是伏特加，对吧?

145
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.296
We could all be getting drunk -- I might after this -- (Laughter) --
我们都可能会喝醉，节目结束了我可能就会去（笑声）

146
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.472
but we're not.
但我们没有

147
00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:07.973
Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds
但由于你们能负担得起很贵的TED门票

148
00:07:07.997 --> 00:07:13.756
that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months.
我猜你们能够付得起喝6个月的伏特加

149
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.727
You wouldn't end up homeless.
你不会因此无家可归

150
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:19.352
You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that
你不会这么做，这样的原因

151
00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:21.255
is not because anyone's stopping you.
不是因为有人阻止你

152
00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.472
It's because you've got bonds and connections
这是因为你有着依赖和联系

153
00:07:23.496 --> 00:07:25.020
that you want to be present for.
那些你不希望错过的东西

154
00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:27.413
You've got work you love. You've got people you love.
你有你热爱的工作，有你喜欢的人

155
00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:29.566
You've got healthy relationships.
你有着健康的人际关系

156
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.236
And a core part of addiction,
而上瘾的核心

157
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.737
I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests,
我认为，也是我坚信证据显示的

158
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:38.575
is about not being able to bear to be present in your life.
是对于现实生活的无奈

159
00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.938
Now, this has really significant implications.
这对我们有着深远的启发

160
00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:44.096
The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs.
在对毒品的斗争中最为明显

161
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.656
In Arizona, I went out with a group of women
在亚利桑那，我与一个女性团体出游

162
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.514
who were made to wear t-shirts saying, "I was a drug addict,"
她们被要求穿着T恤，写着“我是瘾君子”

163
00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:56.291
and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them,
排着队，被链子拴着，挖坟墓。而人们都取笑她们

164
00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:59.991
and when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records
当这些女性从监狱出来，她们会有犯罪记录

165
00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:02.635
that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again.
这意味着她们再也不能从事合法经济活动

166
00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:06.356
Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang,
当然，被铁链拴在一起使得这个例子有点极端

167
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.446
but actually almost everywhere in the world
但事实上，几乎在世界的任何一个角落

168
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.470
we treat addicts to some degree like that.
我们对瘾君子多少都是这样的

169
00:08:10.494 --> 00:08:13.352
We punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records.
我们惩罚他们，污辱他们，给他们犯罪记录

170
00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:16.111
We put barriers between them reconnecting.
我们在他们重新与外界建立联系时施加阻碍

171
00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:19.114
There was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,
加拿大有一个教授，贾博.马特

172
00:08:19.138 --> 00:08:23.009
who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse,
他告诉我，如果你想要建立一个系统让上瘾变得更糕

173
00:08:22.574 --> 00:08:24.230
you would design that system.
你就应该建议一个这样的系统

174
00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:27.520
Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite,
而有一个地方决定建立一个完全相反的系统

175
00:08:27.544 --> 00:08:29.377
and I went there to see how it worked.
我去那边看了下那是否有用

176
00:08:29.401 --> 00:08:32.796
In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe.
在2000年的时候，葡萄牙有着欧洲最严重的毒品问题

177
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.795
One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,
百分之一的人海洛因上瘾，令人震惊

178
00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:39.587
and every year, they tried the American way more and more.
每年他们都尝试使用更加强硬的美国的方法

179
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:42.564
They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more,
他们不断惩罚瘾君子，诬蔑并羞辱他们

180
00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.407
and every year, the problem got worse.
但是每年这个问题都变得更加严重

181
00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:48.142
And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together,
有一天，首相和反对党领袖坐在一起

182
00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:49.519
and basically said, look, we can't go on
大概是说，我们再也不能这样继续下去了

183
00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.513
with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts.
那样全国会有越来越多的人海洛因上瘾

184
00:08:51.513 --> 00:08:53.605
Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors
我们来建立一个由科学家和医生组成的小组

185
00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:56.836
to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.
想一个能真正解决这个问题的办法

186
00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:59.559
And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,
他们建立了一个由约翰·华谷劳博士领导的小组

187
00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:03.310
to look at all this new evidence,
审视所有的新证据

188
00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:04.061
and they came back and they said,
最后他们说

189
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.226
"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but" --
“将毒品合法化，不论是大麻还是毒品，但是

190
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.520
and this is the crucial next step --
最重要的一点

191
00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:15.165
"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off,
撤回我们过去用来对付毒瘾的费用

192
00:09:14.572 --> 00:09:16.610
on disconnecting them,
撤回我们用来隔离瘾君子的费用

193
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.250
and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society."
用这些钱来帮助他们回到社会”

194
00:09:20.274 --> 00:09:24.846
And that's not really what we think of as drug treatment
这并不是我们认为的解决毒瘾的方法

195
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.728
in the United States and Britain.
不论是在美国还是英国

196
00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:28.333
So they do do residential rehab,
他们也确实在家里做康复治疗

197
00:09:28.357 --> 00:09:31.165
they do psychological therapy, that does have some value.
他们也做心理指导，这有些帮助

198
00:09:31.189 --> 00:09:34.572
But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do:
但最重要的事情与我们过去做的完全不同

199
00:09:33.762 --> 00:09:37.114
a massive program of job creation for addicts,
就是为瘾君子创立大量就业机会

200
00:09:37.114 --> 00:09:39.710
and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses.
提供微型贷款以帮助他们做小本生意

201
00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:41.375
So say you used to be a mechanic.
假设你过去曾是一个机械工人

202
00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:44.196
When you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say,
当你准备好了后，他们会去你工作的车库，说

203
00:09:43.378 --> 00:09:46.572
if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages.
如果你们雇佣这个人满一年，我们会付他一半的薪水

204
00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:49.088
The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal
这个方法是为了确保葡萄牙的每一个瘾君子

205
00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:52.269
had something to get out of bed for in the morning.
在早上起床之后都有一些事情可做

206
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.338
And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal,
当我在葡萄牙去探访那些瘾君子时

207
00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:56.360
what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose,
他们说的是，由于他们重新找到了目标，

208
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.545
they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society.
他们重新找到了与外界社会的依赖和关系

209
00:10:00.895 --> 00:10:03.515
It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began,
今年是这个实验开始的第15个年头

210
00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:05.182
and the results are in:
结果是

211
00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:07.064
injecting drug use is down in Portugal,
注射毒品在葡萄牙的使用量降低了，

212
00:10:07.088 --> 00:10:09.679
according to the British Journal of Criminology,
根据英国犯罪学杂志的统计

213
00:10:09.703 --> 00:10:12.266
by 50 percent, five-zero percent.
50%，也就是一半

214
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.966
Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts.
过量服用毒品的案例大量减少，毒品导致的艾滋病毒传播减少

215
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.341
Addiction in every study is significantly down.
在每个研究中上瘾指标都大量下降

216
00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:22.204
One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal
一个比较令人信服的说明这很有用的事实就是

217
00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:23.933
wants to go back to the old system.
在葡萄要几乎没有人想要回到原来的系统里去

218
00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:25.797
Now, that's the political implications.
这是一个政治上的影响

219
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:28.820
I actually think there's a layer of implications
事实上，我开始思考又一个层面的影响

220
00:10:28.844 --> 00:10:30.480
to all this research below that.
所有的研究都会受之影响

221
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:33.766
We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable
我们生活在这样一种文化之中，人们对各种上瘾源

222
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.746
to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones
越来越脆弱，不管是智能手机

223
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.104
or to shopping or to eating.
还是购物或者饮食

224
00:10:38.128 --> 00:10:40.435
Before these talks began -- you guys know this --
在这个演讲开始之前，你们知道

225
00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:43.299
we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on,
我们被告知关掉智能手机

226
00:10:43.323 --> 00:10:45.944
and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like
我得说，你们中的许多人看看起来很失落

227
00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:48.953
addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable
就好像瘾君子被告知在接下来的几个小时

228
00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:50.882
for the next couple of hours. (Laughter)
都不能见到毒贩了一样（笑声）

229
00:10:50.906 --> 00:10:53.753
A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say,
许多的人觉得，听起来可能有点怪

230
00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:57.170
I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction
我一直在谈与外界的失联是导致上瘾的主要因素

231
00:10:56.994 --> 00:10:58.429
and weird to say it's growing,
非常奇怪的是这种现象正在增长

232
00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:02.219
because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely.
因为我们都以为自己正处于联系最紧密的社会

233
00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:05.100
But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have
但我逐渐开始思考，我们拥有的这种联系

234
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.300
or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection.
或我们以为的联系，就像是对人际关系的一种拙劣的模仿

235
00:11:08.324 --> 00:11:11.161
If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something.
如果你在生活中遭遇了危机，你总会注意到一些事情

236
00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:14.095
It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you.
你推特上的粉丝不会坐在你身边

237
00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:16.977
It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round.
你脸书上的伙伴不会帮你走出困境

238
00:11:16.888 --> 00:11:20.033
It'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced
只有你血肉相连的朋友，那些与你关系很深，细致入微

239
00:11:20.168 --> 00:11:22.410
and textured, face-to-face relationships with,
那些与你有着藕断丝连，面对面关系的朋友才会来帮你

240
00:11:22.434 --> 00:11:26.969
and there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,
我从环境作家比尔·麦克哪里了解到的一个研究

241
00:11:26.993 --> 00:11:29.176
that I think tells us a lot about this.
告诉了我们很多相关的道理

242
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.574
It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes
这个研究调查了美国人平均拥有的在危急时可以

243
00:11:32.598 --> 00:11:34.525
they can call on in a crisis.
电话求助的亲密朋友的数量

244
00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:37.543
That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s.
这个数量自从1950年就开始下降

245
00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:40.417
The amount of floor space an individual has in their home
而每个人在家里的空间

246
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:42.484
has been steadily increasing,
却一直稳定地增长

247
00:11:42.508 --> 00:11:44.388
and I think that's like a metaphor
我认为这更像一个隐喻

248
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.270
for the choice we've made as a culture.
就是做选择的文化

249
00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:51.145
We've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections,
我们拿朋友交换房屋面积，拿联系交换物品

250
00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:54.766
and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been.
结果就是我们成为了最孤独的社会中人

251
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.957
And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says,
那个做了老鼠公园实验的布鲁斯·亚历山大说

252
00:11:57.981 --> 00:12:01.528
we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery,
我们一直在讨论个人层面的上瘾恢复

253
00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:03.455
and it's right to talk about that,
这是正确的

254
00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:06.010
but we need to talk much more about social recovery.
但我们更应该讨论社会层面上的恢复

255
00:12:06.034 --> 00:12:09.663
Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group,
我们出问题了，不仅仅是个人，更是整个集体

256
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:12.096
and we've created a society where, for a lot of us,
我们创造了一个社会，对于许多人来说

257
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.581
life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage
生活就像一个孤立的笼子

258
00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:16.652
and a whole lot less like Rat Park.
远远不如老鼠公园

259
00:12:16.676 --> 00:12:19.708
If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it.
诚实地说，这并不是我深入调查这些的原因

260
00:12:19.732 --> 00:12:23.038
I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff.
我当时并未想去探索这些政治和社会相关的问题

261
00:12:23.062 --> 00:12:25.401
I wanted to know how to help the people I love.
我只想知道如何去帮助那些我爱的人

262
00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:28.664
And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this,
而当我结束了这段漫长的旅程，我却学到了这么多

263
00:12:28.688 --> 00:12:31.396
I looked at the addicts in my life,
我想着自己生命中的那些上瘾者

264
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.926
and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict,
如果你真的够坦率，会承认爱一个上瘾者很困难

265
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.808
and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room.
这里会有很多人都知道这件事情

266
00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:41.056
You are angry a lot of the time,
你常常生气

267
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.081
and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged
我认为，这个讨论如此热烈的原因之一在于

268
00:12:45.105 --> 00:12:47.905
is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right?
因为我们每一个人都在心里思考过这个问题

269
00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:50.876
Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks,
每一个都多少会看着上瘾的人想

270
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.651
I wish someone would just stop you.
我希望有人可以阻止你

271
00:12:52.675 --> 00:12:56.437
And the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives
我们被告知对待生活中上瘾者的办法，

272
00:12:56.461 --> 00:12:57.633
is typified by, I think,
一种非常典型的办法其实来自，我认为

273
00:12:57.657 --> 00:13:00.610
the reality show "Intervention," if you guys have ever seen it.
真人秀“介入”，不知你们看过没有

274
00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:03.308
I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV,
我认为生活中任何事都能在真人秀中反映出来

275
00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:04.276
but that's another TED Talk.
不过这是另一个Ted演讲的内容了

276
00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.989
If you've ever seen the show "Intervention,"
如果你曾经看过“介入”节目

277
00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:07.576
it's a pretty simple premise.
一个非常简单的假定：

278
00:13:07.576 --> 00:13:10.318
Get an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together,
找一个上瘾者，以及他们生活中的所有人，聚到一起

279
00:13:10.318 --> 00:13:14.077
confront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up,
就他上瘾的事情对他说，如果你不戒掉

280
00:13:14.077 --> 00:13:15.614
we're going to cut you off.
我们就疏离你

281
00:13:15.614 --> 00:13:18.416
So what they do is they take the connection to the addict,
他们所做的就是拿其与上瘾者的联系

282
00:13:18.416 --> 00:13:21.310
and they threaten it, they make it contingent
来威胁他；结果取决于

283
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.868
on the addict behaving the way they want.
上瘾者会不会按他们想的去做

284
00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:27.619
And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work,
我开始思考，意识到为什么这种方法不起作用

285
00:13:27.643 --> 00:13:32.193
and I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War
我想这就好像是引入了毒品战争中的逻辑

286
00:13:32.217 --> 00:13:34.074
into our private lives.
到我们的私人生活中来

287
00:13:34.098 --> 00:13:37.766
So I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese?
我当时想，我如何才能像葡萄牙人那么做？

288
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.295
And what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently
如今我已尝试过的，也不能说很好地坚持了

289
00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.268
and I can't tell you it's easy,
因为这一点也不简单

290
00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:45.776
is to say to the addicts in my life
是对那些在我生活中的瘾君子说

291
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.026
that I want to deepen the connection with them,
我想要加深与他们的联系

292
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.720
to say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not.
告诉他们，我爱你，不管你是否还在服毒

293
00:13:51.744 --> 00:13:54.576
I love you, whatever state you're in,
我爱你，不管你在什么阶段

294
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.991
and if you need me, I'll come and sit with you
如果你需要的话，我可以随时来到你身边

295
00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:59.615
because I love you and I don't want you to be alone
因为我爱你，不希望你独自一人

296
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.635
or to feel alone.
或是感到孤单

297
00:14:01.659 --> 00:14:03.701
And I think the core of that message --
我认为这条讯息

298
00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:06.394
you're not alone, we love you --
“你并不是孤身一人，我们爱你”的核心

299
00:14:06.418 --> 00:14:09.483
has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts,
是它必须体现在我们对待瘾君子的每一个层面上

300
00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:12.130
socially, politically and individually.
社会层面、政治层面及个人层面

301
00:14:12.154 --> 00:14:16.402
For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts.
我们向瘾君子们宣战了100年

302
00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:20.326
I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them,
我认为从一开始我们就应该对瘾君子展示关怀

303
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.598
because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety.
因为上瘾的对立面，不是清醒

304
00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:28.453
The opposite of addiction is connection.
而是联系

305
00:14:28.477 --> 00:14:30.426
Thank you.
谢谢

306
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:37.450
(Applause)
