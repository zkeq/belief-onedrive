I worked as a war reporter for 15 years

3
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.027
There was something really wrong with me.
我整个人都不对劲，

4
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.389
This was about a year before 9/11, and America wasn't at war yet.
这事大概发生在9/11事件前一年，当时美国还没处于战乱中。

5
00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:29.644
We weren't talking about PTSD.
人们尚未谈及PTSD。

6
00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:35.672
We were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche.
也未提及伤痛和战争给人带来的心灵创伤。

7
00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:38.776
I'd been in Afghanistan for a couple of months
我同北部联盟在阿富汗待过几个月，

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.808
with the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban.
正值阿富汗与塔利班交战。

9
00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:45.089
And at that point the Taliban had an air force,

10
00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:48.342
they had fighter planes, they had tanks, they had artillery,

11
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.657
and we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times.

12
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.647
We saw some very ugly things.

13
00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:56.894
But I didn't really think it affected me.

14
00:00:56.918 --> 00:00:58.446
I didn't think much about it.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.421
I came home to New York, where I live.
我返回纽约，回到居所。

16
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.326
Then one day I went down into the subway,

17
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.761

I had a massive panic attack.

20
00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:14.757
I was way more scared than I had ever been in Afghanistan.
我可比当时在阿富汗要来得惶恐得多。

21
00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:19.313
Everything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me,
眼前所见的一切似乎都想要我的命，

22
00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:21.630
but I couldn't explain why.

23
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:23.915
The trains were going too fast.

Everything was too loud, everything was moving too quickly.
万物喧闹着，飞快晃动着。

27
00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:33.280
I backed up against a support column and just waited for it.
我靠在一根支柱边，就只是静待其变。

28
00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:38.131
When I couldn't take it any longer, I ran out of the subway station
在自己忍无可忍之时，我冲出地铁站，

29
00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.994
and walked wherever I was going.
像只没头苍蝇一通瞎走。

30
00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:45.647
Later, I found out that what I had was short-term PTSD:
之后我才知晓，当时自己患上的是短期PTSD——

31
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.574
post-traumatic stress disorder.
也就是“战后孤独感症候群”。

32
00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:52.041
We evolved as animals, as primates, to survive periods of danger,
我们从动物、人猿演化而来，在危险情境中生存了下来，

33
00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:54.986
and if your life has been in danger,

34
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.651
you want to react to unfamiliar noises.

You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:05.478
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you.
你就会做噩梦并回忆起那些差点把你杀掉的事情。

37
00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:09.633
You want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight,
你会变得很生气，因为它会让你进入准备战斗的状态，

38
00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:13.090
or depressed, because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit.
或者变得绝望，因为它会让你有点喘不过气来，

39
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.742
Keeps you safe.

40
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.278
It's not very pleasant, but it's better than getting eaten.
这并不令人愉快，但比被恐惧吞噬来得好。

41
00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.743
Most people recover from that pretty quickly.

42
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.857
It takes a few weeks, a few months.

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:27.996
I kept having panic attacks, but they eventually went away.
我一直经历着这种痛苦的打击，但我最后还是康復了。

44
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.314
I had no idea it was connected to the war that I'd seen.
我不知道这和自己目睹过的战乱有所相连。

45
00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:32.290
I just thought I was going crazy,
我只觉得自己要疯了，

46
00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:35.448
and then I thought, well, now I'm not going crazy anymore.
之后我想，好吧，现在我再也不会发疯了。

47
00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:39.647
About 20 percent of people, however,
然而，大约有20%的人，

48
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:42.962
wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.

49
00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:45.380

51
00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.367
unless they get help.
除非有人能帮他们一把。

52
00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:53.353
We know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD
我们都知道那些容易转变为长期PTSD的人，

53
00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:56.093
are people who were abused as children,
这些人也许是童年时蒙受过非人虐待、

54
00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:57.848
who suffered trauma as children,
也许是年幼时遭到精神创伤、

55
00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:00.490
people who have low education levels,
也许是没有受过高等教育的人，

56
00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:03.072
people who have psychiatric disorders in their family.

57
00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:04.374
If you served in Vietnam

58
00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:07.092
and your brother is schizophrenic,

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:11.232
you're way more likely to get long-term PTSD from Vietnam.
你很有可能因越南的经历而患上PTSD。

60
00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:15.019
So I started to study this as a journalist,
因此我开始以记者的身份，来对这个问题进行调查研究，

61
00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:19.211
and I realized that there was something really strange going on.
并且意识到，确实这其中有所异常。

62
00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.978
The numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction.
“人数”似乎朝着错误的方向不断发展。

63
00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:24.789
Every war that we have fought as a country,
每一次我们国家参与的战争，

64
00:03:24.813 --> 00:03:26.787
starting with the Civil War,
——从独立战争开始，

65
00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:29.867
the intensity of the combat has gone down.
战争的强度开始下降。

66
00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:34.078
As a result, the casualty rates have gone down.
所以，伤亡率也开始下降。

67
00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:36.482
But disability rates have gone up.
但伤残率却开始上升，

68
00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:38.708
They should be going in the same direction,
它们本该是朝同一方向进发，

69
00:03:39.522 --> 00:03:41.771
but they're going in different directions.
却走上了截然不同的道路。

70
00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:48.533
The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God,
感谢上帝，最近在伊拉克和阿富汗的战争仅造成

71
00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:53.901
a casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam.
越南战争伤亡率的三分之一。

72
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.909
But they've also created --
但是，它们也导致了——

73
00:03:58.498 --> 00:04:01.844
they've also produced three times the disability rates.
多达三倍的伤残率。

74
00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:09.319
Around 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat,
将近有 10% 的美国军人经历过战场，

75
00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.597
10 percent or under.

76
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:13.895
They're shooting at people, killing people,

77
00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.257
getting shot at, seeing their friends get killed.

78
00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:17.834
It's incredibly traumatic.
这简直是莫大的精神创伤。

79
00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.668
But it's only about 10 percent of our military.
这仅仅是10%的军人。

80
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:27.171
But about half of our military has filed for some kind of PTSD compensation from the government.
然而从政府的档案中，我们看到有一半的军人正在领取 PTSD 的救济金。

81
00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:33.437
And suicide doesn't even fit into this in a very logical way.
从逻辑看来，自杀人数根本不符合这个数据。

82
00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:39.779
We've all heard the tragic statistic of 22 vets a day, on average,
我们都听说过一个不幸的统计数据，平均每天，有22个退伍军人，

83
00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:42.410
in this country, killing themselves.
就在这个国家，选择自杀。

84
00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:44.874
Most people don't realize

85
00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:50.535
that the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War,

88
00:04:56.983 --> 00:04:59.681
to the war they fought 50 years earlier.

89
00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:04.634
In fact, there's no statistical connection between combat and suicide.
实际上，目前没有战争与自杀是有关连性的统计数据。

90
00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:07.725
If you're in the military and you're in a lot of combat,
假如你在军队中参与过很多场战役，

91
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.759
you're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren't.
你更不会倾向于选择自杀，

92
00:05:11.434 --> 00:05:12.760
In fact, one study found
一项研究显示，

93
00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:14.808
that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,
假如你参与过伊拉克或者阿富汗战争，

94
00:05:14.832 --> 00:05:18.252
you're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later.
其实你是更不可能在往后选择自杀的。

95
00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:22.716
I studied anthropology in college.
我在大学时期研究人类学，

96
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.759
I did my fieldwork on the Navajo reservation.
到那瓦侯保护区做过实地调查，

97
00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:29.178
I wrote a thesis on Navajo long-distance runners.
写过当地长跑运动员的相关论文。

98
00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:34.297
And recently, while I was researching PTSD,
而最近，在我研究PTSD时，

99
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:37.426
I had this thought.
突然有了这样的想法。

100
00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:41.224
I thought back to the work I did when I was young,
我想起我年轻时做过的研究，

101
00:05:41.248 --> 00:05:45.317
and I thought, I bet the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche --
我在想，我敢说那瓦侯人，阿帕切人，科曼奇人

102
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:47.905
I mean, these are very warlike nations --
我的意思是，——這些好戰的民族——

103
00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:51.711
I bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do.
我打赌他们不像我们这样会患上PTSD。

104
00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:55.626
When their warriors came back from fighting the US military
当他们的战士从抵抗美国军队的战争中回到家乡

105
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.258
or fighting each other,
或者从部落之间的互斗中归来时，

106
00:05:58.061 --> 00:06:02.004
I bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life.
我敢说他们肯定很容易就重新融入部落生活。

107
00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:05.709
And maybe what determines
也许，

108
00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:08.427
the rate of long-term PTSD
决定长期 PTSD 的因素，

109
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.439
isn't what happened out there,
不是在战场上发生了什麽，

110
00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:14.167
but the kind of society you come back to.
而是你回到了什麽样的社会。

111
00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:19.881
And maybe if you come back to a close, cohesive, tribal society,
要是回到一个紧密联繫的、团结的、部落化的社会，

112
00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:22.968
you can get over trauma pretty quickly.
你能很快度过创伤期。

113
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.996
And if you come back to an alienating, modern society,
但假如你回到的是一个人与人疏远的现代社会，

114
00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.044
you might remain traumatized your entire life.
或许会以郁郁终生结尾。

115
00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:35.179
In other words, maybe the problem isn't them, the vets;
换句话来说，也许问题不出在他们、那些退伍军人身上；

116
00:06:35.203 --> 00:06:36.967
maybe the problem is us.
而有可能是我们社会自身的问题。

117
00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:43.588
Certainly, modern society is hard on the human psyche
的确，现代社会对人类的精神带来了重大的压力，

118
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.383
by every metric that we have.
这些压力来自于我们社会上各种的衡量标准。

119
00:06:48.863 --> 00:06:51.224
As wealth goes up in a society,
随着社会财富积累，

120
00:06:53.343 --> 00:06:56.914
the suicide rate goes up instead of down.
自杀率不减反增。

121
00:06:57.886 --> 00:06:59.976
If you live in modern society,
如果你住在现代社会中，

122
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.136
you're up to eight times more likely
有多达 8 倍的几率，

123
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.520
to suffer from depression in your lifetime
毕生遭受更多、

124
00:07:06.544 --> 00:07:09.432
than if you live in a poor, agrarian society.
比生活在贫困农耕社会，还要多的忧愁烦恼。

125
00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:14.334
Modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide
现代社会可能引发了有所以来超高的自杀率、

126
00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:19.381
and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history.
抑郁症、焦虑症、孤僻症 和受到童年虐待的可能，这比例要比历史任一时代都高。

127
00:07:20.515 --> 00:07:22.088
I saw one study
我曾看过一项研究，

128
00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:25.154
that compared women in Nigeria,
它把尼日利亚的妇女，

129
00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:30.653
one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in Africa,
也就是非洲最混乱、暴力、堕落、最贫穷的国家之一，

130
00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:32.469
to women in North America.
和北美的女性进行比较。

131
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:37.683
And the highest rates of depression were urban women in North America.
北美的城市女性是抑郁症患病率最高的。

132
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.702
That was also the wealthiest group.
她们同样是最富有的一群人。

133
00:07:40.457 --> 00:07:44.306
So let's go back to the US military.
那么，我们回头来看美军的状况。

134
00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:47.434
Ten percent are in combat.
10% 的军人经历过战争。

135
00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:52.197
Around 50 percent have filed for PTSD compensation.
约乎50%的人申请PTSD补偿金。

136
00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:58.524
So about 40 percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas
所以大概 40%的退伍老兵并不是在海外受到精神创伤，

137
00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:05.709
but have come home to discover they are dangerously alienated and depressed.
而是回到家后发现他们被孤立并感到沮丧绝望。

138
00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:11.098
So what is happening with them?
