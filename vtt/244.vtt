to cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside,

not 2,000 years ago, nor today.

And incidentally, it is still the largest

156
00:06:47.287 --> 00:06:51.101
unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.

certainly not by you.

00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:21.425
varied the density of the aggregate

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:24.193
as they worked their way up the dome.
不断改变混合物的密度而达到的。

to the design.
引人注目的强迫视图。

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.806
It was wonderfully cool inside

175
00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.989

190
00:08:14.447 --> 00:08:16.899
I also realized that I wasn't the first person
