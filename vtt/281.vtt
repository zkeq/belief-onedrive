1
00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.066
Now, I've been making pictures for quite a long time,
我从事摄影已经有很长一段时间，

2
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.458
and normally speaking, a picture like this, for me,
并且通常来说，拍这种照片对我来说

3
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.385
should be straightforward.
应该是挺简单的。

4
00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.241
I'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach.
我在埃塞俄比亚南部，和达桑内科部落的人住在一起。

5
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:25.352
There's a big family, there's a very beautiful tree,
这是一个庞大的家族，站在一颗非常美丽的树上，

6
00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:31.691
and I make these pictures with this very large, extremely cumbersome, very awkward technical plate film camera.
我用这个非常大并且极其笨重不方便的专业平板胶片相机拍了这些照片。

7
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:35.151
Does anybody know 4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,
有谁知道4x5和10x8的胶片，

8
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:38.680
and you're setting it up, putting it on the tripod.
你将相机放在三脚架上并调试好。

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.535
I've got the family, spent the better part of a day talking with them.
我花了一天大部分的时间来说服了他们。

10
00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:44.551
They sort of understand what I'm on about.
他们大概了解了我正在做的事。

11
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.059
They think I'm a bit crazy, but that's another story.
他们认为我有点疯狂，但那又是另一个故事。

12
00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.429
And what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic,
美对我是最重要的，

13
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.681
and that's based on the light.
并且那取决于光线。

14
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:55.282
So the light's setting on my left-hand side,
所以我的左手边是灯光设置，

15
00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:58.916
and there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach,
还要与达桑内科人保持交流，

16
00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:00.460
the family of 30, all ages.
一个有30人，包含了所有年龄层的家庭。

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.397
There's babies and there's grandparents,

18
00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:05.363
I'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set,
我将他们安排在树上，等着光线，

19
00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:08.452
and it's going, going, and I've got one sheet of film left,
拍了一张又一张，然后我就剩下一张胶片了，

20
00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.993
and I think, I'm okay, I'm in control, I'm in control.
我对自己说没事，一切在掌控之中，一切在掌控之中，

21
00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:14.565
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up, and the light's just about to go,
我调了又调，调了又调，但光线就是差一点

22
00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:17.246
and I want it to be golden, I want it to be beautiful.
我希望那是金色的，我希望拍出来是美丽的。

23
00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:20.292
I want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people,
我希望那道光线刚刚好在地平线上，这样它就能照亮所有人

24
00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.922
in all the potential glory that they could be presented.
使他们能散发出所有隐藏的光辉。

25
00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:24.971
And it's about to go  and it's about to go,
就快好了，就快好了，

26
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:26.596
and I put my sheet in the camera,
我把胶卷放到相机里，

27
00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:27.448
it's all focused,
也调好焦了，

28
00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:29.733
and all of a sudden there's a massive "whack,"
突然，一声巨响，

29
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.507
and I'm looking around, and in the top corner of the tree,
我看了看，发现在树的顶端

30
00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:34.586
one of the girls slaps the girl next to her,
其中一个女孩打了她旁边的女孩一下，

31
00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:38.376
and the girl next to her pulls her hair, and all hell breaks loose,
被打的女孩扯住打人女孩的头发，一切都开始失控，

32
00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:41.110
and I'm standing there going, "But the light, the light.
我站在那喊道：”我需要光，光，

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.400
Wait, I need the light. Stay still! Stay still!"
再等一会儿，我需要光，别动！别动！”

34
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.600
And they start screaming,
他们开始喊叫，

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.784
and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming, shouting,
然后其中一个男人转过身开始咆哮，

36
00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:51.217
and the whole tree collapses, not the tree, but the people in the tree.
整棵树倒了，其实不是树，是树上的人。

37
00:01:51.217 --> 00:01:54.837
They're all running around screaming, and they run back off into the village
他们都一边叫一边跑回了庄子，

38
00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:58.619
in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm left there standing behind my tripod.
只留下一片尘烟，而我被留在原地，站在我的三脚架后面。

39
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.966
I've got my sheet, and the light's gone, and I can't make the picture.
我已经放好我的胶片，但是光线消失了，我拍不了照片了。

40
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.990
Where have they all gone? I had no idea.
我不知道他们去哪了。

41
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.852
It took me a week, it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today,
你们今天看到的这张照片花了我一个星期的时间，

42
00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:10.891
and I'll tell you why. (Applause)
我会告诉你们为什么的。

43
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:14.554
It's very, very, very simple -- I spent a week going around the village,
那非常非常非常的简单，我花了一个星期的时间走遍整个庄子，

44
00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:17.623
and I went to every single one: "Hello, can you meet at the tree?
我去每一户人家，问：“你好，你能回到那棵树下吗？

45
00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:19.412
What's your story? Who are you?"
能说说你的故事吗？你是谁？”

46
00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:22.657
And it all turned out to be about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.
结果发现那都跟那个喊得特别大声的男孩有关。

47
00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:24.740
I mean, I have teenage kids. I should know.
我是说，我有正处于青春期的孩子，我应该知道。

48
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.413
It was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,
那应该是关于男孩的。在树上的女孩亲错了人，

49
00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:30.051
and they'd started having a fight.
于是她们开始打架。

50
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.848
And there was a very, very beautiful lesson for me in that:
我在其中学到了一个非常非常有意义的教训：

51
00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:35.060
If I was going to photograph these people
如果我想要以我想要的尊敬的方式

52
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.604
in the dignified, respectful way that I had intended,
来拍这些人，

53
00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:40.117
and put them on a pedestal, I had to understand them.
并且让他们呆在我设置的环境中，我必须理解他们。

54
00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:43.407
It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand.
那不仅仅是出现，挥个手，

55
00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:46.462
It wasn't about just saying, "I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."
说：“我是Jimmy，我是一个摄影师。”那么简单。

56
00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:48.632
I had to get to know every single one of them,
我必须了解他们每一个人，

57
00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.905
right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who.
包括谁的男朋友是谁，谁可以亲谁。

58
00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.791
So in the end, a week later,
最后，一个星期后，

59
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.292
and I was absolutely exhausted,
我整个人累瘫了，

60
00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:58.063
I mean on my knees going, "Please get back up in that tree.
我几乎都跪下了，“请回到那棵树去。

61
00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.586
It's a picture I need to make."
我必须拍那张照片。”

62
00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:02.275
They all came back. I put them all back up in the tree.
他们都回来了，我把他们都放回到树上。

63
00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:04.585
I made sure the girls were in the right position,
我确保女孩们都在正确的位置，

64
00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.750
and the ones that slapped, one was over there.
打人的在这，另一个人在那。

65
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.308
They did look at each other. If you look at it later,
她们确实在看着对方，如果你之后再看，

66
00:03:09.308 --> 00:03:11.772
they're staring at each other very angrily,
她们就是非常生气地盯着对方，

67
00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:13.763
and I've got the tree and everything,
我已经准备好了一切，

68
00:03:13.763 --> 00:03:16.418
and then at the last minute, I go, "The goat, the goat!
然后最后一分钟，我喊道：“羊呢，羊呢！

69
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:20.127
I need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle."
我需要某样东西让大家都盯着，我需要一只白色山羊。”

70
00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:22.716
So I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in.
所以我唤来了所有的山羊，我把山羊放进去。

71
00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:26.327
But even then I got it wrong, because if you can see on the left-hand side,
但我仍然搞砸了，因为如果你能看到照片里的左边，

72
00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:29.414
another little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat.
又一个小男孩愤然离去，因为我没有选他的羊。

73
00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:32.768
So the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.
所以除了达桑内科语外，我还必须学会山羊话。

74
00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:35.281
But anyway, the effort that goes into that picture
但是无论如何，通过为那张照片所花费的努力

75
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.375
and the story that I've just related to you,
和我刚刚告诉你们的故事，

76
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:38.383
as you can imagine,
你可以想象，

77
00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:43.061
there are hundreds of other bizarre, eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world.
世界上还有无数的关于其他人的不同寻常的故事。

78
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.543
And this was about four years ago, and I set off on a journey,
这大概是七年前拍的，然后我又踏上了新的旅程，

79
00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:48.564
to be honest, a very indulgent journey.
说实话，一个非常疯狂的旅行。

80
00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:53.779
I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist, perhaps in some ways naive.
我是一个真正的浪漫主义者，一个理想主义者，可能我有点幼稚。

81
00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.572
But I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful.
但是我真的相信在这个世界上存在着美丽的人。

82
00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:00.320
It's very, very simple. It's not rocket science.
那其实很简单，一点也不高深。

83
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.332
I wanted to put these people on a pedestal.
我想要把这些人都聚在一起，

84
00:04:02.332 --> 00:04:05.815
I wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before.
把他们放在从未被注视的盘子上。

85
00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:09.842
So, I chose about 35 different groups,
所以我选择了大概35个不同的群体，

86
00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:11.721
tribes, indigenous cultures.
部落，当地人。

87
00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:14.337
They were chosen purely because of their aesthetic,
他们被选中仅仅是因为他们的美，

88
00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.194
and I'll talk more about that later.
我会在之后谈及到这一点。

89
00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:19.770
I'm not an anthropologist, I have no technical study with the subject,
我不是一个人类学家，在这方面没有什么专业的研究，

90
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.672
but I do have a very, very, very deep passion,
但是我有无比强烈的激情，

91
00:04:22.672 --> 00:04:26.144
and I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet

92
00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.730
in the most beautiful environment that they lived in,

93
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.035
and put the two together and present them to you.
放在一起，并展现给你们看。

94
00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.109
About a year ago,
大概一年前，

95
00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.222
I published the first pictures,
我公布了我的第一张照片，

96
00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:39.239
and something extraordinarily exciting happened.
令人非常兴奋的事发生了。

97
00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.793
The whole world came running,
整个世界都跑过来问我，

98
00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:44.118
and it was a bizarre experience, because everybody, from everywhere:
那真的是一个非同寻常的经历，因为各个地方的人都来问我：

99
00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:46.449
"Who are they? What are they? How many are they?
“他们是谁？都是干什么的？有多少人？

100
00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.009
Where did you find them? Are they real? You faked it.
你在哪儿发现他们的？这是你伪造的吧。

101
00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.439
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me." Millions of questions for which,
告诉我，告诉我，告诉我，告诉我。” 大量的问题涌向我，

102
00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.563
to be honest, I don't have the answers.
然而，说实话，我并不知道答案。

103
00:04:54.563 --> 00:04:56.243
I really didn't have the answers,
我真得不知道答案，

104
00:04:56.243 --> 00:05:00.066
and I could sort of understand, okay, they're beautiful, that was my intention,
好吧，我知道他们是美丽的，当然那也是我的目的，

105
00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.133
but the questions that I was being fired at,

106
00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:04.176
I could not answer them.

107
00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:07.009
Until, it was quite amusing, about a year ago
现在，那也依然很有趣，大概一年前

108
00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.660
somebody said, "You've been invited to do a TED Talk."
有人对我说：“你被邀请去做 TED 演讲。”

109

我问：“Ted？Ted？谁是Ted？我从来没见过Ted。”

110
00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:15.841

他说：“不是的，是一个 TED 演讲。” 我问：“但是到底谁是Ted？

111
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:19.163
Do I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage?"
我一定要和他说话或者是坐在一个舞台上？“

112
00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:22.300
And, "No, no, the TED group. You must know about it."
他说”不不不，是一个名叫TED的团队，你一定知道它的。”

113
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.915
And I said, "I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years.
于是我说：“我之前的五年都和印第安人、蒙古人待在一起，

114
00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:28.248
How do I know who Ted is? Introduce me to him."
我怎么可能知道谁是Ted？

115
00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:31.587
Anyway, to cut a long story short, he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."
介绍我们俩认识认识。”

116
00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:33.486
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!
了解后我非常的激动。太棒了！

117
00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:37.094
And then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal. Even more exciting.
更令人激动的是，我被邀请参加全球 TED 大会。

118
00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:40.118
But what you need to do, you need to teach the people lessons,
但是我需要教给人们一些

119
00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:43.170
lessons that you've learned on your travels around the world
从我的环球旅行中

120
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.100
with these tribes.
从这些部落中学到的经验教训。

121
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.400
I thought, lessons, okay, well, what did I learn? Good question.
我想了想我学到的经验教训，这的确是个好问题。

122
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.706
Three. You need three lessons, and they need to be terribly profound.
我需要有三个，这三个一定要有特别深远的影响。

123
00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:52.624
(Laughter)
（笑声）

124
00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:55.767
And I thought, three lessons, well, I'm going to think about it.
好吧，三个教训，我必须得好好想一想了。

125
00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:59.913
(Applause)
（鼓掌声）

126
00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:04.360
So I thought long and hard, and I stood here two days ago,

and I had my test run, and I had my cards

128

and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen,
手中的遥控器没问题，照片显示在屏幕上，

129
00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.989
and I had my three lessons, and I started presenting them,

130
00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:14.383
and I had this very odd out-of-body experience.
我有了这次神奇的超乎想象的经历。

131
00:06:14.383 --> 00:06:17.237
I sort of looked at myself standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,
我看着自己站在台上，想到：“噢，Jimmy，

132
00:06:17.237 --> 00:06:19.053
this is complete loads of codswallop.
你这完全就是啰啰嗦嗦的废话。

133
00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:22.237
All these people sitting here, they've had more of these talks,
坐在这里的所有人都听过很多演讲，

134
00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.241
they've heard more lessons in their life.
他们早就听够了这些什么经验教训的。

135
00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:26.393
Who are you to tell them what you've learned?
你凭什么跟他们说你自己的经验教训？

136
00:06:26.393 --> 00:06:29.036
Who are you to guide them and who are you to show them
你凭什么教育他们，

137
00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:31.991
what is right, what is wrong, what these people have to say?"
凭什么由你来告诉他们是非问题，这些人是怎么想的？”

138
00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.272
And I had a little bit of a, it was very private,
我有一点，呃，那是挺私人的，

139
00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:35.590
a little bit of a meltdown.
就是有点崩溃。

140
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.727
I went back, and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats,
我非常不开心地回去了，

141
00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:42.978
very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,
就像是那个小男孩和他的羊离开那棵树时一样。想着，根本没用。

142
00:06:42.978 --> 00:06:45.253
It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.
那些都不是我想说的。

143
00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:48.855
And I thought long and hard about it, and I thought, well, the only thing
我努力思考了很久，

144
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:50.708
I can communicate is very, very basic.
想到，好吧，我能说的是非常非常基本的。

145
00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:52.595
You have to turn it all the way around.
我必须得换一种方式想一想。

146
00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:55.973
There's only one person I know here, and that's me.
这里我只知道一个人，就是我自己。

147
00:06:55.973 --> 00:06:57.715
I'm still getting to know myself,
我仍在继续发现我自己，了解我自己，

148
00:06:57.715 --> 00:07:01.150
and it's a lifelong journey, and I probably won't have all the answers,
而那要花费我一生的时间，即使这样，我也可能不能完全了解自己，

149
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.260
but I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey.
但是我在这个旅途中真的学到了一些意想不到的东西。

150
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.417
So what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons.
所以我将会把我的经验分享给你们。

151
00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:12.143
It's a very, as I explained at the beginning, very indulgent, very personal,
我在演讲的开始就提到过，这是一场非常疯狂且个人的旅行，

152
00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:14.474
how and why I made these pictures,
我拍这些照片的原因和方法

153
00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:17.709
and I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons
我会由你们自己从观众的角度来理解

154
00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:21.357
have meant to me, what they could perhaps mean to you.
这些教训对我的意义和他们对你们可能存在的意义。

155
00:07:22.197 --> 00:07:24.912
I traveled enormously as a child.
我孩童时到处旅游，

156
00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:27.433
I was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting.
我流浪着，但是那确实很刺激。

157
00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:29.244
All around the world,
环游世界，

158
00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:33.120
and I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed
让我有一种急速成长的感觉，

159
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.583
to become somebody, become that individual, Jimmy.
让我逐渐成为真正的自己，真正的 Jimmy。

160
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:37.981
Go off into the planet, and so I ran, and I ran,
回到地球上，我一直在不停地跑啊跑，

161
00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:41.491
and my wife sometimes kids me, "Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"
我的妻子有时会开玩笑说：“Jimmy，你有点像阿甘。”

162
00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:43.828
but I'm, "No, it's all about something, trust me."
我回答说：“不，我有我的目的，相信我。”

163
00:07:43.828 --> 00:07:46.991
So I kept running and I kept running, and I sort of got somewhere
所以我继续跑啊跑，跑啊跑，然后我来到一个地方，

164
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:50.162
and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought, well,
我站在那，环顾四周，然后想：

165
00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:52.021
where do I belong? Where do I fit?
我来自何方？我情归何处？

166
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:55.333
What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.
我又到底是谁？我不知道。

167
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:58.410
So I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience.
所以我希望观众席里不要有太多的心理学家。

168
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.800
Perhaps part of this journey
这场旅行可能

169
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.923
is about me trying to find out where I belonged.
就是让我去找到我真正该去的地方。

170
00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:07.020
So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't when I arrived with these tribes,
所以当我走了，不用担心，我即使与这些部落呆在一起，

171
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.794
I didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths.
也不会将自己全身涂满黄色，拿着矛围着遮羞布到处跑。

172
00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:13.720
But what I did find were people that belonged themselves,
我真正发现的是那些完全属于他们自己的人，

173
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.390
and they inspired me, some extraordinary people,
那些令我意想不到的人激励了我，

174
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.200
and I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine.
我想将我的一些英雄介绍给你们。

175
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.092
They're the Huli.
他们是胡力族。

176
00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:26.479
Now, the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people on the planet.
目前，胡力族是这颗星球上最美丽的民族之一。

177
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.451
They're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands.
他们是骄傲的。他们生活在巴布亚新几内亚高原地带。

178
00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:33.550
There's not many of them left, and they're called the Huli wigmen.
他们被叫做胡力温格部落，已经人数不多。

179
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.628
And images like this, I mean, this is what it's all about for me.
想象一下，这就是我的所有事。

180
00:08:36.628 --> 00:08:40.118
And you've spent weeks and months there talking with them, getting there,
你通过好几个星期，用几个月的时间和他们交流，融入他们之中，

181
00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:43.367
and I want to put them on a pedestal, and I said, "You have something
我想把他们放在一个平台上，于是我说：

182
00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:44.900
that many people have not seen.
”你们身上有一些东西是许多人都没有见过的。

183
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.555
You sit in this stunning nature."
你们坐在这令人惊奇的自然中。“

184
00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:49.836
And it really does look like this, and they really do look like this.
它的确是这么回事，他们真的就是这样。

185
00:08:49.836 --> 00:08:51.037
This is the real thing.
这些都是真的。

186
00:08:51.037 --> 00:08:54.091
And you know why they're proud? You know why they look like this,
你们知道他们为什么会感到骄傲，

187
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:55.884
and why I broke my back literally
为什么是这种样子，

188
00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:58.058
to photograph them and present them to you?
为什么再辛苦我也要将他们拍下来给你们看吗？

189
00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:00.560
It's because they have these extraordinary rituals.
因为他们拥有这些不同寻常的风俗习惯。

190
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.083
And the Huli have this ritual: When they're teenagers,
胡力族有这些传统：当他们还是青少年时，

191
00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:05.960
becoming a man, they have to shave their heads,
成人礼上，他们必须剃头，

192
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.082
and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day,
之后他们每一天都要剃头，

193
00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.046
and what they do with that hair,
他们会将这些头发

194
00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.950
they make it into a creation,
做成一件艺术品，

195
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.946
a creation that's a very personal creation.
一件非常私人的艺术品。

196
00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:18.199
It's their creation. It's their Huli creation.
这是他们的艺术品，只属于胡力族的艺术品。

197
00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:20.242
So they're called the Huli wigmen.
这也是他们被叫做胡力温格族的原因。

198
00:09:20.242 --> 00:09:22.099
That's a wig on his head.
他们的头上都有顶假发，

199
00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:23.855
It's all made out of his human hair.
一顶完全由他们自己头发做成的假发。

200
00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:27.393
And then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise,
他们会用天堂鸟的羽毛来装饰它，

201
00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.641
and don't worry, there are many birds there.
不用担心，那里有许多天堂鸟。

202
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.853
There's very few people living, so nothing to get too upset about,
很少有人住在那里，所以不用担心，

203
00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:35.760
and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats
他们会花一生的时间来重新创造这些帽子，

204
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.314
and getting further and further,
使它变得更完善，更美，

205
00:09:37.314 --> 00:09:39.718
and it's extraordinary, and there's another group,
这非常的奇妙，还有另一个部落，

206
00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:42.750
they're called the Kalam, and they live in the next valley,
他们是叫 Kalang 的部落，就住在旁边的村子，

207
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.968
but they speak a completely different language,
但是他们的语言完全不同，

208
00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:47.440
they look completely different, and they wear a hat,
和胡力族外貌上也完全不一样，不过他们也戴帽子，

209
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.037
and it's built out of scarabs,
用绿宝石色的金龟子

210
00:09:49.037 --> 00:09:51.350
these fantastic emerald green little scarabs,
做成的帽子，

211
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.457
and sometimes there are 5,000 or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,
有时一顶帽子上会有5000到6000的金龟子，

212
00:09:54.457 --> 00:09:58.518
and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats.
他们会花费一生的时间来收集这些金龟子来做这些帽子。

213
00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:02.442
So the Huli inspired me in that they belong.
胡力启发了我对归属的认识。

214
00:10:02.442 --> 00:10:06.018
Perhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me
或许我必须得努力工作来找到一个对我很重要的习俗，

215
00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:10.499
and going back into my past to see where I actually fit.
还要回顾过去，去找到我真正适合的地方。

216
00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:13.169
An extremely important part of this project
这个项目里最重要的一部分是

217
00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:19.090
was about how I photograph these extraordinary people.
我要如何拍下这些令人惊奇的人们。

218
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.480
And it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters.
他们都是美的，美当然是很重要的。

219
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.940
We spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty:
我们的存在几乎就是围绕着美：

220
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.608
beautiful places, beautiful things, and ultimately, beautiful people.
美妙的地方，美好的东西，最后，美丽的人。

221
00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:31.628
It's very, very, very significant.
这非常非常明显。

222
00:10:31.628 --> 00:10:34.415
I've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like?
我已经花了我的一生来分析我长什么样？

223
00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:36.152
Am I perceived as beautiful?
我被人们认为美吗？

224
00:10:36.152 --> 00:10:38.525
Does it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not,
我的美与不美真的很重要吗？

225
00:10:38.525 --> 00:10:40.498
or is it purely based on my aesthetic?
或者这只是建立在我的审美上？

226
00:10:40.498 --> 00:10:43.424
And then when I went off, I came to a very narrow conclusion.
我想了想，得出一个非常狭隘的结论。

227
00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:46.976
Do I have to go around the world photographing, excuse me,
我一定要去拍世界上年龄25到30的女人吗？

228
00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:50.774
women between the age of 25 and 30? Is that what beauty is going to be?
那就是美应该有的样子吗？

229
00:10:50.774 --> 00:10:54.229
Is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant?
难道不在这个年龄范围内的就不美吗？

230
00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:56.473
And it was only until I went on a journey,
直到我去旅行了，我才得到真正的答案。

231
00:10:56.473 --> 00:10:59.260
a journey that was so extreme,
那趟旅行特别的极端，

232
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.868
I still get shivers when I think about it.
我现在仍会因想到它而激动地颤抖。

233
00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:05.017
I went to a part of the world, and I don't know whether any of you
我去了世界的一个角落，

234
00:11:05.017 --> 00:11:08.222
have ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?
我不知道你们有谁有听过楚科奇半岛的。有人听过吗？

235
00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:12.749
Chukotka probably is, technically, as far as one can go
严格来说，楚科奇半岛可能是

236
00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:16.511
and still be on the living planet.
你在这个星球上能去到的最远的地方。

237
00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:18.577
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.
从莫斯科出发要飞行13个小时才能到达。

238
00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:22.425
First you've got to get to Moscow, and then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.
首先你到达莫斯科，然后就是13小时的直达飞机。

239
00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:25.146
And that's if you get there.
当你到达那，

240
00:11:25.146 --> 00:11:27.671
As you can see, some people sort of miss the runway.
有些人会开始有点想念飞机跑道了。

241
00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:30.680
And then when you land there, in Chukotka are the Chukchis.
住在楚科奇半岛上的人就是楚科奇人了。

242
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.971
Now, the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia,
目前，楚科奇人是西伯利亚最后一支土生土长的因纽特人，

243
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:37.164
and they're people I'd heard about, I'd hardly seen any images of,
我听过他们，但从没见过他们的任何照片，

244
00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:38.560
but I knew they were there,
但是我知道他们就在那，

245
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.554
and I'd been in touch with this guide,
所以我和导游取得联系，

246
00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:41.593
and this guide said,
这个导游说：

247
00:11:41.593 --> 00:11:44.630
"There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about 40 of them.
“这是一个奇妙的部落。只有40个人。

248
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.820
You'll be okay. We'll find them." So off we went on this journey.
你可以放心，我们会找到他们的。”于是我们便开始了这场旅行。

249
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.882
When we arrived there, after a month of traveling across the ice,
经过一个月的穿越冰川，我们到达了楚科奇人所在的地方，

250
00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:54.206
and we'd got to them, but then I was not allowed to photograph them.
我们与他们进行接触，但是卻不能拍他們。

251
00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:56.775
They said, "You cannot photograph us. You have to wait.
他们说：“你现在不能拍我们。你必须等。

252
00:11:56.775 --> 00:12:00.958
You have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us.
你必须等到你开始了解我们，开始理解我们，

253
00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.084
You have to wait until you see how we interact with one another."
明白我们是如何与他人交流的。”

254
00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:07.022
And only then, it was many, many weeks later, I saw a respect.
知道过了好几个星期，我看到了一种尊重。

255
00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:08.556
They had zero judgment.
他们有從不批判彼此。

256
00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:12.154
They observed one another, from the youth, from the middle aged to the old.
他们看着另一个人，从幼年，中年，直到老年。

257
00:12:12.154 --> 00:12:14.420
They need each other.
他们需要彼此。

258
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.450
The children need to chew the meat all day
孩子们要嚼一整天的肉

259
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.599
because the adults don't have any teeth,
因为大人们没有牙齿，

260
00:12:18.599 --> 00:12:21.557
but at the same time, the children take the old aged people out
同时，孩子们还要

261
00:12:21.557 --> 00:12:23.527
to the toilet because they're infirm,

262

so there's this fantastic community of respect.
所以他们形成了一种具有尊敬品质的美妙团体。

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:36.881
Now I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction.

This is extremely important for the end of my talk.

If you could look at somebody left to the right of you,

268
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:44.053
and I want you to observe them,

and I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important.

271
00:12:51.254 --> 00:12:54.297
but please look at each other, give them a compliment.

And you have to remember it.

276
00:13:09.366 --> 00:13:13.800
And the last thing, it was extraordinarily profound,
最后这件事，它有着特别深远的意义，

277
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.479
and it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.
并且就在两个星期前。两个星期前我回到了辛巴族。

278
00:13:17.479 --> 00:13:20.583
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola,
辛巴族住在安哥拉边界的纳米比亚南部，

279
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:22.510
and I'd been there a few times before,
我之前去过几次，

280
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.859
and I'd gone back to present this book I'd made,
我回去是为了将我的书送给他们，

281
00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:27.780
to show them the pictures, to get into a discussion with them,
给他们看看照片，和他们讨论，

282
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.650
to say, "This is how I saw you. This is how I love you.
跟他们说：“这就是我如何看你们，如何爱你们，如何尊敬你们。

283
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.963
This is how I respect you. What do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"
你们怎么看？我做对了吗？”

284
00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:37.036
So I wanted this debate. It was very, very, very emotional,
我想要这次讨论。它非常非常非常地感性，

285
00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:39.477
and one night we were sitting around the campfire,
一年晚上我们围着篝火坐在一起，

286
00:13:39.477 --> 00:13:43.099
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink,
我必须承认，我有点喝多了，

287
00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:46.646
and I was sort of sitting under the stars going, "This is great,
我就坐在星星下，说：

288
00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:49.270
you've seen my pictures, we love each other." (Laughter)
“这太棒了，你们看了我的照片，我们爱着彼此。”

289
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.412
And I'm a little bit slow,
我变得有点迟钝，

290
00:13:52.412 --> 00:13:54.323
and I looked around me, and I said,
我看看周围，说：

291
00:13:54.323 --> 00:13:56.625
I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.
“那个......栅栏是不是不见了。

292
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.720
Wasn't there a fence here last time I came?
我上次来的时候那里不是有个栅栏吗？”

293
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.778
You know, this big protective fence around the village,
要知道，之前有个大栅栏包围着村庄以保护村庄的安全，

294
00:14:01.778 --> 00:14:04.492
and they sort of looked at me and go, "Yeah, chief die."
他们看着我说：“是的，酋长死了。”

295
00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:06.958
And I thought, okay, chief dying, right, you know,
我想：好吧，酋长死了。

296
00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.349
look up at the stars again, look at the campfire.
我有抬头看了看星星，看了看篝火，

297
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.219
Chief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence?
想：酋长死了，这跟篱笆没了到底有什么关系？

298
00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:16.236
"Chief die.
“酋长死了。

299
00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:18.674
First we destroy, yeah? Then we reflect.
首先我们毁掉了篱笆，然后我们反省。

300
00:14:18.674 --> 00:14:22.528
Then we rebuild. Then we respect."
接下去又重建了，之后我们遵守，又毁掉了篱笆。”

301
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:28.310
And I burst out in tears, because my father had only just died prior to this journey,
我大哭，因为我的父亲在这个旅途之前就去世了，

302
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.981
and I didn't ever acknowledge him,

303
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.940
I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today
我还来不及感谢他

304
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.053
because of him.

305
00:14:36.053 --> 00:14:41.079
These people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents

306
00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:43.355
and our grandparents and our forefathers

307
00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:45.166
going on and on and on before that,
在这之前不断地繁衍生活着，

308
00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:49.252
and I, no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey,
而我，不管我在这旅程中我是多么的浪漫主义或是理想主义，

309
00:14:49.252 --> 00:14:51.609
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

00:14:57.339 --> 00:14:59.596
Well, there's an image I'd like to show you,
这有一张照片我想给你们看，

313
00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:03.325
quite a special image, and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose.
一个相当特别的照片，但是这张不是我一定要选择给你们看的照片。

314
00:15:03.325 --> 00:15:07.123
I was sitting there the other day, and I have to finish on a strong image.
几天前，我坐在那，必须得选择一张具有强烈意义的照片。

315
00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:10.982
And somebody said, "You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."
有人说：“你得给他们看这张关于Nanev的照片。”

316
00:15:10.982 --> 00:15:13.650
I was like, yeah, but that's not my favorite picture.
但是那张并不是我最喜欢的一张。

317

You're in his eyes."

319
00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:20.940
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes? It's a picture of the Nenets."
我说：“你说我在他的眼睛里是什么意思？这就是Nanev的照片呀。”

320
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.529

她说：“不，仔细看，靠近点看，你在他的眼睛里。”

321
00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:27.691
And when you look closely at this picture, there is a reflection of me in his eyes,
当你仔细地看这张照片，会在他的眼睛里看到我的影像，

322
00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:31.080
so I think perhaps he has my soul, and I'm in his soul,
我想也许他有着我的灵魂，我在他的灵魂里，

323
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.258

but there is something extraordinarily important about these people.

but you must do. There must be something there.
