1
00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:14.161
We are losing our listening.
[AI] 我们正在失去听力。

2
00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.240
We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening.

3
00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:20.796
but we're not very good at it.

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.327
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.

5
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.853
Now -- not you. not this talk.
[AI] 现在，不是你。不是这个话题。

6
00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:26.402
but that is generally true.
[AI] 但这通常是正确的。

7
00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:31.113
Let's define listening as making meaning from sound.
[AI] 让我们把倾听定义为从声音中产生意义。

8
00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:33.031
It's a mental process.
[AI] 这是一个心理过程。

9
00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:35.277
and it's a process of extraction.
[AI] 这是一个提取的过程。

10
00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:37.866
We use some pretty cool techniques to do this.
[AI] 我们使用一些非常酷的技术来实现这一点。

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.629
One of them is pattern recognition.
[AI] 其中之一是模式识别。

12
00:00:39.653 --> 00:00:42.005
(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail party like this.
[AI] （人群的喧闹声）在这样的鸡尾酒会上。

13

if I say. "David. Sara. pay attention" -- some of you just sat up.
[AI] 如果我说。“大卫，莎拉，注意”——你们有些人只是坐了起来。

14
00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:50.007
We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal.

15
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:51.546
and especially our name.

16
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:54.110
Differencing is another technique we use.

17
00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:57.290
If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes.
[AI] 如果我让这个粉红色的噪音持续几分钟以上。

18
00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.888
(Pink noise) you would literally cease to hear it.
[AI] （粉红色的噪音）你真的听不见了。

19
00:00:59.912 --> 00:01:03.999
We listen to differences; we discount sounds that remain the same.
[AI] 我们倾听差异；我们对保持不变的声音打折。

20
00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:07.661
And then there is a whole range of filters.

21
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:10.137
These filters take us from all sound

22
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.232
down to what we pay attention to.
[AI] 具体到我们所关注的。

23
00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:16.315
Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters.
[AI] 大多数人完全没有意识到这些过滤器。

24
00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:18.889
But they actually create our reality in a way.
[AI] 但他们实际上以某种方式创造了我们的现实。

25
00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:21.920
because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.

26
00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:23.710
I'll give you one example of that.
[AI] 我给你举个例子。

27
00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.641
Intention is very important in sound. in listening.

32
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.083
(Laughter)
[AI] （众笑）

34
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:43.589
But that's not all.

35
00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:46.196
Sound places us in space and in time.
[AI] 声音将我们置于时空之中。

36
00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.518
If you close your eyes right now in this room.

39
00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.682
you're aware of how many people are around you.

40
00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:00.301
because of the micro-noises you're receiving.

41
00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:02.908
And sound places us in time as well.
[AI] 声音也能让我们及时到达目的地。

42
00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:06.392
because sound always has time embedded in it.
[AI] 因为声音总是有时间在里面。

43
00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:09.338
In fact. I would suggest that our listening is the main way
[AI] 事实上我认为我们的倾听是主要的方式

44
00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.919
that we experience the flow of time from past to future.
[AI] 我们经历了从过去到未来的时间流。

45
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.555

46
00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.020
I said at the beginning. we're losing our listening.
