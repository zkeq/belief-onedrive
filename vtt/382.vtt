I saw the security guard run his hand across the concrete wall.

I could see that the security guard was moved by the building

"Wow. How does architecture do that?"

At school, I was learning to design,

but here -- here was a reaction of the heart.

for sensuousness, for atmosphere, the emotional response.

a chance to try.

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:45.301
So in 2003, there was an open call for designs for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.
在2003年，有个为南美巴哈伊灵曦堂公开的设计征集

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.434
a hugely important milestone for the Bahá'í community,
是巴哈伊教社区的一个非常重要的里程碑

26
00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:57.690
because this would be the last of the continental temples

28
00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:06.193
And the brief was deceptively simple

29
00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:09.866
and unique in the annals of religion:

No pulpit, no sermons,

as there are no clergy in the Bahá'í faith.

35
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.935
And in a world which is putting up walls,

36
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.716
the design needed to express in form the very opposite.

It was like designing one of the first churches for Christianity

44
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.712
or one of the first mosques for Islam.

45
00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:18.455

46
00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:25.442
How do you design sacred space today?

And how do you even define what's sacred today?

48
00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:37.797
I stumbled across this beautiful quote from the Bahá'í writings,
我偶然看到这个来自于巴哈伊教文字的美丽的用语

49
00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.629
and it speaks to prayer.

50
00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:43.361
It says that if you reach out in prayer,

51
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.495
and if your prayer is answered -- which is already very interesting --

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.949
that the pillars of your heart will become ashine.
那么你心中伫立的柱子就会变得发亮

53
00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.816
And I loved this idea of the inner and the outer,

54
00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:03.118
like when you see someone and you say, "That person is radiant."

55
00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:11.118
And I was thinking, "My gosh, how could we make something architectural out of that,
然后我就在想：“天哪我们怎么把这样的想法通过建筑变成现实呢

56
00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:18.159
where you create a building and it becomes alive with light?
你创造出一栋建筑然后它随着光生动起来？“

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.360
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light, it becomes alive.
就像雪花石膏一样，如果你用光“亲吻”它，它会活起来

58
00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:25.526
And I drew this sketch,
然后我画了这张草图

something with two layers, translucent with structure in between capturing light.

61
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:44.400
that you could imagine would be all dome

63
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.529
(Laughter)

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:07.146
I saw this little video of a plant moving in light,

because we needed a form.
