147
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:53.820

148
00:06:53.844 --> 00:06:57.410
And then what we can do now is we can do instant comparisons

of things in their homes.

Let's look in their cutlery drawer.

151
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.688
So, observe the Hadleys:

154
00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:14.432
while the Howards, they have this wooden drawer

with small wooden compartments in it

and a section for each type of cutlery.

157
00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:22.085
We can add more families,

158
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.649
and we can see kitchen sinks,

Of course, we can do the same in other countries.
当然，我们也可以去其它 国家做相同的事。

161
00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:32.639
So we go to China, we pick three families.

162
00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:34.941
we look at their houses,

we can look at their stoves.
他们的炉灶。

165
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.579
And when you see these stoves,
当你看这些炉灶时，

166
00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:43.415
I think it's obvious that it's a stupid thing
我认为，很明显， 有一种愚昧的想法，

167
00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:46.631
that usually, when we think about other countries,

168
00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:49.183
we think they have a certain way of doing things.

170
00:07:50.623 --> 00:07:52.099
Very different, right,
很不一样是吧，

171
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:54.444
because it depends on what income level you have,
那是因为炉灶会因 收入阶级而改变，

172
00:07:54.468 --> 00:07:56.329
how you're going to cook your food.

173
00:07:56.353 --> 00:08:00.387
But the cool thing is when we start comparing across countries.

So here we have China and the US.

175
00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:06.363
See the big overlap between these two.
这两个国家有一大部分是重叠的。

176
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.667
So we picked the two homes we have already seen in these countries,

Standing in their bedroom,

00:08:14.604 --> 00:08:18.588
pretty hard to tell which one is China and which one is the US, right?

180
00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:20.903
Both have brown leather sofas,

181
00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:23.007
and they have similar play structures.
他们有相似的游乐场。

182
00:08:22.747 --> 00:08:24.607
Most likely both are made in China,

183
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:26.644
so, I mean, that's not very strange --

184
00:08:26.668 --> 00:08:27.779
(Laughter)
（笑声）

185
00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:29.196
but that is similar.
它们看起来相似就不足为奇了。

186
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.899
We can of course go down to the other end of the street,

187
00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:33.532
adding Nigeria.

188
00:08:33.556 --> 00:08:37.485
So let's compare two homes in China and Nigeria.
现在我们来比较一下分别来自 中国和尼日利亚的两个家庭。

189
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:39.325
Looking at the family photos,

190
00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:42.484
they do not look like they have a lot in common, do they?

191
00:08:42.508 --> 00:08:44.534
But start seeing their ceiling.

192
00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:46.696
They have a plastic shield and grass.

they're going to have fish for dinner,

and they're boiling their water in identical ways.
还用一模一样的方式烧水。

197
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.174
So if we would visit any of these homes,

198
00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:04.938
there's a huge risk that we would say we know anything
我们很有可能会说，我们知道

199
00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:09.278
about the specific way you do things in China or Nigeria,

this is how you do things on this income level.

206
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.902
We're going to look at comparisons of things in the poorest group:

their homes are chosen

But what we see is pretty identical.
