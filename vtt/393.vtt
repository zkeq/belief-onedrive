it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden.

because in moments of stillness,

I found myself counting seconds again.

And yet, it didn't bring about closure for me.

171
00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:07.660
Perhaps because the email format didn't feel personal enough,
也许，是因为电子邮件的形式，并不够私人化，

172

perhaps because it's easy to be brave when you're hiding behind a computer screen on the other side of the planet.
也许，是因为躲藏在地球另一边的电脑屏幕前，勇敢，变得容易一些。

173
00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:15.537

that I felt was necessary to explore to its fullest.

We followed a strict policy of being honest,

an acceptance that I did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me;
接受，我的确伤害了，站在我身边的这位美好的女性；

comes the responsibility of using it.
