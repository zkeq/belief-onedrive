I'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me.

In this space, there is very little context,

7
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.314
and so you move into a different one,

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.912
one filled with people.

9
00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:40.207
Surely, now you know you're not a figment of your own imagination.

13
00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:50.808
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:

Do I only exist when people speak to me?

Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?

16
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:05.329
But through various artworks that reflect upon our society,

觉得好像没人看得见她，甚至是她根本不存在。

19
00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:19.926
You see, if young people don't have positive images of themselves

and all that remains are negative stereotypes,

21
00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:24.967
this affects their self-image.

22
00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:29.380
But it also affects the way that the rest of society treats them.

I discovered this having lived in Cape Town for about five years at the time.

I couldn't see myself represented.
