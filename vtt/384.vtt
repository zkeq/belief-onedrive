59
00:03:53.572 --> 00:03:56.477
think that what happens online doesn't actually happen.

that grooming was strictly a precursor to arranging an in-person meeting with a kid to have sex with them.
网络性诱拐只是诱骗者与儿童安排个人见面并发生与之性关系的前兆。

67
00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:33.671
But they didn't think about what happened to the kids who were exposed

00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:36.753
by talking about sex with an adult without knowing it,
他们和成年人讨论性话题却浑然不知，

69
00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:41.470
or who shared intimate photos thinking only another kid would see them,

who had exposed themselves using their web cam.

我相信你们中的很多人认为不通过身体接触去猥亵另一个人纯属无稽之谈。

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.742
We're programmed to think that way.

That day, her parents asked us, in tears,

to tell them the magic formula

89
00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:53.513

90
00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:56.867
to be their last disappointment, telling them it was too late:
我成了最后一根救命稻草，却不得不告诉他们已经太迟了，

once content is online,

92
00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:01.569
we've already lost control.

93
00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:06.621
Since that day, I think about that girl

94
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.913
waking up in the morning, having breakfast with her family, who had seen the video,
想着她在早上醒来后，便与曾看过她的录像的父母共进早餐；

and then walking to school, meeting people that had seen her naked,
随后她走去学校，去见那些曾看过她裸体的人；

96

arriving to school, playing with her friends, who had also seen her.
到了学校后，和那些同样看过的朋友一起玩。

Of course, nobody raped her body.

100
00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:39.427
But hadn't her sexuality been abused?

101
00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:46.366
We clearly use different standards to measure physical and digital things.
很明显，我们用不同的标准来衡量物理上和数据上的事物。

102
00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:51.119
And we get angry at social networks
此外，我们还将怒火转向社交网络，

103
00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:55.133
because being angry with ourselves is more painful and more true.
因为相较之下对我们自己的愤怒会更加疼痛、真切。

104
00:06:56.595 --> 00:07:01.190
And this brings us to the second reason why we aren't paying proper attention to this issue.
而这便引出了我们没有给予这些问题恰当关注的第二个原因。

105
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.489
We're convinced that kids don't need our help,

take the route we showed you, be at home at the time we said,
按我们教你的路线走，按我们约定的时间回家，

114
00:07:35.963 --> 00:07:38.702
cross at the corner, and look both ways before you cross,
在拐角处过马路，过马路前记得左右看看，

115
00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:42.514
and no matter what, don't talk to strangers.”
最重要的是不要和陌生人说话。”

116
00:07:44.787 --> 00:07:46.817
I knew everything about walking,
我当然知道该如何走路。

117
00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:51.441
and yet, there was a responsible adult there taking care of me.
但以前有负责任的大人在照顾我。

118
00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.682
Knowing how to do something is one thing,
知道如何做一件事是一回事，

119
00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:57.038
knowing how to take care of yourself is another.
而知道如何照顾自己则是另一回事。

120
00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:00.357
Imagine this situation:
想像一下这样一个场景：

121
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.945
I'm 10 or 11 years old, I wake up in the morning,

124
00:08:08.307 --> 00:08:10.507
And when I come back late,
而直到有一天我晚回家时，

125
00:08:11.355 --> 00:08:14.772
they say, “No, you need to be home at the time we said.”
他们才说：“不能这样，你必须按时回家。”

126
00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:18.510
And two weeks later,
在两周之后，

127
00:08:18.534 --> 00:08:21.643
when it comes up, they say, “You know what?
他们才突然想起来要叮嘱我：“你知道吗，

128
00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.013

“And also, don't talk to strangers.”

It sounds absurd, right?

132
00:08:38.132 --> 00:08:41.022
We have the same absurd behavior in relation to technology.
然而在处理与科技的关系时，我们也有相同的荒唐行为。

133
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:44.092
We give kids total access
我们让儿童随意接触它们，

134
00:08:44.116 --> 00:08:46.956
and we see if one day, sooner or later,
因为我们相信迟早有一天

135
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.147
they learn how to take care of themselves.
他们会学会如何照顾自己。

136
00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.766
Knowing how to do something is one thing,

137
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.227
knowing how to take care of yourself is another.

138
00:08:56.523 --> 00:08:59.100
Along those same lines, when we talk to parents,
同样地，当我们和父母们聊天时，

139
00:08:59.124 --> 00:09:04.619
