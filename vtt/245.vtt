than on housing, slightly more,

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.652
because of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,"

finding homes further and further and further

00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:49.212
they were decimated.

it's going to set other priorities?

75
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.998
And probably the best example we have here

76
00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:17.409
in America is Portland, Oregon.

And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,

91
00:03:56.624 --> 00:03:58.057
which seems like a lot of money,

92
00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:00.573
but it was spent over about 30 years,

93
00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.942
so two million dollars a year -- not that much --

94
00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.267
and half the price of the one cloverleaf

of all income earned in the region.

112
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.959
So if they're not spending that money on driving --

117
00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:53.489
Well, Portland is reputed to have
从人均占有量上看, 波特兰有很多第一

118
00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:56.411
the most roof racks per capita,

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.214
which may be a good thing or a bad thing,

128
00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:19.213
but it makes you glad they're driving less.

an investment as you can get.
留在本地的消费

which is that young, educated people

136
00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:37.898
have been moving to Portland in droves,

so that between the last two censuses,

in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.

by being more walkable and more bikeable,

144
