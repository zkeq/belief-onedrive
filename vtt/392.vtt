1
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.420
Most of us go through life trying to do our best at whatever we do, whether it's our job, family, school or anything else.
这一辈子，不管是我们的工作事务、家庭琐事、学校任务，或是其他，我们大都尽己所能，做到最好，

2
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.860
I feel that way. I try my best.
我这么想，也这么做。

3
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.636
But some time ago, I came to a realization
但是一段时间以前，我意识到，

4
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.436
that I wasn't getting much better at the things I cared most about,
我在我最在乎的事情上并没有进步， 

5
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.916
whether it was being a husband or a friend or a professional or teammate, and I wasn't improving much at those things
不管是作为丈夫或是朋友，或是专家，或者队友。

6
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.916
even though I was spending a lot of time
即使我在这些事上花费了大量时间，

7
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.700
working hard at them.
做了很多努力，我却没有太多进步。

8
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.396
I've since realized from conversations I've had and from research
我之后在与他人的谈话和研究中意识到， 

9
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.076
that this stagnation, despite hard work,
这种白白耗费努力的停滞，

10
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.836
turns out to be pretty common.
原来非常普遍。

11
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.716
So I'd like to share with you some insights into why that is
所以我想与大家分享一些，

12
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.264
and what we can all do about it.
关于它为何发生和如何应对的见解。

13
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.476
What I've learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain
我所了解的是，无论哪个领域，最高效的个人和团队，

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.140
do something we can all emulate.
都会做一件我们可以效仿的事情：

15
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.876
They go through life deliberately alternating between two zones:
生活中，他们有意识的在两个区域转换：

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.980
the learning zone and the performance zone.
学习区和展现区。

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.636
The learning zone is when our goal is to improve.
在学习区，我们希冀进步，

18
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.756
Then we do activities designed for improvement,
我们为了进步而计划行为，

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.236
concentrating on what we haven't mastered yet,
将精力集中在那些我们还没有掌握的东西上，

20
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.716
which means we have to expect to make mistakes,
我们意识到自己会犯错，

21
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.540
knowing that we will learn from them.
并且知道我们会从中汲取什么教训。

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.716
That is very different from what we do when we're in our performance zone,
这和我们在展现区做的完全不同，

23
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.036
which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can, to execute.
在展现区我们的目标是做到最好，去执行，

24
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.676
Then we concentrate on what we have already mastered
我们在已经掌握的东西上集中精力，

25
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.460
and we try to minimize mistakes.
并尽力把错误缩小。

26
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.076
Both of these zones should be part of our lives,
这两个区域都应是我们生活的一部分，

27
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.356
but being clear about when we want to be in each of them,
但是在进入区域之前，想清楚我们进的是哪个区，

28
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.676
with what goal, focus and expectations,
我们的目标是什么、精力放在哪、有什么样的期望，

29
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.516
helps us better perform and better improve.
这会帮助我们更好的提升或表现

30
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.476
The performance zone maximizes our immediate performance,
在展现区将展现最大化，

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.596
while the learning zone maximizes our growth
在学习区将进步最大化

32
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.906
and our future performance.
并在未来的展现中将其表现。

33
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.956
The reason many of us don't improve much despite our hard work
我们努力工作却没有太多进步的原因，

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.980
is that we tend to spend almost all of our time in the performance zone.
是我们往往将时间都花在了展现区里。

35
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.076
This hinders our growth,
这阻碍着我们的进步，

36
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.180
and ironically, over the long term, also our performance.
更讽刺的是，长久来看，这也影响着我们的展现。

37
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.820
So what does the learning zone look like?
那学习区是什么样的呢？

38
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.460
Take Demosthenes, a political leader and the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient Greece.
看看古希腊的政治领导者、最伟大的演说家、律师，狄摩西尼吧。

39
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.156
To become great, he didn't spend all his time just being an orator or a lawyer,
为了成就伟大，他没有把所有时间花费在仅仅作为演说家或者律师上--

40
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.356
which would be his performance zone.
也就是他展现区的一部分。

41
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.000
But instead, he did activities designed for improvement.
反而，他为了进步规划行为，

42
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.796
Of course, he studied a lot.
是的，他大量地学习。

43
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.636
He studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors,
他不仅在导师的帮助下学习法律和哲学，

44
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.196
but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people,
他还意识到了律师的职责包括说服他人，

45
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.820
so he also studied great speeches and acting.
所以他研习了许多伟大的演说和表演。

46
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.756
To get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder,
为了戒掉他不自主抬胳膊的习惯，

47
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.196
he practiced his speeches in front of a mirror,
他在一面镜子前练习演说，

48
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.196
and he suspended a sword from the ceiling
并将一把剑吊在房梁上，

49
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.956
so that if he raised his shoulder,
这样如果他抬起了肩膀，

50
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.196
it would hurt.
剑就会刺痛他。

51
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.836
(Laughter)
（笑声）

52
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.996
To speak more clearly despite a lisp,
为了发音清晰，

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.860
he went through his speeches with stones in his mouth.
他在演说时嘴里含着石头。

54
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.036
He built an underground room
他还建造了一个地下室，

55
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.196
where he could practice without interruptions
这样他在练习的时候就不会被打扰，

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.636
and not disturb other people.
也不会打扰到别人。

57
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.796
And since courts at the time were very noisy,
因为那时候的法庭很嘈杂，

58
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.676
he also practiced by the ocean,
对此他在海边练习，

59
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.260
projecting his voice above the roar of the waves.
保证声音在海浪的咆哮中清晰可听。

60
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.916
His activities in the learning zone
他在学习区所做的行为，

61
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.740
were very different from his activities in court, his performance zone.
和他在法庭上的行为，也就是他展现区的行为，远远不同。

62
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.796
In the learning zone,
在学习区，

63
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.596
he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice.
安德斯•埃里克森博士称这种行为为“有意练习”，

64
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.156
This involves breaking down abilities into component skills,
这种练习包括了将能力转化为所需技能，

65
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.076
being clear about what subskill we're working to improve,
对我们需要提升什么非主要技能非常清楚，

66
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.076
like keeping our shoulders down,
就像狄摩西尼将肩膀放低，

67
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.956
giving full concentration to a high level of challenge
还有将精力集中在我们舒适区之外、

68
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.396
outside our comfort zone,
更高一级的挑战，

69
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.756
just beyond what we can currently do,
做超越我们现在正做的事，

70
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.996
using frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments,
在重复和调整中得到反馈，

71
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.996
and ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach,
最好能得到熟练者的指导，

72
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.356
because activities designed for improvement are domain-specific,
因为为了进步而设定行为是件很内行的事。

73
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.276
and great teachers and coaches know what those activities are
好的老师和教练了解什么行为能带来进步，

74
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180
and can also give us expert feedback.
也能给我们专业的反馈。

75
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.476
It is this type of practice in the learning zone
学习区中，给我们带来很大的进步的，

76
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.780
which leads to substantial improvement, not just time on task performing.
正是这样的练习，而不是单纯的完成任务。

77
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.236
For example, research shows that after the first couple of years working in a profession,
例如，研究表明，在某一行业最初工作的几年，

78
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.580
performance usually plateaus.
展现的进步会停滞。

79
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.396
This has been shown to be true in teaching, general medicine, nursing and other fields,
这已经在教育、普通内科、护理和其他领域都到了印证，

80
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.396
and it happens because once we think we have become good enough, adequate,
我们一旦认为自己足够好、足够适合工作，而停止学习，

81
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.676
then we stop spending time in the learning zone.
它就会发生在我们身上。

82
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.876
We focus all our time on just doing our job,
我们仅是把时间花费在完成工作上，

83
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.116
performing,
也就是展现，

84
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.460
which turns out not to be a great way to improve.
这决不是进步的好方法。

85
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.916
But the people who continue to spend time in the learning zone
而那些继续在学习区花费时间的人，

86
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.076
do continue to always improve.
确实在不停进步。

87
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.516
The best salespeople at least once a week
最好的推销员至少每周一次，

88
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.156
do activities with the goal of improvement.
进行自我提高的活动。

89
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.956
They read to extend their knowledge,
他们通过阅读拓展知识，

90
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.396
consult with colleagues or domain experts,
与同事或行业专家交换意见，

91
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
try out new strategies, solicit feedback and reflect.
尝试新的策略、征集反馈并以此作出反应。

92
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.796
The best chess players
最好的国际象棋棋手，

93
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.356
spend a lot of time not playing games of chess,
并没有将大部分时间花在他们的表现区——

94
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.316
which would be their performance zone,
也就是下象棋上，

95
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.820
but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them.
而是努力去预测象棋大师的着子并加以分析。

96
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.836
Each of us has probably spent many, many, many hours
我们在电脑打字上，

97
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.396
typing on a computer
花费了很多时间

98
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.996
without getting faster,
却没有打得更快，

99
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.436
but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day
但是我们如果每天都能抽出10-20分钟，

100
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.636
fully concentrating on typing 10 to 20 percent faster
全神贯注地提升打字速度，

101
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.236
than our current reliable speed,
就比平常快上10%-20%，

102
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.516
we would get faster,
我们打字的速度就会提升，

103
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.556
especially if we also identified what mistakes we're making
尤其是我们还找出了我们常犯的错，

104
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.540
and practiced typing those words.
并且还加以纠正练习。

105
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.620
That's deliberate practice.
这就是“有意练习”。

106
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.836
In what other parts of our lives,
打字毕竟不是主业，

107
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.556
perhaps that we care more about,
我们有其他更在乎的领域，

108
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.116
are we working hard but not improving much
那些我们努力过，但是提升甚少的领域，

109
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.460
because we're always in the performance zone?
这是因为我们总停留在展现区吗？

110
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.356
Now, this is not to say that the performance zone has no value.
这并不意味展现区毫无价值，

111
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.596
It very much does.
它非常有价值。

112
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.276
When I needed a knee surgery, I didn't tell the surgeon,
我不会告诉我膝盖手术的主治医生：

113
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.956
"Poke around in there and focus on what you don't know."
“随便弄吧，把膝盖当作你的教具，”

114
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.996
(Laughter)
（笑声）

115
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.620
"We'll learn from your mistakes!"
“你犯错了我们都会吸取教训的！”

116
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.756
I looked for a surgeon who I felt would do a good job,
我会找一个我认为能做好手术的外科医生，

117
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.420
and I wanted her to do a good job.
我也想让她顺利完成手术。

118
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.396
Being in the performance zone
在展现区做事，

119
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.060
allows us to get things done as best as we can.
要求我们做到最好。

120
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.996
It can also be motivating,
这本身就是一种鞭策，

121
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.596
and it provides us with information to identify what to focus on next
它也能让我们知道，当我们回到学习区的时候，

122
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.916
when we go back to the learning zone.
我们应当注意什么。

123
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.636
So the way to high performance
通往高水平展现的路，

124
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.356
is to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone,
就是在学习区、表现区间来回转换的路，

125
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.916
purposefully building our skills in the learning zone,
我们有目的地在学习区积攒技能，

126
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.340
then applying those skills in the performance zone.
然后将其应用于展现区。

127
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.396
When Beyoncé is on tour,
当碧昂斯举办巡回演唱会时，

128
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.596
during the concert, she's in her performance zone,
演唱会，就是她的展现区，

129
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.116
but every night when she gets back to the hotel room,
但是当她每晚回到酒店房间时，

130
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.356
she goes right back into her learning zone.
她就径直地回到了她的学习区。

131
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.156
She watches a video of the show that just ended.
她会观看刚刚结束的演出的录像。

132
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.956
She identifies opportunities for improvement, for herself, her dancers and her camera staff.
为她自己、舞者、摄像组寻求进步的突破口。

133
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.236
And the next morning,
第二天早上，

134
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.316
everyone receives pages of notes with what to adjust,
每个人都会收到几页笔记，上面写着

135
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.316
which they then work on during the day before the next performance.
他们需要在下次演出前需要调整的问题。

136
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.156
It's a spiral to ever-increasing capabilities,
提高能力是一个螺旋上升的过程，

137
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.796
but we need to know when we seek to learn, and when we seek to perform,
但是我们得知道何时学习、何时表现，

138
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.876
and while we want to spend time doing both,
当想两者兼顾时，

139
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.260
the more time we spend in the learning zone, the more we'll improve.
想要进步，就要多花时间在学习区上。

140
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.580
So how can we spend more time in the learning zone?
那我们如何将更多时间用在学习区上呢？

141
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.396
First, we must believe and understand that we can improve,
首先，坚定我们一定会进步的信念，

142
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.940
what we call a growth mindset.
我们叫它“成长思维”。

143
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.916
Second, we must want to improve at that particular skill.
其次，成长目标必须明确。

144
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.876
There has to be a purpose we care about,
时间、精力有限，

145
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.500
because it takes time and effort.
它们必须花费在我们在乎的目标上。

146
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.196
Third, we must have an idea about how to improve,
第三，我们必须要知道如何提高，

147
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.916
what we can do to improve,
怎样提高，

148
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.516
not how I used to practice the guitar as a teenager,
不能像小时候学吉他，

149
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.636
performing songs over and over again,
一遍遍重复单调的歌曲，

150
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.140
but doing deliberate practice.
而是做一些有意的练习。

151
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.380
And fourth, we must be in a low-stakes situation,
第四，保证低风险，

152
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.196
because if mistakes are to be expected,
因为犯错在意料之中，

153
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.236
then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic,
其后果必不能不堪设想，

154
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.500
or even very significant.
哪怕是有一点严重都不行。

155
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.756
A tightrope walker doesn't practice new tricks without a net underneath,
没有拦网，走钢索的人不会去训练新技巧，

156
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.754
and an athlete wouldn't set out to first try a new move during a championship match.
在大赛上，运动员也不会去开发新的动作。

157
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.076
One reason that in our lives we spend so much time in the performance zone
我们之所以在展现区耗费大量时间，

158
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:53.180
is that our environments often are, unnecessarily, high stakes.
是因为我们通常不必要地将环境置于高风险的状态。

159
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.236
We create social risks for one another,
我们给彼此制造了社会风险，

160
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.116
even in schools which are supposed to be all about learning,
即使在我们一切都为了学习的学校里，

161
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.276
and I'm not talking about standardized tests.
我没有在说标准化考试，

162
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.516
I mean that every minute of every day,
我说的是学生每时每刻、

163
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.236
many students in elementary schools through colleges
从小学到大学，

164
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.676
feel that if they make a mistake, others will think less of them.
都会觉得别人会因为他们犯错而轻视他们。

165
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.636
No wonder they're always stressed out
难怪学生一直紧张兮兮，

166
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.900
and not taking the risks necessary for learning.
不愿为学习而冒必要的风险。

167
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.836
But they learn that mistakes are undesirable
老师、家长对正确答案趋之若鹜的态度，

168
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.116
inadvertently
无意中

169
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.636
when teachers or parents are eager to hear just correct answers
让学生抗拒犯错，

170
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.596
and reject mistakes rather than welcome and examine them to learn from them,
而不是勇于试错、检视过错、并从中吸取教训，

171
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.356
or when we look for narrow responses
我们也只想要“标准答案”，

172
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.956
rather than encourage more exploratory thinking that we can all learn from.
而不是激励学生去进行大有裨益的开拓性思考。

173
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.076
When all homework or student work has a number or a letter on it,
一旦学生的作业、作品，都会被评定等级、标上分数，

174
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.836
and counts towards a final grade,
最后被记入期末成绩，

175
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.436
rather than being used for practice, mistakes, feedback and revision,
它们就起不到练习、试错、反馈、修正的作用了，

176
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.660
we send the message that school is a performance zone.
我们让孩子误认为学校是展现区。

177
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.116
The same is true in our workplaces.
职场中也同样如此。

178
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.156
In the companies I consult with, I often see flawless execution cultures
那些咨询我的公司，经常执行无缺陷企业文化，

179
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.756
which leaders foster to encourage great work.
领导们努力于激励工作。

180
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.316
But that leads employees to stay within what they know
但这会让员工停留在自己已知的领域，

181
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.596
and not try new things,
固步自封，

182
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.956
so companies struggle to innovate and improve,
公司因此很难创新、进步，

183
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.180
and they fall behind.
从而落了下风。

184
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.076
We can create more spaces for growth
我们可以通过交流，

185
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.156
by starting conversations with one another
为彼此开创进步的空间，

186
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.460
about when we want to be in each zone.
可以让行为各属所区的空间。

187
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.756
What do we want to get better at and how?
何处改进？如何改进？

188
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.780
And when do we want to execute and minimize mistakes?
何时决策？怎样控损？

189
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.516
That way, we gain clarity about what success is,
何为成功，何时、以何种方法去支持对方，

190
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.620
when, and how to best support one another.
由此在我们眼前清晰展现。

191
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.916
But what if we find ourselves in a chronic high-stakes setting
那要是我们发现自己长期都在高风险状态下，

192
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.660
and we feel we can't start those conversations yet?
并且无法开展这样的交流怎么办？

193
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.636
Then here are three things that we can still do as individuals.
作为个人，我们仍可以做这下面三点：

194
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.940
First, we can create low-stakes islands in an otherwise high-stakes sea.
首先，我们可以在高风险的汪洋中开辟一个低风险的小岛，

195
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.196
These are spaces where mistakes have little consequence.
在这里，错误的后果不会太严重，

196
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.676
For example, we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague
比如，我们可以找一个导师，或是可信的同事，

197
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.876
with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable conversations
和他们分享想法，或是接受批评，

198
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.276
or even role-play.
甚至角色代入都行。

199
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.916
Or we can ask for feedback-oriented meetings as projects progress.
或者是随着项目的进展，举办反馈向会议。

200
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.076
Or we can set aside time to read or watch videos or take online courses.
我们也可以抽出时间去阅读相关书籍、看视频或是参加在线课程。

201
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.500
Those are just some examples.
这只是几个例子。

202
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.356
Second, we can execute and perform as we're expected,
其次，我们可以遵循着预期去执行，

203
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.956
but then reflect on what we could do better next time,
但将精力集中于如何在下次做的更好，

204
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.236
like Beyoncé does,
就像碧昂斯，

205
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.396
and we can observe and emulate experts.
我们可以观察并模仿专家所做。

206
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.940
The observation, reflection and adjustment is a learning zone.
这些观察、映射和调整属于学习区。

207
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.900
And finally, we can lead
最终，我们可以通过和他人分享希冀在何处取得进步，

208
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.156
and lower the stakes for others by sharing what we want to get better at,
通过询问未知的问题，

209
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.676
by asking questions about what we don't know,
通过征求反馈，

210
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.196
by soliciting feedback and by sharing our mistakes
通过分享我们曾经犯过的错，和从中汲取的教训，

211
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.836
and what we've learned from them,
为彼此营造一个低风险的状态，

212
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.940
so that others can feel safe to do the same.
这样他人也会安心地做同样的事。

213
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.100
Real confidence is about modeling ongoing learning.
进步的奥秘就在规范现行的学习行为中。

214
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.156
What if, instead of spending our lives doing, doing, doing,
如果，我们没有把时间耗费在

215
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.276
performing, performing, performing,
做事、表现、输出上，

216
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.580
we spent more time exploring,
而是更多地去探索、

217
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.876
asking,
询问、

218
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.196
listening,
倾听、

219
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.316
experimenting, reflecting,
实践、斟酌、

220
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.820
striving and becoming?
拼命去成为想成为的人，会怎么样？

221
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.500
What if we each always had something we were working to improve?
如果我们每个人，都有某些事情让我们可为之努力，从而提高呢？

222
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.220
What if we created more low-stakes islands and waters?
如果我们可以找到，或者创造出更多的低风险地带呢？

223
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.516
And what if we got clear, within ourselves and with our teammates,
那如果我们对于自身和团队成员，

224
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.076
about when we seek to learn and when we seek to perform,
何时需要学习，何时需要表现非常清楚呢？

225
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.156
so that our efforts can become more consequential,
做到这些，我们的努力会得到更多回报，

226
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.836
our improvement never-ending
我们的进步会一往直前，

227
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.140
and our best even better?
我们的工作会锦上添花。

228
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.020
Thank you.
谢谢大家。
