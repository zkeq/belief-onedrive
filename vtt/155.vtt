Did you ever lie as a child?

If you did, could you please raise your hand?

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.133
So for the last 20 years,

8
00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:33.572
I've been studying how children learn to tell lies.

11
00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:43.369
But to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina,
不过首先我想先讲一个 理查德·梅西纳先生的故事。

12
00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:46.522
who is my friend and an elementary school principal.
他是我的朋友 也是一名小学校长。

13
00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.647

The caller says,

16
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.643

17
00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:00.054
Mr. Messina asks,
梅西纳先生问道

18
00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:02.092
"Who am I speaking to, please?"
”请问您是谁？“

19
00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:04.098
And the caller says,

"I am my father."
”我是我爸爸。“

21
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.598
(Laughter)
（笑声）

22
00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.729
So this story --
所以这个故事--

23
00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:13.285
(Laughter)
（笑声）

24
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:17.619
sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have
很好的总结了三个我们

25
00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.502
about children and lying.
对于孩子撒谎的常识。

26
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.591
One, children only come to tell lies
第一，孩子通常在上小学后

27
00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:26.883
after entering elementary school.
开始撒谎。

Two, children are poor liars.
第二，孩子不会撒谎

29
00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:32.564
We adults can easily detect their lies.
成人可以简单地识破他们。

30
00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:36.626
And three, if children lie at a very young age,
第三，如果孩子很早就开始撒谎

31
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.499
there must be some character flaws with them,
那么他们一定有一些人格缺陷，

32
00:01:39.523 --> 00:01:43.572
and they are going to become pathological liars for life.
并且一生都将是病态的撒谎者。

33
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.734
Well, it turns out
然而结果是，

34
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:49.056
all of the three beliefs are wrong.
这三个认识都是错的

35
00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:53.147
We have been playing guessing games
之前我们一直和全世界的

36
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.253
with children all over the world.
孩子们一起玩竞猜游戏。

37
00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:56.763
Here is an example.
这里有一个例子。

38
00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:01.152
So in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards.
在这个游戏中， 我们请孩子们猜测卡片上的数字。

39
00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:04.656
And we tell them if they win the game,

40
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.837
they are going to get a big prize.
他们会得到丰厚的奖励。

41
00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:08.822
But in the middle of the game,
在游戏的中间，

42
00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:11.606
we make an excuse and leave the room.
我们会借故离开。

43
00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.517
And before we leave the room,
离开前会告诉孩子们

44
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.477
we tell them not to peek at the cards.
不要去偷偷看卡片。

45
00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:20.754

47

49
00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:32.963
more than 90 percent of children will peek

or lie about their transgression?

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:56.118
We found that regardless of gender, country, religion,

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.768
70 percent tell the truth about their transgression.

50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth.

00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:13.021
At four years of age,

more than 80 percent lie.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.605
And after four years of age,

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.018
most children lie.
绝大部分都在撒谎。

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.363
So as you can see,
如您所见，

68
00:03:22.387 --> 00:03:25.850
lying is really a typical part of development.
撒谎是成长典型的一部分。

as young as two years of age.
就已经学会了撒谎。

71
00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:35.815
So now, let's take a closer look at the younger children.

72
00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:40.969
Why do some but not all young children lie?
为什么不是所有的孩子都撒谎？

73
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:45.333
In cooking, you need good ingredients

74
00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:46.970
to cook good food.

75
00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:52.176
And good lying requires two key ingredients.
一个好的谎言需要两个关键的原料。

76
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:57.039
The first key ingredient is theory of mind,
第一个是心智理论，

77
00:03:57.063 --> 00:03:58.898
or the mind-reading ability.
换言之读心的能力。

78
00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:01.666
Mind reading is the ability to know
读心能力是一种

79
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.298
that different people have different knowledge about the situation
知道相同情况下 不同的人知道不同的事情的能力，

80
00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:10.123
and the ability to differentiate between what I know
是一种 可以区分我知道什么

81
00:04:10.147 --> 00:04:11.370
and what you know.
和你知道什么的能力。

82
00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:13.981
Mind reading is important for lying
读心在撒谎时能力很重要

83
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:17.852
because the basis of lying is that I know
因为撒谎从根本上说

84
00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:19.027
you don't know
就是我知道你不知道

85
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:20.202
what I know.
我知道。

86
00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.597
Therefore, I can lie to you.
因此我的谎言成功了。

87
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.500
The second key ingredient for good lying is self-control.
第二个撒谎的 关键因素是自我控制

88
00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:32.147
It is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression
控制语言 控制面部表情

89
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.711
and your body language,
控制身体动作。

90
00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:35.813
so that you can tell a convincing lie.
这样的谎言才让人信服。

91
00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:40.484
And we found that those young children
我们发现那些小孩子中

92
00:04:40.508 --> 00:04:45.364
who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities
读心能力和自我控制能力更强的

93
00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:47.426
tell lies earlier
更早开始说谎

94
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.266
and are more sophisticated liars.
也成为了更老练的撒谎者。

95
00:04:51.707 --> 00:04:57.326
As it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us
事实证明 这两种能力

96
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.872
to function well in our society.
在社会中也是至关重要的。

97
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:05.003
In fact, deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities
并且读心能力和自我控制能力不足

98
00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:08.586
are associated with serious developmental problems,
经常和一些严重的 发展问题 比如多动症和自闭症

99
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.369
such as ADHD and autism.
联系在一起。

100
00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.890
So if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie,
所以当你发现你二岁的孩子开始撒谎

101
00:05:18.914 --> 00:05:20.898
instead of being alarmed,
不要惊慌

102
00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:22.414
you should celebrate --
你应该庆幸

103
00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:23.960
(Laughter)
（笑声）

104
00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:29.714
because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone
这意味着你的孩子进入了 典型发展的

105
00:05:29.738 --> 00:05:31.373
of typical development.
新的里程碑。

106
00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:36.041
Now, are children poor liars?
那么 孩子不会撒谎么？

107
00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:39.692
Do you think you can easily detect their lies?
你可以轻易的识破他们的谎言么？

108
00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:42.243
Would you like to give it a try?
你愿意试试么？

109
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.221
Yes? OK.
愿意？好的

110
00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:46.384
So I'm going to show you two videos.
我将要给各位看两段视频。

111
00:05:46.844 --> 00:05:47.995
In the videos,

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.076
the children are going to respond to a researcher's question,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.582

129
00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.676
(Laughter)
（笑声)

130
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.084
Now, we have played similar kinds of games
现在我们给很多

131
00:06:43.108 --> 00:06:47.733
with many, many adults from all walks of life.
从事各种行业的成年人

132

135
00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.206
And let's find out how these adults performed.
让我们看看成人识破谎言的表现。

136
00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.994
Because there are as many liars as truth tellers,
因为说真话和假话的孩子各一半，

137
00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:08.417
if you guess randomly,

138
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:12.511
there's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right.
你的正确率差不多50%。

139
00:07:12.535 --> 00:07:16.129
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,

140
00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:19.594
it means you are a terrible detector of children's lies.
说明你看不出孩子的谎言。

141
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.639
So let's start with undergrads and law school students,

142
00:07:24.663 --> 00:07:28.335
who typically have limited experience with children.
有限的本科生和法学院学生开始。

No, they cannot detect children's lies.

144
00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:34.058
Their performance is around chance.
他们只是随机的猜测。

145
00:07:34.082 --> 00:07:39.311
Now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers,
那么每天和孩子打交道的

146
00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:42.009
who work with children on a daily basis?
社会工作者和保护儿童的律师 做得如何呢？

147
00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:44.120
Can they detect children's lies?
他们可以分辨孩子的谎言么？

148
00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:46.595
No, they cannot.
不他们不能。

149
00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:47.664
(Laughter)
（笑声）

150
00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:49.160
What about judges,
法官呢？

151
00:07:49.184 --> 00:07:50.984
customs officers
海关官员，

152
00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.866
and police officers,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.533
who deal with liars on a daily basis?

00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:23.956
why children's lies are so difficult to detect.
为什么孩子的谎言不容易被识破?

164
00:08:24.778 --> 00:08:27.790
Let me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan.

166
00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:31.391
when he lies.
的面部表情。

167

(Laughter)
（笑声）

168
00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:35.247
So when children lie,
所以孩子撒谎是

169
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:38.427
their facial expression is typically neutral.
他们的面部表情是很自然的。

170
00:08:38.943 --> 00:08:42.403
However, behind this neutral expression,
然而在自然的表情背后

171
00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:45.753
the child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions,

174
00:08:52.776 --> 00:08:55.478
(Laughter)
（笑声）

175
00:08:55.502 --> 00:09:00.342
Unfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden.

176
00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:03.465
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.

177
00:09:03.489 --> 00:09:04.848
So in the last five years,

00:09:04.872 --> 00:09:08.768
we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions.

180
00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:14.278
We know that underneath our facial skin,

189
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:44.476
are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.

190
00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:49.220
So to help us reveal people's facial emotions,

191
00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:52.278
we have developed a new imaging technology

192
00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:55.451
we call "transdermal optical imaging."
