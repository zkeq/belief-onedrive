“你不会相信刚刚发生了什么！ 我现在好生气！”

3
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.540

4
00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:29.103
And they tell you a story about what happened to them

at the gym or at work or on their date last night.

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:34.916
And you listen and you try to understand why they're so mad.

7
00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.671
Maybe even secretly judge whether or not they should be so mad.

(Laughter)
（笑声）

9
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.905
And maybe you even offer some suggestions.
也许你甚至会提供一些建议。

10
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.469
Now, in that moment, you are doing essentially what I get to do every day,

11
00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:48.373
because I'm an anger researcher,

00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:52.727
and as an anger researcher, I spend a good part of my professional life --

13
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.529
who am I kidding, also my personal life --

whether it's getting into fights or breaking things,

(Laughter)

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.358

when people hear I'm an anger researcher,

they want to share with me their anger stories.

And it's not because they need a therapist,

25
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.470
though that does sometimes happen,

26
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.624
it's really because anger is universal.

29
00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:31.288
when we didn't get what we wanted in our cries of protests,
就比如当我们在无法得到我们 想要的东西时，我们抗议地哭泣，

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:34.723

(Laughter)

We feel it to the very end.

事实上，愤怒在我们人生中 一些最糟糕的时刻都如影随形。

bad weather, travel delays --
比如坏天气，旅途中的延误——

42
00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.660
that feel horrible in the moment,

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:08.960
but then are ultimately forgotten when things go OK.

I have a lot of conversations with people about their anger

46

and I bet many people in this room right now,

you see anger as a problem.

48
00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:21.122
You see the way it interferes in your life,

about your anger, and it's this:

56
00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:42.191
But to understand all that, we actually have to back up

57
00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:44.481
and talk about why we get mad in the first place.

58
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.313
A lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher

named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher, who wrote about this back in 1996
Jerry Deffenbacher博士 在1996年写了这本关于愤怒这方面的书，

60
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:54.080
in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger.
在该书的一个章节里面他提到了 如何处理有问题的愤怒。

61
00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:56.327
Now, for most of us, and I bet most of you,
对于我们中的大部分来说，， 我敢打赌你们中的大部分人

62
00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:58.293

I get mad when I'm provoked.

65

They say things like,

或者说，“我这么生气 是因为她又忘了把牛奶放回冰箱！”

68
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.068
Or my favorite,
我最爱这种说法，

69
00:03:10.472 --> 00:03:14.582
"I don't have an anger problem -- people just need to stop messing with me."

(Laughter)
（笑声）

71
00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:20.532
Now, in the spirit of better understanding those types of provocations,
回到现在，为了更好地理解 这些让人恼怒的类型，

72
00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:24.818
I ask a lot of people, including my friends and colleagues and even family,

By the way, now is a good time to point out one of the advantages

76
00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.492
of being an anger researcher
来指出作为一名 愤怒研究人员的一个优势，

77
00:03:32.842 --> 00:03:36.119

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:44.715
(Laughter)
（笑声）

81
00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.898

"people who chew too loudly."

85
00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:56.230
That is surprisingly common, by the way.
顺带一提，这是十分普遍的答案。

86
00:03:56.254 --> 00:03:59.334
"People who walk too slowly," that one's mine.
“那些人走路太慢让我生气”， 这是我的答案。

87
00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:01.769
And of course, "roundabouts."

88
00:04:01.793 --> 00:04:02.969
Roundabouts --

Sometimes their answers aren't minor at all.

their answers are very specific, maybe even oddly specific.

Super gross, right?

101
00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.857
(Laughter)
（笑声）

102
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.308

(Laughter)
（笑声）

105
00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:50.758
Now whether it's minor or major, whether it's general or specific,

106
00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:52.413
we can look at these examples
我们都可以通过研究这些样本

107
00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:55.068
and we can tease out some common themes.
挖掘出一些共同的主题。

108
00:04:55.092 --> 00:04:57.933
We get angry in situations that are unpleasant,
我们在令人不愉快的情况下会生气，

109
00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:00.623
that feel unfair, where our goals are blocked,
在感到不公时，在无法 达到目标的情况下会生气，

110
00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:03.761
that could have been avoided, and that leave us feeling powerless.

111
00:05:03.785 --> 00:05:05.585
This is a recipe for anger.
这就是愤怒的组成。

112
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.308
But you can also tell
但是你也可以分辨出

113
00:05:07.332 --> 00:05:11.181
that anger is probably not the only thing we're feeling in these situations.
愤怒也许不是我们在这些场景中 所感受到的唯一东西。

114
00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:12.834
Anger doesn't happen in a vacuum.
愤怒不会凭空而来。

115
00:05:12.858 --> 00:05:16.294
We can feel angry at the same time that we're scared or sad,

116
00:05:16.318 --> 00:05:18.849
or feeling a host of other emotions.
或者当感受到一大堆其他情绪的同时。

117
00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:20.326
But here's the thing:
但是要注意一点：

118
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.548
these provocations -- they aren't making us mad.
这些刺激其实并不会让我们生气。

119
00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:24.882
At least not on their own,
至少不是唯一的原因，

120
00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:26.769
and we know that, because if they were,
因为我们知道， 如果它们是生气的原因，

121
00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.873
we'd all get angry over the same things, and we don't.
我们会一直因为同一件 事情而生气，但是我们并没有。

122
00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:33.175
The reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry,
我生气的理由和你的不同，

123
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.317
so there's got to be something else going on.
所以一定有其它因素在起作用。

124
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:36.834
What is that something else?
这些因素是什么呢？

125
00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:42.127
Well, we know what we're doing and feeling at the moment of that provocation matters.
在受到刺激的时候， 我们知道自己的行为和想法。

126
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:45.881
We call this the pre-anger state -- are you hungry, are you tired,
我们将这种状态称作 “预生气状态”——你饿吗？你累吗？

127
00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:49.365
are you anxious about something else, are you running late for something?
你对其他事物感到焦虑吗？ 你快要迟到了吗？

128
00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.238
When you're feeling those things,
当你感受到了这些事情的时候，

129
00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:53.690
those provocations feel that much worse.
你会对这些刺激因素感觉更糟糕。

130
00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:56.945
But what matters most is not the provocation,
但是最重要的不是这些挑因素，

131
00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.540
it's not the pre-anger state, it's this:
也不是“预生气状态”，而是这个：

132
00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:01.437
it's how we interpret that provocation,
是我们如何去理解这些挑衅，

133
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.190
it's how we make sense of it in our lives.
是我们在生活中如何去理解它。

134
00:06:04.214 --> 00:06:05.619
When something happens to us,
当我们遭遇了一些事情的时候，

135
00:06:05.643 --> 00:06:08.723
we first decide, is this good or bad?
我们首先会思考，这是好事还是坏事？

136
00:06:08.747 --> 00:06:12.421
Is it fair or unfair, is it blameworthy, is it punishable?
这是公平的吗？ 是应该受到谴责和惩罚的吗？

137
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.628
That's primary appraisal, it's when you evaluate the event itself.
当你对这件事本身进行评估时， 这就是最原始的评估。

138
00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:19.065
We decide what it means in the context of our lives
我们基于人生的经历 去理解这件事情的意义，

139
00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.445
and once we've done that, we decide how bad it is.
并且只要我们完成这个过程， 就可以定义这件事情糟糕的程度。

140
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.198
That's secondary appraisal.
这是第二级的评估。

141
00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:26.284
We say, "Is this the worst thing that's ever happened,
我们在考虑，“这是 有史以来最糟糕的事情吗？

142
00:06:26.308 --> 00:06:27.908
or can I cope with this?
我可以应付得了吗？”

143
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:32.142
Now, to illustrate that, I want you to imagine you are driving somewhere.
为了说明这一点，我想让大家 想象一下你正在开车去某个地方。

144
00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:35.182
And before I go any further, I should tell you,
我要先提醒你，

145
00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:37.102
if I were an evil genius

146
00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:40.698
and I wanted to create a situation that was going to make you mad,

147
00:06:40.722 --> 00:06:43.160
that situation would look a lot like driving.

148
00:06:43.184 --> 00:06:44.179
(Laughter)
（笑声）

149
00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.361
It's true.
这是真的。

150
00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:47.552
You are, by definition, on your way somewhere,
按照假设，你在去某个地方的路上，

151
00:06:47.576 --> 00:06:52.153
so everything that happens -- traffic, other drivers, road construction --
所以在途中所发生的一切—— 堵车，其他司机，道路施工——

152
00:06:52.177 --> 00:06:54.325
it feels like it's blocking your goals.
都像是在阻碍你去往目的地。

153
00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.540
There are all these written and unwritten rules of the road,
在路上也有很多明文规定的 或者约定俗成的规矩，

154
00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:00.818
and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you,
但这些规则都经常 在你面前被其他人违反，

155
00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:02.357
usually without consequence.
违规后通常是没有后果的。

156
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:04.127
And who's violating those rules?
谁在违反规则呢？

157
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:06.746
Anonymous others, people you will never see again,
不知名的其他人， 你永远不会再见第二次的人，

158
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.905
making them a very easy target for your wrath.

159
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.707
(Laughter)
（笑声）

160
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:15.427
So you're driving somewhere, thus teed up to be angry,
所以，如果你正在开车 去某个地方，你会准备变得生气，

161
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:19.175
and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit.
并且在你前面的那个人的 速度远远低于限速。

162
00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:21.161
And it's frustrating
这很让人不满，

163
00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:24.136
because you can't really see why they're driving so slow.
因为你真的不理解 他们为什么开得这么慢。

164
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.478
That's primary appraisal.
这就是初始的评估。

165
00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:28.762
You've looked at this and you've said it's bad and it's blameworthy.
你关注到了这一件事，并且你已经 判断出了这是件坏事，值得被责备。

166
00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:31.387
But maybe you also decide it's not that big a deal.
但你也可能判断这不是那么严重。

167
00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:33.704
You're not in a hurry, doesn't matter.

168
00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:36.180
That's secondary appraisal -- you don't get angry.

169
00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:40.894
But now imagine you're on your way to a job interview.

170
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.024
What that person is doing, it hasn't changed, right?
那个人行为并没有发生变化，对吗？

171
00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:47.613
So primary appraisal doesn't change; still bad, still blameworthy.
所以初级评估并没有变化， 还是坏的，还是值得责备的。

172
00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:50.976
But your ability to cope with it sure does.
但是你去应对它的能力一定发生了变化。

173
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.363

you're going to be late to that job interview.

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:04.048
Somebody else is going to get your dream job

and you're going to be broke.

183
00:08:10.477 --> 00:08:12.635

"Because of this person in front of me.

187
00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:18.762

（笑声）

188

And this monster is here just to ruin your life.
而且这个怪兽的出现 就是为了毁掉你的生活。

189
00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:23.714
(Laughter)
（笑声）

190
00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:25.587
Now that thought process,

it's called catastrophizing, the one where we make the worst of things.
叫做灾难化，它是我们把事情 做到最糟糕的情况。

193
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.725
is associated with chronic anger.
主要思考方式之一。

194
00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:36.857
But there's a couple of others.
但还有其他几种类型。

195
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:38.445
Misattributing causation.
比如，错误归因：

196
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:41.246
Angry people tend to put blame where it doesn't belong.
愤怒的人们常常责备毫不相关的事情。

197
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.152
Not just on people,
不仅仅是针对人，

198
00:08:43.176 --> 00:08:45.064
but actually inanimate objects as well.
也针对无生命的物体上。

199
00:08:45.088 --> 00:08:46.977
And if you think that sound ridiculous,
如果你觉得这听起来很可笑，

200
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.724
think about the last time you lost your car keys and you said,

"Where did those car keys go?"

They tend to overgeneralize, they use words like "always,"

208
00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:09.969
Demandingness: they put their own needs ahead of the needs of others:
又比如，过度苛责：愤怒的人将他们 自己的需求放在他人需求之前：

209
00:09:09.993 --> 00:09:12.294
"I don't care why this person is driving so slow,
“我不关心这个人为什么开得这么慢，

210
00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:16.221
they need to speed up or move over so I can get to this job interview."
他需要加速或者挪开， 这样我就可以按时参加面试！”

211
00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:18.536
And finally, inflammatory labeling.

212
00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:21.967
They call people fools, idiots, monsters,
他们叫其他人傻子，蠢货，怪兽，

213
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:25.039
or a whole bunch of things I've been told I'm not allowed to say
或者一大堆今天在演讲中

214
00:09:24.123 --> 00:09:25.324
during this TED Talk.
我不能公开说的东西。

215
00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:26.975
(Laughter)
（笑声）

216
00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:28.969
So for a long time,
所以，在很长一段时间里，

217
00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:32.449
psychologists have referred to these as cognitive distortions
心理学家把这些称为认知扭曲，

218
00:09:32.473 --> 00:09:34.027
or even irrational beliefs.
或者甚至是不合逻辑的信念。

219
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.510
And yeah, sometimes they are irrational.

220
00:09:37.282 --> 00:09:39.004
Maybe even most of the time.
也许甚至是大多数时候。

221
00:09:39.028 --> 00:09:41.710
But sometimes, these thoughts are totally rational.

There are cruel, selfish people,
的确有残忍的，自私的人，

224
00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:49.817
and it's not only OK to be angry when we're treated poorly,

225
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:53.060
it's right to be angry when we're treated poorly.
更是正确的。

226
00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:57.667
If there's one thing I want you to remember from my talk today, it's this:

227
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:01.437
your anger exists in you as an emotion
你的愤怒作为一种情绪存在，

228
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:06.119
because it offered your ancestors, both human and nonhuman,

229
00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:08.210
with an evolutionary advantage.

230
00:10:08.677 --> 00:10:11.762
Just as your fear alerts you to danger,

231
00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:13.942
your anger alerts you to injustice.
你的愤怒让你对 不公正的情况保持警惕。

232
00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:16.524
It's one of the ways your brain communicates to you
这是你的大脑告诉你，

233
00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:18.215
that you have had enough.
你已经受够了的一种方式。

234
00:10:18.842 --> 00:10:22.236
What's more, it energizes you to confront that injustice.

235
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.466
Think for a second about the last time you got mad.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:35.157
otherwise known as your fight-or-flight system,

242
00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:45.919

243
00:10:45.943 --> 00:10:47.817

That's why your face went red.

246
00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:56.925
It's all part of this complex pattern of physiological experiences

247
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:58.187
that exist today
延续到了今天，

248
00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:00.969
because they helped your ancestors

249
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:04.326
deal with cruel and unforgiving forces of nature.

250
00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:08.027

251
00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:09.324
to deal with their anger,

00:11:09.348 --> 00:11:10.676
to physically fight,

253
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.857
they are no longer reasonable or appropriate.
这些现在都不再是 合理或者合适的表现。

You can't and you shouldn't swing a club every time you're provoked.
你不能而且也不应该在每一次 被挑衅的时候都强烈反击。

255
00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:19.524
(Laughter)
（笑声）

256
00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:21.286
But here's the good news.
但是好消息是，

257
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.734
You are capable of something

258

your nonhuman ancestors weren't capable of.

And that is the capacity to regulate your emotions.

260
00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:30.788
Even when you want to lash out,
就算你想要咆哮的时候，

261
00:11:30.812 --> 00:11:33.494
you can stop yourself and you can channel that anger

262
00:11:33.518 --> 00:11:35.585
into something more productive.
更有成效的东西。

263
00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:37.738
So often when we talk about anger,
所以当我们谈到愤怒的时候，

264
00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:40.429
we talk about how to keep from getting angry.
我们总是讲如何防止生气。

265
00:11:40.453 --> 00:11:42.984
We tell people to calm down or relax.

266

We even tell people to let it go.
我们甚至告诉他们要学会放手。

267
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:50.159
And all of that assumes that anger is bad and that it's wrong to feel it.
这些都建立在愤怒是不好的， 我们不应该去感受到它的假设上。

268
00:11:50.532 --> 00:11:53.353
But instead, I like to think of anger as a motivator.
其实不然，我倾向于 把愤怒想作一种动力。

269
00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:56.504
The same way your thirst motivates you to get a drink of water,
就像你觉得口渴 是你去喝水的动力，

270
00:11:56.528 --> 00:11:59.480
the same way your hunger motivates you to get a bite to eat,

your anger can motivate you to respond to injustice.
你的愤怒是你对 不正义做出反应的动力。

272
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:07.365
Because we don't have to think too hard to find things we should be mad about.
正因为我们不用太费神 去找到让我们生气的东西。

273
00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:09.517
When we go back to the beginning,
回到开始的话题，

274
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:13.511
yeah, some of those things, they're silly and not worth getting angry over.
的确，有些事情实在是太傻了， 不值得我们去生气。

275
00:12:13.535 --> 00:12:16.742
But racism, sexism, bullying, environmental destruction,
但是种族歧视，性别歧视， 霸凌，环境破坏，

276
00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:19.068
those things are real, those things are terrible,
这些事情是真实存在的， 也是是很可怕的，

277
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:22.292
and the only way to fix them is to get mad first
