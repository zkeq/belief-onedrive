I was really excited to go to this historic site,

because I understand and appreciate the power of place.

11

Now, Madison called his estate Montpelier.

And Montpelier is absolutely beautiful.

It's several thousand acres of rolling hills,

with absolutely breathtaking views of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

16
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.239
But it's a haunting beauty,

17
00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:08.833
because Montpelier was also a slave labor camp.

You see, James Madison enslaved more than 100 people

The centerpiece of Montpelier is Madison's mansion.

the director of education, Christian Cotz --

cool white dude --

32
00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.377
(Laughter)
(笑声)

33
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.821
took me almost immediately to the library.
马上就带我去了图书馆。

34
00:01:55.266 --> 00:02:02.904
And it was amazing, being able to stand in this place where such an important moment in American history happened.
能够站在这个见证了美国历史上如此重要时刻的地方，真是太棒了。

35
00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.503
But then after a little while there,

Christian actually took me downstairs to the cellars of the mansion.

Now, in the cellars of the mansion,

that's where the enslaved African Americans who managed the house spent most of their time.
是非裔美国人被奴役的地方，他们大半辈子都在打理宅邸的事务。

39
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:23.450

40
00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:25.620
And while we were there,

43
00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:35.516

45
00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:41.610
Now look,

00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:44.850
I was going to be staying on-site on this former slave plantation

00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:46.031
for a couple of days,

so I wasn't trying to upset any white people.

49
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.413
(Laughter)
(笑声)

50
00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:50.857
Because when this was over,

51
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:53.008
I wanted to make sure that I could get out.
我想确定我还能出去。

52
00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:55.826
(Laughter)
(笑声)

53
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.046
But as I'm actually sliding my hand along the cellar wall,
但当我真的用手沿着地窖的墙摸索，

54
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.516
I couldn't help but think about my daughters,
我忍不住想到了我的女儿,

55
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.176
and my youngest one in particular,
也是我最小的孩子，

56
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.739
who was only about two or three years old at the time,
当时她只有两三岁，

57
00:03:06.763 --> 00:03:09.000
because every time she hopped out of our car,

58
00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:12.135
she would take her hand and slide it along the outside,
都会伸出手，沿着车的外壳滑动，

59
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.175
which is absolutely disgusting.
这太不卫生了。

60
00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.556
And then --
然后,

61
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.207
and then, if I couldn't get to her in time,
如果我不能及时赶过去制止她，

62
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.716
she would take her fingers and pop them in her mouth,
她就会把脏兮兮的小手塞进嘴里，

63
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.564
which would drive me absolutely crazy.
于是我就彻底抓狂了。

64
00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:26.008
So this is what I'm thinking about while I'm supposed to be a historian.
然而作为一名历史学家，我当时想到的只有这些。

65
00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:27.333
(Laughter)
(笑声)

66
00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:32.752
But then, I actually do feel these impressions in the brick.
但是，我确实能感受到这些墙上的印痕。

67
00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:34.958
I feel these ridges in the brick.
我感受着砖上的这些隆起。

68
00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:38.617
And it takes a second to realize what they are.
我们需要花一点时间去了解它们是什么。

69
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:42.236
What they are are tiny hand prints.
它们实际上，是小小的手印。

70
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.723
Because all of the bricks at James Madison's estate
因为詹姆斯·麦迪逊庄园中的所有砖块

71
00:03:47.747 --> 00:03:51.224
were made by the children that he enslaved.

72
00:03:52.193 --> 00:03:54.082
And that's when it hit me
就在那时，我突然意识到

73
00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:55.693
that the library
那座图书馆，

74
00:03:55.717 --> 00:04:01.637
in which James Madison conceives and conceptualizes the Bill of Rights
詹姆斯·麦迪逊构思并使《人权法案》概念化的地方，

75
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:08.056
rests on a foundation of bricks made by the children that he enslaved.
是由他所奴役的孩子们所制造的砖块搭建起来的。

76
00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:12.055
And this is hard history.
这是一段沉重的历史。

77
00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:18.182
It's hard history, because it's difficult to imagine the kind of inhumanity
这段历史很沉重, 因为我们难以想象这种不人道的程度：

78
00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.223
that leads one to enslave children
奴役儿童

79
00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:23.046
to make bricks for your comfort and convenience.
来制造砖块，为自己提供舒适和方便。

80
00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:24.569
It's hard history,
这段历史很沉重,

81
00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:28.557
because it's hard to talk about the violence of slavery,

82
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:31.013
the beatings, the whippings, the kidnappings,
那些殴打、鞭打、绑架,

83
00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.544
the forced family separations.

84
00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:38.223
It's hard history, because it's hard to teach white supremacy,
这是沉重的历史，因为很难教授白人至上主义者，

85
00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:41.397
which is the ideology that justified slavery.
这是一种为奴隶制辩护的意识形态。

86
00:04:41.977 --> 00:04:45.691
And so rather than confront hard history,
于是与其直面沉重的历史，

87
00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:48.030
we tend to avoid it.
我们倾向于逃避它。

88
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:53.600
Now, sometimes that means just making stuff up.
有时候，这意味着篡改历史。

89
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.426
I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say

90
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.179
that "states' rights" was the primary cause of the Civil War.
“州的权利”是内战爆发的首要原因。

91
00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:05.775
That would actually come as a surprise to the people who fought in the Civil War.
这会让那些参加过内战的人感到非常诧异。

92
00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:07.132
(Laughter)
(笑声)

93
00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:12.224
Sometimes, we try to rationalize hard history.
有时候，我们试着为沉重的历史寻找理由。

94
00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.542
When people visit Montpelier --

and by "people," in this instance, I mean white people --

102

There is only worse and worser.

103
00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:38.273
And sometimes,
有时,

104
00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:41.264
we just pretend the past didn't happen.

for 50 years after the American Revolution.

112
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.583

Because, inherent in this statement,

is the notion that at some point,

19 世纪 70 年代，我的曾祖父也出生于佐治亚州贾斯珀县，

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.805
and he actually managed to accumulate a fair bit of land.

144
00:08:07.368 --> 00:08:11.757

And then Jim Crow took his life.

My grandfather, Leonard Jeffries Senior,

was born in Georgia,

148
00:08:19.238 --> 00:08:21.198
but there was nothing left for him there,
但没有任何遗产可以继承，

149
00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:24.239
so he actually grew up in Newark, New Jersey.
于是他小时候就搬去了新泽西的纽瓦克市。

150
00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:28.120
And he spent most of his life working as a custodian.

151
00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:33.707
Job discrimination, segregated education and redlining

kept him from ever breaking into the middle class.

nothing more than a life-insurance policy

that was barely enough to cover his funeral expenses.

Now my parents, both social workers,

158
00:08:53.805 --> 00:09:03.093

Now Crown Heights, at the time, was an all-Black neighborhood,
皇冠高地在当时是一个全黑人社区，

160
00:09:06.723 --> 00:09:08.191
and it was kind of rough.

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:13.488
My brother and I often went to sleep, by the mid-1980s, hearing gunshots.
我和哥哥常常都是伴着枪声入睡的，这种情况一直持续到 1980 年代中期。

162

And they're still there.

they went to sleep one night in an all-Black neighborhood,

170

(Laughter)

171
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.659
And as a result of gentrification,

172
00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:47.332
not only did all their neighbors mysteriously disappear,

but the value of their home skyrocketed.

174
00:09:54.286 --> 00:09:57.580

175
00:09:57.604 --> 00:10:00.310
at 29 percent interest, by the way --

that home is now worth 30 times what they paid it for.

Do the math with me.

180
00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:12.032
That's a lot of money.

181
00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:14.103
(Laughter)
(笑声)

182
00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:16.683
So that means,

as their single and sole asset,

184
00:10:19.143 --> 00:10:24.009
when the time comes for them to pass that asset on to my brother and I,

my concern about not remembering it
