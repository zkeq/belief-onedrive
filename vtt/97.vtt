1
00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.726
I want to talk to you about how to build and rebuild trust,
我想跟大家谈谈 如何建立和重建信任，

2
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.519
because it's my belief that trust
因为我相信：信任

3
00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:24.469
is the foundation for everything we do,
是我们做一切事情的基础，

4
00:00:24.493 --> 00:00:28.922
and that if we can learn to trust one another more,
如果我们学着彼此之间多一些信任，

5
00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.040
we can have unprecedented human progress.
人类将能取得前所未有的进步。

6
00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:36.919
But what if trust is broken?
可如果人与人间信任破裂了呢？

7
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:43.454
What if your CEO is caught on video, disparaging an employee?
假如你的CEO被拍到在贬低一名员工；

8
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:52.212
What if your employees experience a culture of bias, exclusion and worse?
假如你的员工感受到的是一种 充满偏见、排挤或更糟糕的企业文化；

9
00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.744
What if there's a data breach,
假如发生了数据泄露，

10
00:00:55.768 --> 00:01:01.014
and it feels an awful lot like a cover-up than seriously addressing it?
但相应的处理更像在掩盖， 而不是认真想法解决；

11
00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.501
And most tragically,
而最不幸的是，

12
00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:09.279
what if a technological fail leads to the loss of human life?
假如技术上的失误最终致人死亡， 当上述情况发生，该怎么办？

13
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.132
If I was giving this talk six months ago,
如果我是六个月前做这个演讲，

14
00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.664
I would have been wearing an Uber T-shirt.
我可能会穿着 优步（Uber）T恤站在这。

15
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.567
I'm a Harvard Business School professor,
我是哈佛商学院的教授，

16
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:25.315
but I was super attracted to going to an organization
不过我超级想去一个组织，

17
00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:30.638
that was metaphorically and perhaps quite literally on fire.
可以比喻成，或许真的是 一个如火中烧的组织。

18
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.010
I had read everything that was written in the newspaper,
我读了所有的纸媒报道，

19
00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:39.121
and that was precisely what drew me to the organization.
正是那些报道驱使我来到这个组织。

20
00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:42.686
This was an organization that had lost trust
这是一个已经失去了

21
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.997
with every constituent that mattered.
所有重要成员信任的组织。

22
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.970
But there's a word about me that I should share.
不过关于我自己， 有一个词必须得分享。

23
00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:52.462
My favorite trait is redemption.
我最喜欢的个人特质是拯救。

24
00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:58.795
I believe that there is a better version of us around every corner,
我相信，在每一个转角， 我们都能遇见更好的自己，

25
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.658
and I have seen firsthand
我也曾亲眼目睹

26
00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:03.360
how organizations and communities
机构、团体，

27
00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:06.575
and individuals change at breathtaking speed.
以及个人如何以惊人的速度改变。

28
00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:12.517
I went to Uber with the hopes that a turnaround there
我满怀期待来到优步， 希望优步能扭转现状，

29
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.123
could give license to the rest of us
得以缩小我们这些人

30
00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:18.806
who might have narrower versions of their challenges.
可能面临的挑战范围。

31
00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:24.596
But when I got to Uber, I made a really big mistake.
但到优步后， 我犯了一个大错误。

32
00:02:26.163 --> 00:02:31.440
I publicly committed to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day
我公开承诺每天穿优步T恤，

33
00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:34.598
until every other employee was wearing an Uber T-shirt.
直到所有员工都穿上为止。

34
00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.858
I had clearly not thought that through.
很显然我太冲动了。

35
00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:40.530
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:44.963
It was 250 days of wearing an Uber T-shirt.
足足穿了 250 天优步T恤。

37
00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.318
Now I am liberated from that commitment,
现在我从那个承诺中解脱了，

38
00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.541
as I am back at HBS,
因为我又回到了哈佛商学院，

39
00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:56.750
and what I'd like to do is share with you
而我想跟各位分享的是

40
00:02:56.774 --> 00:03:00.875
how far I have taken that liberty,
我带着这份自由走了多远，

41
00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.994
which, it's baby steps,
嗯，也就刚迈出几步吧，

42
00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:05.288
(Laughter)
（笑声）

43
00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:07.279
but I would just say I'm on my way.
不过我只想说， 我总算恢复自由身了。

44
00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:09.019
(Laughter)
（笑声）

45
00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:12.607
Now, trust, if we're going to rebuild it,
现在来看信任， 如果我们想重建它，

46
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:15.247
we have to understand its component parts.
我们得了解它的构成。

47
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.568
The component parts of trust are super well understood.
非常好理解。

48
00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:22.282
There's three things about trust.
信任由三部分构成。

49
00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.553
If you sense that I am being authentic,
第一，真实性。 如果你察觉到我是真实的，

50
00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:30.819
you are much more likely to trust me.
你就会更容易信任我。

51
00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:37.515
If you sense that I have real rigor in my logic,
第二，逻辑。 如果你认为我的逻辑确实合理,

52
00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.681
you are far more likely to trust me.
你就会更容易信任我。

53
00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:45.261
And if you believe that my empathy is directed towards you,
第三，同理心。 如果你相信我和你有共鸣，

54
00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:47.512
you are far more likely to trust me.
你就会更容易信任我。

55
00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:50.924
When all three of these things are working,
当三部分都状态正常，

56
00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:53.067
we have great trust.
人与人之间会建立很深的信任。

57
00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:57.359
But if any one of these three gets shaky,
但假如其中任何一部分不稳固，

58
00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:01.008
if any one of these three wobbles,
任何一部分松动了，

59
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.468
trust is threatened.
信任就会受到威胁。

60
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:05.867
Now here's what I'd like to do.
接下来就是我想做的。

61
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:11.048
I want each of us to be able to engender more trust tomorrow,
我想让每一个人明天，

62
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:13.694
literally tomorrow, than we do today.
没错，就是明天， 都能比今天创造更多信任。

63
00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.978
And the way to do that is to understand where trust wobbles for ourselves
做法就是弄清自己的 信任三角哪里出现了松动，

64
00:04:20.942 --> 00:04:23.684
and have a ready-made prescription to overcome it.
再拿出实用的对策去解决它。

65
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.470
So that's what I would like to do together.
这正是我想和大家一起做的。

66
00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:31.756
Would you give me some sense of whether or not you're here voluntarily?
方便让我知道下， 你们是自愿来这儿的吗？

67
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.867
(Laughter)
（笑声）

68
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.255
Yeah. OK. Alright. Awesome.
哇哦，好，不错，非常好。

69
00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.789
OK. So --
所以，你们——

70
00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:38.153
(Laughter)
（笑声）

71
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.943
it's just super helpful feedback.
你们的反馈太给力了。

72
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.253
(Laughter)
（笑声）

73
00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:47.332
So the most common wobble is empathy.
那么，最常见的是同理心的松动。

74
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.206
The most common wobble
这种最常见的松动

75
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.212
is that people just don't believe that we're mostly in it for them,
是指人们总不相信 我们通常是跟他们站在一边的，

76
00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:58.408
and they believe that we're too self-distracted.
他们认为我们总是被自己扰乱。

77
00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:00.801
And it's no wonder.
这不奇怪。

78
00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:04.433
We are all so busy with so many demands on our time,
我们终日奔忙，分秒必争，

79
00:05:04.457 --> 00:05:08.154
it's easy to crowd out the time and space
很容易就挤掉同理心所需要的

80
00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:09.349
that empathy requires.
时间和空间。

81
00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:13.639
For Dylan to be Dylan, that takes real time.
迪伦成为迪伦需要花费时间，

82
00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:20.262
And for us, if we have too much to do, we may not have that time.
而如果我们有太多事要忙， 我们可能就没有那个时间。

83
00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.785
But that puts us into a vicious cycle,
但那会令我们陷入一个恶性循环，

84
00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:25.555
because without revealing empathy,
因为没有表现出同理心，

85
00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.794
it makes everything harder.
每件事都更困难。

86
00:05:27.818 --> 00:05:31.485
Without the benefit of the doubt of trust, it makes everything harder,
没有了“暂且信任你”， 每件事都更困难，

87
00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.318
and then we have less and less time for empathy, and so it goes.
然后留给同理心的时间 就愈发减少，这样周而复始。

88
00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:37.540
So here's the prescription:
怎么办，方法在这里：

89
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.171
identify where, when and to whom
确定在何时、何地、对谁

90
00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:48.635
you are likely to offer your distraction.
你想要匀出自己的部分精力。

91
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.069
That should trace pretty perfectly
那一定能非常精确地跟踪到

92
00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:59.529
to when, where and to whom you are likely to withhold your empathy.
你可能会在何时、何地、对谁 隐藏自己的同理心。

93
00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:03.544
And if in those instances,
一旦遇到这些情况， 采用这个方法，

94
00:06:03.568 --> 00:06:09.813
we can come up with a trigger that gets us to look up,
我们就会像碰到触发器一样， 它促使我们抬起头，

95
00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:12.960
look at the people right in front of us,
看看面前的人，

96
00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:14.793
listen to them,
听听他们在说什么，

97
00:06:14.817 --> 00:06:18.957
deeply immerse ourselves in their perspectives,
认真换位思考，

98
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:23.934
then we have a chance of having a sturdy leg of empathy.
这样我们就能获得信任三角中 牢固的一边：同理心。

99
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:26.456
And if you do nothing else,
如果你做不了别的，

100
00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:30.985
please put away your cell phone.
那请先把手机收起来。

101
00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:36.596
It is the largest distraction magnet yet to be made,
手机是迄今为止制造出来的 最会使人们分心的东西，

102
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.125
and it is super difficult to create empathy and trust in its presence.
它的存在使得同理心 和信任的产生异常困难。

103
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.071
That takes care of the empathy wobblers.
它控制住了那些同理心松动的人。

104
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.151
Logic wobbles can come in two forms.
逻辑松动有两种形式：

105
00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.043
It's either the quality of your logic
一种体现在逻辑能力上，

106
00:06:56.572 --> 00:06:59.789
or it's your ability to communicate the logic.
另一种体现在表达逻辑的能力上。

107
00:07:00.597 --> 00:07:04.303
Now if the quality of your logic is at risk,
如果你的逻辑能力不行，

108
00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:05.955
I can't really help you with that.
那我真的无能为力。

109
00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.318
(Laughter)
（笑声）

110
00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:08.987
It's like, not in this much time.
至少在这么短时间内不行。

111
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:12.474
(Laughter)
（笑声）

112
00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:17.578
But fortunately, it's often the case that our logic is sound,
不过幸运的是， 通常我们的逻辑都是正常的，

113
00:07:17.602 --> 00:07:23.091
but it's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeopardy.
但是表达逻辑的能力有问题。

114
00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:26.693
Super fortunately, there's a very easy fix to this.
万幸的是， 这有一个简单的解决方法。

115
00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:33.463
If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world,
如果我们认为世界上有两种表达方式，

116
00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:36.630
and Harvard Business School professors are known for two-by-twos --
而哈佛商学院教授 以2乘2方式闻名——

117
00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:39.122
nonsense, it's the triangle that rocks.
瞎说，三角形才是最棒的。

118
00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.302
(Laughter)
（笑声）

119
00:07:42.657 --> 00:07:46.832
If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world,
如果我们认为世界上 有两种表达方式，

120
00:07:46.856 --> 00:07:51.470
and the first one is when you take us on a journey,
第一种就像你带我们去旅行，

121
00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:56.477
a magnificent journey that has twists and turns
一次华丽的旅行， 沿途有盘旋，有转弯

122
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:59.633
and mystery and drama,
有神秘莫测，有戏剧性的转变，

123
00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:02.144
until you ultimately get to the point,
终于你言归正传了，

124
00:08:03.356 --> 00:08:06.432
and some of the best communicators in the world
世界上一些最棒的交流者，

125
00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:08.487
communicate just like this.
就是这样与人交流的。

126
00:08:09.252 --> 00:08:11.784
But if you have a logic wobble,
可如果你有逻辑松动，

127
00:08:11.808 --> 00:08:13.990
this can be super dangerous.
这样做就非常危险。

128
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.956
So instead, I implore you,
所以，相反，我恳请各位，

129
00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:24.899
start with your point in a crisp half-sentence,
一开始你就要用 干脆利落的半句话点明主题，

130
00:08:24.923 --> 00:08:27.899
and then give your supporting evidence.
接着再给出你的支持证据。

131
00:08:29.597 --> 00:08:32.014
This means that people will be able to get access
这样做意味着别人能够接触到

132
00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:34.231
to our awesome ideas,
我们那些超棒的点子，

133
00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:35.897
and just as importantly,
同样重要的是，

134
00:08:37.405 --> 00:08:40.047
if you get cut off before you're done ...
即使在结束前就被打断——

135
00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:43.212
ladies --
就像这样，女士们 （没说先生们）——

136
00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:45.761
(Laughter)
（笑声）

137
00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:52.590
(Applause)
（鼓掌）

138
00:08:52.614 --> 00:08:56.037
If you get cut off before you're done,
即使还没结束你就被打断，

139
00:08:56.061 --> 00:08:57.980
you still get credit for the idea,
你仍会因为这个点子得到称赞，

140
00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:01.555
as opposed to someone else coming in and snatching it from you.
而不是有哪个人突然闯进来 抢走你的这个点子。

141
00:09:01.585 --> 00:09:08.155
(Applause)
（鼓掌）

142
00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:09.513
You just gave me goosebumps.
你们让我有点受宠若惊。

143
00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:11.013
(Laughter)
（笑声）

144
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.089
The third wobble is authenticity, and I find it to be the most vexing.
第三种是真实性出现松动， 我发现这是最让人头疼的。

145
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.924
We as a human species can sniff out in a moment,

Great.

And that is super easy to do

when you're around people who are like you.

154
00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:55.026
the prescription to "be you" can be super challenging.

we're less likely to be trusted.

当我来到优步时， 它到处都在动荡不安。

同理心、逻辑、真实性 都在疯狂动摇。

不过对其中两种松动， 我们有能力找到极其快速有效的对策。

I'll give you an illustration of empathy.
先来说下同理心。

199
00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.417
In the meetings at Uber,

It may have done many things,

206
00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:55.061
but it did not create a safe, empathetic environment.

207
00:12:55.432 --> 00:12:57.836

technology, off and away.
关掉手机，远离科技。

209
00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:03.388
And that forced people to look up,

and to collaborate in unprecedented ways.

215
00:13:18.593 --> 00:13:21.490
and this was because the hypergrowth of the organization

216

meant that people, managers were getting promoted

217
00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:26.343
again and again and again.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.150
The solution: a massive influx of executive education

222
00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:44.832

on strategy and leadership.

It gave people the rigor of the quality of their logic,

225

and it turned a whole lot of triangles, right-side up,

226
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:59.820
so people were able to communicate effectively with one another.
这样人们就有能力实现 彼此间的有效沟通。

227
00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:05.913
The last one, authenticity, I'll say it's still mighty wobbly,
最后一个，真实性， 我会说这部分还是松动的很厉害。

228
00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:09.462
but honestly, that doesn't make Uber very different

from all of the other companies I've seen in Silicon Valley and beyond.
与我见过的硅谷和硅谷之外的 其他公司产生太大差别。

It is still much easier to coach people to fit in.
相比之下，指导人们 去调整适应还是更容易些。

when they say something that you were going to say,
你去奖励他们，

233
00:14:26.961 --> 00:14:29.493
as opposed to rewarding people when they say something

entirely different than what you were going to say.
