﻿1
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.476
I don't come to you today as an expert.
今天我并非以一个 专家的身份来这里演讲，

2
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.436
I come to you as someone who has been really interested
我是为了那些一直非常想要

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.516
in how I get better at what I do
在自己的领域成为行家的人

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.780
and how we all do.
而来。

5
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.876
I think it's not just how good you are now,
我想，重要的不是现在你有多优秀，

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.780
I think it's how good you're going to be that really matters.
而是未来你将多精彩。

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.436
I was visiting this birth center in the north of India.
我曾经到访印度北边的 这个生育中心。

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.596
I was watching the birth attendants,
我看着这些产护人员，

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.516
and I realized I was witnessing in them an extreme form of this very struggle,
发现她们正在与复杂的局面

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.636
which is how people improve in the face of complexity --
进行艰苦的斗争——

11
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.860
or don't.
当然，也许是我多虑了。

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.556
The women here are delivering in a region
但在当地生育中心

13
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.900
where the typical birth center has a one-in-20 death rate for the babies,
出生的婴儿，死亡率高达5%，

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.660
and the moms are dying at a rate ten times higher than they do elsewhere.
孕妇的死亡率也是其他地区的十倍。

15
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.076
Now, we've known the critical practices
现在，我们已经知道降低几十年来

16
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.620
that stop the big killers in birth for decades,
新生儿死亡率居高不下的关键举措，

17
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.436
and the thing about it is that even in this place --
以及造成这一现象的原因——

18
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.876
in this place especially,
像这种地方，

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.660
the simplest things are not simple.
稀松小事也可以举步维艰。

20
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.139
We know for example you should wash hands and put on clean gloves,
众所周知，产护人员应该 洗手后戴上干净的手套，

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.396
but here,
然而在这里，

22
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.420
the tap is in another room,
手术室没有水龙头

23
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.900
and they don't have clean gloves.
产护人员也没有干净的手套。

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.756
To reuse their gloves,
为了重复利用手套

25
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.540
they wash them in this basin of dilute bleach,
她们用稀释的漂白水清洗手套，

26
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.180
but you can see there's still blood on the gloves from the last delivery.
但手套上仍有之前使用留下的血迹。

27
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.140
Ten percent of babies are born with difficulty breathing everywhere.
世界上10%的孩子出生时就 伴有呼吸困难的症状。

28
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.516
We know what to do.
人们知道如何解决这一问题。

29
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.100
You dry the baby with a clean cloth to stimulate them to breathe.
用干净的毛巾轻抚婴儿 以刺激他们呼吸。

30
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.436
If they don't start to breathe,
如果没有作用，

31
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.356
you suction out their airways.
应疏通他们的呼吸道。

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.316
And if that doesn't work, you give them breaths with the baby mask.
如果效果仍然不明显， 应该给他们戴上婴儿（氧气）面罩。

33
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.596
But these are skills that they've learned mostly from textbooks,
这些是学校教授的方法，

34
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.940
and that baby mask is broken.
然而在这儿，婴儿面罩 根本无法使用。

35
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.796
In this one disturbing image for me
这一幕给我留下了深刻的印象，

36
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.940
is a picture that brings home just how dire the situation is.
不断提醒着我，情况实在太糟糕了。

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.196
This is a baby 10 minutes after birth,

38
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.420
and he's alive,

39
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.060
but only just.
但是仅仅活着。

40
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.356
No clean cloth,

has not been dried,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.060
not warming skin to skin,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.420
an unsterile clamp across the cord.
只有一个未经消毒的夹子夹着脐带。

44
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.756

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.420
and he's losing his temperature by the minute.

46
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.076
Successful child delivery requires a successful team of people.
每一个婴儿的顺利出生， 背后都少不了一个出色的团队。

47
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.316
A whole team has to be skilled and coordinated;
由技艺高超且配合默契的 成员组成的团队，

the nurses who do the deliveries in a place like this,

49
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.996
the doctor who backs them up,

The thing is they are all experienced professionals.

55
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.380
I didn't meet anybody who hadn't been part of thousands of deliveries.
每个人都参与过上千次的接生。

56
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.876

57
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.940
they seem to be at their limits.
却变得束手无策。

58
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.540
They were not getting better anymore.
他们已经尽力做到最好了。

59
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.620
It's how good you're going to be that really matters.
但关键在于，未来 他们能否改变这一现状。

60
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.540
It presses on a fundamental question.
由此延伸出一个基本的问题。

61
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.140
How do professionals get better at what they do?

How do they get great?

63
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.676
And there are two views about this.
关于此问题有两类观点。

64
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.700
One is the traditional pedagogical view.
一类是传统的教学观点。

65
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.996
That is that you go to school,
去学校学习，

66
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.696
you study, you practice, you learn, you graduate,
上课，做功课，考试，毕业，

67
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.316
and then you go out into the world
然后走向社会，

68
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.996
and you make your way on your own.
独自前行。

69
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.180
A professional is someone who is capable of managing their own improvement.
成为一个能自我管理， 不断进步的专家。

70
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.156
That is the approach that virtually all professionals have learned by.
这几乎是所有专业人士学习的方法。

71
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.436
That's how doctors learn,
是医生学习的方法，

72
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.876
that's how lawyers do,
是律师学习的方法，

73
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.180
scientists ...
是科学家学习的方法，

74
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.540
musicians.
也是音乐家学习的方法.....

75
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.156
And the thing is, it works.
并且这个方法效果显著。

76
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.356
Consider for example legendary Juilliard violin instructor Dorothy DeLay.
比如朱利亚音乐学院的 传奇教师多萝西·迪蕾（Dorothy DeLay）。

77
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.076
She trained an amazing roster of violin virtuosos:
她培养了一大批杰出的小提琴演奏家：

78
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.636
Midori, Sarah Chang, Itzhak Perlman.
美岛莉， 张莎拉，伊扎克·帕尔曼等。

79
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.796
Each of them came to her as young talents,
他们拜入她门下时都已锋芒毕露，

80
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.899
and they worked with her over years.
经历数年的练习后， 最终达到了很高的水准。

81
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.116
What she worked on most, she said,
她说，她最大的贡献是

82
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.676
was inculcating in them habits of thinking and of learning
培养了他们思考和学习的习惯，

83
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.436
so that they could make their way in the world without her
当他们毕业后

84
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.660
when they were done.
可以独自走好以后的路。

85
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.060
Now, the contrasting view comes out of sports.
另一类观点来自运动项目。

86
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.740
And they say "You are never done,
教练往往说：“你们还差的远呢！”

87
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.556
everybody needs a coach."
每个运动员都需要一个教练。

88
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.780
Everyone.
是的，每一个。

89
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.180
The greatest in the world needs a coach.
即使是世界上最杰出的运动员。

90
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.260
So I tried to think about this as a surgeon.
我试着用一名外科医生的 思维来考虑这一观点。

91
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.916
Pay someone to come into my operating room,
请一个人来手术室，

92
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.020
observe me and critique me.
对我进行观察及评判。

93
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.140
That seems absurd.
这听起来很可笑。

94
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.140
Expertise means not needing to be coached.
因为专业技能意味着 不需要再被训练。

95
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.250
So then which view is right?
那么，哪一个观点是正确的呢？

96
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.620
I learned that coaching came into sports as a very American idea.
我了解到，教练模式源于美国。

97
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.236
In 1875,
1875年，

98
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.636
Harvard and Yale played one of the very first American-rules football games.

99
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.500
Yale hired a head coach;
耶鲁聘请了一位主教练。

100
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.620
Harvard did not.
然而哈佛没有这样做。

101
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.436
The results?
至于结果？

102
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.996
Over the next three decades,
在之后30年的比赛里，

103
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.140
Harvard won just four times.
哈佛只赢了四场。

104
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.116
Harvard hired a coach.
后来哈佛不得不也聘请教练。

105
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.916
(Laughter)
（笑声）

106
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.900
And it became the way that sports works.
之后聘请教练成了体育界的标配。

107
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.316
But is it necessary then?
但教练真的这么有用吗？

108
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.780
Does it transfer into other fields?
这一模式有没有进入其它领域？

109
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.396
I decided to ask, of all people,
我决定请教一下他人，

110
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.660
Itzhak Perlman.
伊扎克·帕尔曼。

111
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.116
He had trained the Dorothy DeLay way
他按照多萝西·迪蕾的方式练习，

112
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.380
and became arguably the greatest violinist of his generation.
成为了同时代最杰出的小提琴家。

113
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.036
One of the beautiful things about getting to write for "The New Yorker"
为《纽约客》写文章的 一个美妙之处在于，

114
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.830
is I call people up, and they return my phone calls.
我给人们打电话，他们都会回我电话。

115
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.436
(Laughter)
（笑声）

116
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.156
And Perlman returned my phone call.
伊扎克·帕尔曼回了我的电话。

117
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.657
So we ended up having an almost two-hour conversation
围绕着他如何取得如此成就，

118
00:06:25.681 --> 00:06:29.161
about how he got to where he got in his career.
我们进行了两个小时的长谈。

119
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.140
And I asked him, I said, "Why don't violinists have coaches?"
我问他：为什么小提琴家没有教练？

120
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.116
And he said, "I don't know,
他回道：我不知道别人有没有，

121
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.660
but I always had a coach."
但是我一直都有。”

122
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.636
"You always had a coach?"
“你有教练？”

123
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.820
"Oh yeah, my wife, Toby."
“对，就是我的爱人托比。”

124
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.476
They had graduated together from Juilliard,
他们一起从朱丽亚音乐学院毕业，

125
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.036
and she had given up her job as a concert violinist

126
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.616
to be his coach,

127
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.916
sitting in the audience,

128
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.316
observing him and giving him feedback.

129
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.236
"Itzhak, in that middle section,
“伊扎克，中间那部分

130
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.420
you know you sounded a little bit mechanical.
听起来没有灵气。

131
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.840
What can you differently next time?"
下次你会进行不同的处理吗？”

132
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.220
It was crucial to everything he became, he said.
这对他如今取得的成就 至关重要，他说。

133
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.900
Turns out there are numerous problems in making it on your own.
当你独自一人时，会面对很多问题。

134
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.196
You don't recognize the issues that are standing in your way
你意识不到自身的问题，

135
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.436
or if you do,
即使你意识到了，

136
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.596
you don't necessarily know how to fix them.
也可能不知道怎么改正。

137
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.756
And the result is that somewhere along the way,
一路走来，你所面临的就是

138
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.380
you stop improving.
自己的能力开始停滞不前了。

139
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.916
And I thought about that,
这使我陷入沉思，

140
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.580
and I realized that was exactly what had happened to me as a surgeon.
意识到这正是出现在我身上的问题。

141
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.836
I'd entered practice in 2003,
我从03年开始从医，

142
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.436
and for the first several years,
在最初的若干年中，

143
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.836
it was just this steady, upward improvement in my learning curve.
我的学习曲线在稳步改善。

144
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.956
I watched my complication rates drop from one year to the next.
术后并发症逐年下降。

145
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.716
And after about five years,
之后五年，

146
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.940
they leveled out.
这一数字不再变化了。

147
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.516
And a few more years after that,
再往后几年，

148
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.300
I realized I wasn't getting any better anymore.
我基本上是在原地踏步。

149
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.740
And I thought: "Is this as good as I'm going to get?"
我不禁暗想：“难道 我的能力已经达到顶峰了吗？”

150
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.100
So I thought a little more and I said ...
再次忖度后，自言自语地说，

151
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.260
"OK,
“好吧，

152
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.100
I'll try a coach."
我要需要一个教练。”

153
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.316
So I asked a former professor of mine who had retired,
于是我邀请了教过我的 已退休教授，

154
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.156
his name is Bob Osteen,
鲍勃 · 欧斯丁，

155
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.036
and he agreed to come to my operating room
他答应了我的请求，

156
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.260
and observe me.
到手术室来观察我。

157
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.316
The case --
那次手术——

158
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.676
I remember that first case.
我清晰地记得，

159
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.156
It went beautifully.
手术堪称完美。

160
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.036
I didn't think there would be anything much he'd have to say
手术结束后，

161
00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:26.840
when we were done.
我以为他没什么好说的。

162
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.116
Instead, he had a whole page dense with notes.
结果，他写了满满一页的笔记。

163
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.956
(Laughter)
（笑声）

164
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.556
"Just small things," he said.
“都是些小问题，”他说。

165
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.676
(Laughter)
（笑声）

166
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.620
But it's the small things that matter.
但是细节决定成败。

167
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.236
"Did you notice that the light had swung out of the wound
“在手术中，你注意到 光源没有很好地

168
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.636
during the case?
对着伤口了吗？

169
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.396
You spent about half an hour
这半个小时的手术

170
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.780
just operating off the light from reflected surfaces."
都是在光照不足的情况下进行的。”

171
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.436
"Another thing I noticed," he said,
“另一件事是，”他说，

172
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.756
"Your elbow goes up in the air every once in a while.
你会不时地抬起你的手肘。

173
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.436
That means you're not in full control.
这说明你有些地方不受控制。

174
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.476
A surgeon's elbows should be down at their sides resting comfortably.
手术时手肘应该自然的下垂。

175
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.076
So that means if you feel your elbow going in the air,
以后你感觉手肘抬起时，

176
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.340
you should get a different instrument, or just move your feet."
应该换一个更称手的器械， 或者调整一下站姿。”

177
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.780
It was a whole other level of awareness.
这席话让我醍醐灌顶。

178
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.820
And I had to think,
我不得不思考，

179
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.900
you know, there was something fundamentally profound about this.
这背后一定有着更深的意义。

180
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.716
He was describing what great coaches do,
他不愧为一个出色的教练，

181
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.756
and what they do is they are your external eyes and ears,
因为出色的教练就是 充当你的第三只眼睛和耳朵，

182
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.180
providing a more accurate picture of your reality.
为你的状态提供一个更真实的描述。

183
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.860
They're recognizing the fundamentals.
他们更注重细节。

184
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.796
They're breaking your actions down
他们会细致地剖析你的行为，

185
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.220
and then helping you build them back up again.
并帮你建立正确的习惯。

186
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.636
After two months of coaching,
经历两个月的训练后，

187
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.900
I felt myself getting better again.
我犹如脱胎换骨。

188
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.676
And after a year,

I saw my complications drop down even further.

190
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.700
It was painful.

191
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.796
I didn't like being observed,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.876
and at times I didn't want to have to work on things.

193
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.460
I also felt there were periods where I would get worse before I got better.

194
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.356

195
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.980
that the coaches were onto something profoundly important.

196
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.756
In my other work,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.316
I lead a health systems innovation center called Ariadne Labs,

As part of it,

to devise a safe childbirth checklist.

And we knew

211
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.676
that just handing out a checklist wasn't going to change very much,
仅仅制定出检查表， 效果并不会有太大的改观，

212
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.916
and even just teaching it in the classroom wasn't necessarily going to be enough
甚至在学校里着重强调这些内容，

213
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.956
to get people to make the changes that you needed to bring it alive.
也不一定能有多少效果。

214
