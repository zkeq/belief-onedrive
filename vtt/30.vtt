4
00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:22.303
CA: So. most of us have this mental model in biology
[AI] CA:那么。我们大多数人在生物学上都有这种思维模式

5
00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:26.586
that DNA is a property of every living thing.
[AI] DNA是所有生物的属性。

6
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:32.021
that it is kind of the software that builds the hardware of our body.

7
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.132
That's how a lot of us think about this.

8
00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:37.399
That model leaves too many deep mysteries.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.838
I'd like to give you another perspective on this problem.
[AI] 我想就这个问题给你们另一个观点。

13
00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:52.350
One of the things that DNA does is specify the hardware of each cell.
[AI] DNA所做的事情之一就是指定每个细胞的硬件。

14
00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:56.694
So the DNA tells every cell what proteins it's supposed to have.
[AI] 所以DNA告诉每个细胞它应该有什么蛋白质。

15
00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.542
And so when you have tadpoles. for example.
[AI] 所以当你有蝌蚪的时候。例如

16
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.880
you see the kind of thing
[AI] 你看到了吗

17
00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:06.596
that most people think is sort of a progressive unrolling of the genome.
[AI] 大多数人认为这是一种基因组的逐步展开。

18
00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.592
Specific genes turn on and off.

20
00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:12.377
has to rearrange its face.

[AI] 所以眼睛。鼻孔。下巴——一切都得动。

22
00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:17.841
And one way to think about it used to be that. well.
[AI] 过去有一种想法是这样的。好

23
00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.211
you have a sort of hardwired set of movements

[AI] 但事实上。几年前。我们发现了一个非常惊人的现象。

26
00:01:26.764 --> 00:01:29.726
which is that if you make so-called "Picasso frogs" --
[AI] 如果你制作所谓的“毕加索青蛙”--

27
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.066
these are tadpoles where the jaws might be off to the side.
[AI] 这些是蝌蚪，它们的下颚可能偏侧。

28
00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:35.208
the eyes are up here. the nostrils are moved.
[AI] 眼睛在上面。鼻孔被移动。

29
00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:36.707
so everything is shifted --

30
00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:40.252
these tadpoles make largely normal frog faces.
[AI] 这些蝌蚪在很大程度上是正常的青蛙脸。

31
00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:41.426
Now. this is amazing.
[AI] 现在这太神奇了。

32
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:45.348
because all of the organs start off in abnormal positions.
[AI] 因为所有的器官都是以不正常的姿势开始的。

33
00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.101
and yet they still end up making a pretty good frog face.

35
00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:52.247
like many living systems.

36
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:54.404
is not a hardwired set of movements.

37
00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:58.166
but actually works to reduce the error between what's going on now
[AI] 但实际上可以减少现在发生的事情之间的误差

38
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.691
and what it knows is a correct frog face configuration.

138
00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:46.238
on to understanding that if your hardware is good enough --
[AI] 了解到如果你的硬件足够好--

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:50.050
and I'm going to tell you that biological hardware is absolutely good enough --
[AI] 我要告诉你们，生物硬件绝对足够好--

140
00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:55.499
then you can interact with your system not by tweaking or rewiring the hardware.
[AI] 然后，您可以与您的系统交互，而不是通过调整或重新布线硬件。

141
00:06:55.523 --> 00:06:59.292
but actually. you can take a step back and give it stimuli or inputs
[AI] 但事实上。你可以后退一步，给它刺激或输入

145
00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:12.386
So the ability to see these bioelectrical signals

146
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.273
is giving us an entry point directly into the software

149
00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:23.926
than to rewiring specific pathways inside of every cell.

So if you cut it into pieces -- in fact. over 200 pieces --
[AI] 所以如果你把它切成碎片——事实上。200多件--

So what we discovered is that if you cut it into three pieces
[AI] 我们发现如果你把它切成三块

170
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.867
and amputate the head and the tail and you just take this middle fragment.

176
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.196
and the important thing is that we don't apply electricity.
