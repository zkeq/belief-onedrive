00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:15.398
So, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport
几年前, 在肯尼迪机场,

2
00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:17.190
about to get on a flight,
我正在赶飞机,

3
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.006
when I was approached by two women
两名女士从后面追上我,

4
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:20.668
who I do not think would be insulted
我想她们大概不会介意

5
00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:22.062
to hear themselves described
我把她们描述为

6
00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:26.004
as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.
身材矮小, 言语粗陋的 美籍意大利老大妈。

7
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.150
The taller one, who is like up here,
个子高的那个, 大概这么高,

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.201
she comes marching up to me, and she goes,
她追上我, 然后问道,

9
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.520
"Honey, I gotta ask you something.
"亲爱的, 我想问你个事儿.

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.948
You got something to do with that whole
你是不是跟最近上映的那个什么

11
00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:37.970
'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"
《美食、祈祷和恋爱》有啥关系?" (译注:又名《一辈子做女孩》)

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.084
And I said, "Yes, I did."
我说, "是的。"

13
00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:41.872
And she smacks her friend and she goes,
然后她拍了一下她的朋友, 说道,

14
00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:44.026
"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.
"对吧, 我就说嘛, 就是她。

15
00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:45.976
That's that girl who wrote that book
那个根据电影的故事情节

16
00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:48.010
based on that movie."
写了本儿书的姑娘。"

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.164
(Laughter)
(笑声)

18
00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:52.340
So that's who I am.
这就是我。

19
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.045
And believe me, I'm extremely grateful to be that person,
相信我, 我还是非常感激那个人,

20
00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.043
because that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing
因为有关《美食、祈祷和恋爱》的一切

21
00:00:58.043 --> 00:00:59.787
was a huge break for me.
对我而言都是一个巨大的突破.

22
00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:02.295
But it also left me in a really tricky position
但是同时也把我推向了 一个尴尬的境地。

23
00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.203
moving forward as an author
作为一名作家,

24
00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:05.930
trying to figure out how in the world
我需要继续写作,

25
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.184
I was ever going to write a book again
但我无法确定我写的 下一本书能否得到

26
00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:09.029
that would ever please anybody,
读者的青睐,

27
00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.019
because I knew well in advance
因为我非常的清楚,

28
00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:13.971
that all of those people who had adored "Eat, Pray, Love"
无论我下一本书的内容是什么,

29
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:15.560
were going to be incredibly disappointed
那些热爱《美食、祈祷和恋爱》的读者们

30
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.943
in whatever I wrote next
都会无比失望,

31
00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.771
because it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,"
因为下一本书一定不会再是 《美食、祈祷和恋爱》,

32
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:21.217
and all of those people who had hated "Eat, Pray, Love"
而那些厌恶《美食、祈祷和恋爱》的读者们

33
00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:22.585
were going to be incredibly disappointed
也都会无比失望,

34
00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:24.028
in whatever I wrote next
无论我的下一本书写的是什么,

35
00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:26.481
because it would provide evidence that I still lived.
因为他们会失望的发现我还活得好好的。

36
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.643
So I knew that I had no way to win,
所以, 我知道怎么做都无法两全其美。

37
00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:32.099
and knowing that I had no way to win
当我刚开始意识到这一点的时候

38
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.003
made me seriously consider for a while
我很认真的考虑过

39
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:35.445
just quitting the game
要不要就此封笔,

40
00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:39.087
and moving to the country to raise corgis.
搬到乡下养养小狗退休算了。

41
00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:41.147
But if I had done that, if I had given up writing,
但是如果我真的这么做了, 真的放弃了,

42
00:01:41.147 --> 00:01:43.211
I would have lost my beloved vocation,
我将会失去所热爱的职业生涯,

43
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:45.419
so I knew that the task was that I had to find
所以我很清楚应该做什么，

44
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.818
some way to gin up the inspiration
就是要想办法重新激起斗志,

45
00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:49.250
to write the next book
继续写新书,

46
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.746
regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.
不去在意会收到怎样的负面评价。

47
00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:53.354
In other words, I had to find a way to make sure
换句话说, 我需要努力的找到一条出路,

48
00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:55.997
that my creativity survived its own success.
确保我在成功之后依旧保持创造力。

49
00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:58.420
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration,
最终, 我做到了, 我找到了动力,

50
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.958
but I found it in the most unlikely
只不过是在比较意外的、

51
00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.372
and unexpected place.
不太可能的场合.

52
00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.512
I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life
这其实是源于我早年

53
00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:07.620
about how creativity can survive its own failure.
失败时如何保持创造力的经验.

54
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.226
So just to back up and explain,
让我稍微重复一下,

55
00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:11.539
the only thing I have ever wanted to be
成为作家是我这辈子唯一希望能够

56
00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.136
for my whole life was a writer.
从事的职业。

57
00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:15.508
I wrote all through childhood, all through adolescence,
我从孩童时期就开始不停的写,  青少年时期也坚持着,

58
00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:17.324
by the time I was a teenager I was sending
当我只有十几岁的时候, 就已经

59
00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.160
my very bad stories to The New Yorker,
把写的不怎么样的故事 寄给了给《纽约客》,

60
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.436
hoping to be discovered.
希望能够被编辑发现。

61
00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:22.880
After college, I got a job as a diner waitress,
大学后我找了一份餐厅服务员的工作,

62
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.016
kept working, kept writing,
继续工作, 继续写作,

63
00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.264
kept trying really hard to get published,
继续努力的让自己的作品出版,

64
00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:28.976
and failing at it.
却连续的遭遇了失败。

65
00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:30.448
I failed at getting published
大概有六年的时间, 一直不断的

66
00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:32.024
for almost six years.
被出版社拒绝。

67
00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:33.632
So for almost six years, every single day,
在那六年的时间里的每一天,

68
00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:35.288
I had nothing but rejection letters
除了邮箱里收不完的拒信,

69
00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.940
waiting for me in my mailbox.
我一无所有。

70
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.690
And it was devastating every single time,
每一个这样的时刻都非常难熬,

71
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.934
and every single time, I had to ask myself
每一次我都不由得问自己,

72
00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:43.320
if I should just quit while I was behind
是不是应该放弃,

73
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.010
and give up and spare myself this pain.
不要再这么痛苦下去了。

74
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.304
But then I would find my resolve,
但是我又总是立刻就找回了斗志,

75
00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:49.826
and always in the same way,
每次都是如此,

76
00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:51.971
by saying, "I'm not going to quit,
对自己说, "我不会放弃,

77
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.792
I'm going home."
我要回家."

78
00:02:53.792 --> 00:02:54.740
And you have to understand that for me,
这里你们需要明白一点,

79
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.312
going home did not mean returning to my family's farm.
"回家"并不是指回到我的家族农场。

80
00:02:58.312 --> 00:02:59.870
For me, going home
对我而言,

81
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.421
meant returning to the work of writing
"回家"就是回去继续写作的意思,

82
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.306
because writing was my home,
因为写作就是我的家,

83
00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:06.522
because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing,
因为对写作的热爱,  远大于被拒绝带给我的伤痛,

84
00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:08.027
which is to say that I loved writing
或者说我对写作的热爱

85
00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:09.600
more than I loved my own ego,
胜过我对自我(ego)的爱,

86
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.004
which is ultimately to say
更直接的说,

87
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.596
that I loved writing more than I loved myself.
我爱写作胜过爱我自己。

88
00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:15.562
And that's how I pushed through it.
我就是这么挺过来的。

89
00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.426
But the weird thing is that 20 years later,
不过奇怪的是, 20年之后,

90
00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:18.924
during the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,"
当《美食、祈祷和恋爱》 带给我巨大成功的时候,

91
00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:21.530
I found myself identifying all over again
我发现自己又回到了从前的状态,

92
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.930
with that unpublished young diner waitress
那个无书可出的年轻服务员的状态,

93
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.098
who I used to be, thinking about her constantly,
我无时不刻不回想着过去的我,

94
00:03:26.098 --> 00:03:27.956
and feeling like I was her again,
觉得我又变成了当初的自己,

95
00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:29.721
which made no rational sense whatsoever
这听上去不太合理,

96
00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:31.698
because our lives could not have been more different.
毕竟过去和现在的我生活状态 已经大不一样了。

97
00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:33.146
She had failed constantly.
她一直遭遇失败.

98
00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.790
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.
而我获得了始料未及的成功。

99
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.140
We had nothing in common.
我们没有任何相似之处.

100
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.306
Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?
那么为什么我突然觉得自己很像她,  很像过去的自己?

101
00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:42.676
And it was only when I was trying to unthread that
直到我尝试一点一点的解开谜团,

102
00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:44.278
that I finally began to comprehend
我终于开始意识到,

103
00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:46.682
the strange and unlikely psychological connection
使现在和过去的我产生这种 奇怪的"心理联接"的原因,

104
00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:49.216
in our lives between the way we experience great failure
在于我们在面临巨大失败

105
00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.452
and the way we experience great success.
以及巨大成功时的应对方式。

106
00:03:51.452 --> 00:03:52.922
So think of it like this:
想象一下:

107
00:03:52.922 --> 00:03:54.672
For most of your life, you live out your existence
在你生命中绝大多数时间,  你的生活状态

108
00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:57.115
here in the middle of the chain of human experience
只是人类生活经历中的一个片段,

109
00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:00.193
where everything is normal and reassuring and regular,
普通, 安稳而又平常,

110
00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:03.653
but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here
而失败就相当于突然把你从这种状态中

111
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:06.587
into the blinding darkness of disappointment.
猛的推向了无尽黑暗和失望的深渊。

112
00:04:06.587 --> 00:04:10.141
Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far
成功也会如此突如其来的改变你,

113
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.509
way out over here
不同的是,

114
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.371
into the equally blinding glare
成功会给你带来

115
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:16.223
of fame and recognition and praise.
极高的认可、赞扬和威望。

116
00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:17.425
And one of these fates
这两种不同的命运,

117
00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.642
is objectively seen by the world as bad,
一种被这个世界视为是坏的,

118
00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.699
and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good,
另一种被这个世界认为是好的,

119
00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.347
but your subconscious is completely incapable
但是你的潜意识

120
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.075
of discerning the difference between bad and good.
完全无法区分这种好坏的差别。

121
00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:29.216
The only thing that it is capable of feeling
你唯一能够感知的

122
00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:32.676
is the absolute value of this emotional equation,
是在情绪上体验到的绝对值,

123
00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:35.291
the exact distance that you have been flung
是你在情绪上偏离常态的自己的

124
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.659
from yourself.
绝对值。

125
00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.715
And there's a real equal danger in both cases
而且(成功和失败)两种情形下都会面临

126
00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.261
of getting lost out there
同样的危机,

127
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:42.285
in the hinterlands of the psyche.
你可能迷失在心灵的孤岛中。

128
00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:43.818
But in both cases, it turns out that there is
而这两种不同的境遇,

129
00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:46.642
also the same remedy for self-restoration,
又有着相同的自我修复的方法，

130
00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:50.240
and that is that you have got to find your way back home again
就是你要尽可能快的, 顺利的

131
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.507
as swiftly and smoothly as you can,
找到回家的路.

132
00:04:52.507 --> 00:04:53.979
and if you're wondering what your home is,
如果你不知道自己"家"指的是哪里,

133
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.065
here's a hint:
有个技巧:

134
00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:57.291
Your home is whatever in this world you love
你的"家"就是你在这个世界上任何一个

135
00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.205
more than you love yourself.
爱它胜过爱自己的东西。

136
00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:01.291
So that might be creativity, it might be family,
可能是你的灵感和创意, 可能是家庭,

137
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.267
it might be invention, adventure,
可以是投资, 冒险,

138
00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:06.059
faith, service, it might be raising corgis,
信仰, 服务, 可以是养小狗,

139
00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.959
I don't know, your home is that thing
总之, 你的"家"就是这样一个东西,

140
00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.731
to which you can dedicate your energies
你会愿意将全部精力

141
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.777
with such singular devotion
投入其中,

142
00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:15.179
that the ultimate results become inconsequential.
而最终的结果并不是最重要的。

143
00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:17.683
For me, that home has always been writing.
对我来说, 这个"家"就是写作。

144
00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:20.255
So after the weird, disorienting success
所以在我出版《美食、祈祷和恋爱》之后

145
00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:21.953
that I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,"
经历这种奇特的、令人迷失的成功之后,

146
00:05:21.953 --> 00:05:23.367
I realized that all I had to do was exactly
我意识到我需要做的事情

147
00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:25.351
the same thing that I used to have to do all the time

148
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:27.581
when I was an equally disoriented failure.

149
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.359
I had to get my ass back to work,
我需要回"家"写作,

and that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:34.221
I was able to publish the dreaded follow-up
我终于在《美食、祈祷和恋爱》之后,

152
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:35.109
to "Eat, Pray, Love."
出版了新书。

153
00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:36.685
And you know what happened with that book?

It bombed, and I was fine.

Actually, I kind of felt bulletproof,

156

because I knew that I had broken the spell

157

and I had found my way back home

158

to writing for the sheer devotion of it.

159

And I stayed in my home of writing after that,
出版之后我继续在"家"中创作,

160
00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:51.589
and I wrote another book that just came out last year

161
00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.234
and that one was really beautifully received,
获得的反馈真的还不错,

162
00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:54.730
which is very nice, but not my point.
这非常好, 不过不是我的重点。

163
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.020
My point is that I'm writing another one now,

164

and I'll write another book after that

165
00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:00.037
and another and another and another

166
00:06:00.037 --> 00:06:01.235
and many of them will fail,
很多书的反响都不会太好,

167
00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:02.863
and some of them might succeed,
其中有几本或许会获得成功,

168
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:04.459
but I will always be safe
不过无论出版后反响如何剧烈,

169
00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.831
from the random hurricanes of outcome
我的内心都会感到平和,

170
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.381
as long as I never forget where I rightfully live.
只要我还记得我真心热爱的是什么。

171
00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:12.783
Look, I don't know where you rightfully live,

172
00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:14.453
but I know that there's something in this world

173
00:06:14.453 --> 00:06:16.525
that you love more than you love yourself.

174

Something worthy, by the way,

so addiction and infatuation don't count,
毒瘾和让你过分沉溺的东西不算,

176
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:24.038
because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right?
因为我们都知道这不是安全的"家", 不是么?

177
00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:26.085
The only trick is that you've got to identify

the best, worthiest thing that you love most,
从你热爱的事物中找到最有价值的,

179
00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:30.920
and then build your house right on top of it

180
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.797
and don't budge from it.

00:06:32.797 --> 00:06:35.141

get vaulted out of your home

by either great failure or great success,

then your job is to fight your way back to that home

is calling forth from you next.

and I can absolutely promise you, from long personal experience
