is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.

were actually friends waiting to be discovered.

is the gift of creativity.

98
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.922

than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.

That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --
现在你们正感觉到的小小的不安——

121
00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:06.066
(Laughter)
（笑声）

122
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.420
is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.

如果这次实验是你的邻居 首先介绍他们自己，他们的名字，

144
00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:22.854
where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?
从哪儿来，他们的孩子， 或者小狗的名字呢？

145
00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:27.037
Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying,
想象一下，随后有150个人 评价了他们，

146
00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:29.466
"They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
“他们很擅长拿着解锁的手机！”

147
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.347
(Laughter)
（笑声）

148
00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.726
Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?
现在你们觉得把手机 交出去感觉怎么样？

149
00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:40.756
It turns out,
事实证明，

150
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.232
a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.
一个精心设计的信誉体系 是建立信任的关键。

151
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:47.781
And we didn't actually get it right the first time.
我们也并不是初次就成功了。

152
00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:50.550
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
要让人们留下负面的评论 其实挺难的。

153
00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:55.653
Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts
最终，我们学到了 在展示所有的信息之前，

154
00:07:55.677 --> 00:07:57.781
left the review before we reveal them.
需要先等待房东与房客 都留下评论。

155
00:07:58.927 --> 00:08:02.019
Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.
我们上周才发现一件事。

156
00:08:02.804 --> 00:08:04.708
We did a joint study with Stanford,
我们与斯坦福大学合作进行合作，

157
00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:07.726
where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone
以年龄、居住地 和地理环境相似度为基础，

158
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.216
based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.
调查了人们对其他人的信任程度。

159
00:08:13.287 --> 00:08:16.247
The research showed, not surprisingly,
研究得出了一个意料之中的结果，

160
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:18.215
we prefer people who are like us.
我们更喜欢与我们相似的人。

161
00:08:19.914 --> 00:08:22.749
The more different somebody is,
与我们差异越大的人，

162
00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:24.100
the less we trust them.
我们越是不信任他们。

163
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.973
Now, that's a natural social bias.
这是一种与生俱来的社会偏见。

164
00:08:28.352 --> 00:08:30.706
But what's interesting is what happens
不过有趣的是，当你把信誉

165
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.688
when you add reputation into the mix,
放在一起考虑的时候会发生什么，

166
00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.552
in this case, with reviews.
在这里也就是评价。

167
00:08:35.218 --> 00:08:37.235
Now, if you've got less than three reviews,
如果你得到的评价少于三条，

168
00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:38.639
nothing changes.
什么都不会改变。

169
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.466
But if you've got more than 10,
但是如果你得到超过10条评价，

170
00:08:42.347 --> 00:08:44.263
everything changes.
所有事情就会发生变化。

171
00:08:44.287 --> 00:08:48.515
High reputation beats high similarity.
这时候，高的信誉评价就会 比高相似度更可信。

172
00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:52.849
The right design can actually help us overcome
正确的设计可以帮助我们克服

173
00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:55.055
one of our most deeply rooted biases.
扎根心底的认知偏差。

174
00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:00.175
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust
我们也发现要想得到 多少信任，就得

175
00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:02.452
takes the right amount of disclosure.
公开多少我们自己的信息。

176
00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:06.357
This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.
接下来就是房客第一次 发信息给房东时的情况。

177
00:09:07.682 --> 00:09:11.572
If you share too little, like, "Yo,"
如果你自我介绍得太少，比如，“呦，”

178
00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:14.303
acceptance rates go down.
那么你的接受率就会下降。

179
00:09:14.327 --> 00:09:16.444
And if you share too much, like,
如果你说太多，比如，

180
00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:18.161
"I'm having issues with my mother,"
“我跟我妈闹翻了，”

181
00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:19.335
(Laughter)
（笑声）

182
00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.351
acceptance rates also go down.
接受率也会走低。

183
00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:24.137
But there's a zone that's just right,
不过也是有适当的表达，

184
00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:28.459
like, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."
比如，“喜欢你房间的艺术品， 打算和家人一起去度假。”

185
00:09:28.483 --> 00:09:31.792
So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?
那么，要如何确定 怎样才是适当的表达呢？

186
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.935
We use the size of the box to suggest the right length,
我们通过消息盒子的大小 来建议房客合适的字数，

187
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.197
and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.
而且我们还适度地引导 并鼓励他们分享。

188
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.076
We bet our whole company
我们通过好的设计，

189
00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:45.609
on the hope that,
把整个公司

190
00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:47.516
with the right design,
都押在这样一个希望上，

191
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.809
people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.
人们愿意克服 畏惧陌生人的偏见。

192
00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:53.120
What we didn't realize
但是我们并没有意识到

193
00:09:53.144 --> 00:09:55.578
is just how many people
到底有多少人

194
00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:57.977
were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.
已经准备好去克服这种偏见了。

195
00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:02.394
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.
这是我们订单接受率的图表。

196
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.275
There's three things happening here.
这张图表说明了三件事。

197
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:09.616
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.

198
00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:12.781
The second is the efforts of our team.
第二，这是我们团队努力的成果。

199
00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:17.402
And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.
第三，我们之前所做的 还并不完全令人满意。

200
00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.296
Now, things have been going pretty well.
现在，事情正在越变越好。

201
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.112
Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.
但不可否认，我们也出过一些问题。

202
00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:27.431
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties
比如客人不经主人同意举办派对，

203
00:10:27.455 --> 00:10:28.724
and trashed homes.
并且把家里弄得一团糟。

204
00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:32.604
Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.
还有，房客滞留在雨中无法入住， 房东却坐视不管。

205
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:37.445
In the early days, I was customer service,
在事业早期，我也承担过客服工作，

206
00:10:37.973 --> 00:10:40.896
and those calls came right to my cell phone.

I was at the front lines of trust breaking.

208
00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:47.864
And there's nothing worse than those calls,
实在是没什么要比这些电话更糟了，

209
00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:50.117
it hurts to even think about them.
任何时候想起来都会觉得心痛。

210
00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:53.626
And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice
电话那头的声音透露出的失望，

211
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.389
was and, I would say, still is
说实话，始终都是

212
00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:58.853
our single greatest motivator to keep improving.

less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.

Of course, not every stay is like that.

is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.

244
00:12:47.652 --> 00:12:49.976
But if you just called it the rental economy,

245
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.597
it would be incomplete.

现如今，房子的设计理念都  以私隐和分隔为主。

要是房子的设计从一开始  就融入了分享的概念会怎么样呢？

262
00:13:46.253 --> 00:13:47.607
What would that look like?
