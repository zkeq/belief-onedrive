00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.636
Chris Anderson: So Robert spent the last few years think about how weird human behavior is,
克里斯·安德森（CA）：罗伯特最近几年在探索人类的行为到底有多奇怪，

2
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.876
and how inadequate most of our language trying to explain it is.
以及我们大多数语言所尝试的解释有多么的不足。

3
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.956
And it's very exciting to hear him explain some of the thinking behind it in public for the first time.
能听他第一次在公开场合解释一些其后的观点是非常令人兴奋的。

4
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.076
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.
现在有请，罗伯特·萨波尔斯基。

5
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.060
(Applause)
（掌声）

6
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.476
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.
RS：谢谢。

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.980
The fantasy always runs something like this.
心理幻想通常是这样的：

8
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.756
I've overpowered his elite guard, burst into his secret bunker with my machine gun ready.
我已经用我的枪制服了他的精英部队攻入了他的堡垒

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.676
He lunges for his Luger.
他抓起鲁格手枪，

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.516
I knock it out of his hand.
我打掉他的手枪，

11
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.876
He lunges for his cyanide pill.
他拿起氰化物毒丸，

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.636
I knock that out of his hand.
我又把它们打掉。

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.956
He snarls,
他咆哮着，

14
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.196
comes at me with otherworldly strength.
用吃奶的力气向我冲过来。

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.916
We grapple, we fight,
我们扭打，我们厮杀，

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.836
I manage to pin him down
我终于把他撂倒，

17
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.420
and put on handcuffs.
给他戴上手铐。

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.316
"Adolf Hitler," I say,
“阿道夫·希特勒，”我说，

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.180
"I arrest you for crimes against humanity."
“我以反人类罪逮捕你。”

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.796
Here's where the Medal of Honor version of the fantasy ends
荣誉勋章版本的幻想就此处结束，

21
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.676
and the imagery darkens.
你也缓过神来了。

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.419
What would I do if I had Hitler?
如果我真的抓到了希特勒，我会怎么做？

23
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.740
It's not hard to imagine once I allow myself.
一旦我允许自己开始想象就很难停下来，

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.676
Sever his spine at the neck.
拧断他的脖子、

25
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.076
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.
用钝刀挖出他的眼睛、

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.876
Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.
刺穿他的耳膜、切掉他的舌头

27
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.036
Leave him alive on a respirator,
让他靠呼吸器和导管活着，

28
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.356
tube-fed, not able to speak or move or see or hear, just to feel,
不能说话不能动，看不见也听不见，就这么活着，

29
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.636
and then inject him with something cancerous
然后给他注射致癌物，

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.916
that's going to fester and pustulate
让他溃烂化脓，

31
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.876
until every cell in his body is screaming in agony,
直到他身体的每一个细胞都在极度痛苦中尖叫，

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.140
until every second feels like an eternity in hell.
直到每一秒都像活在地狱中一样。

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.340
That's what I would do to Hitler.
那就是我会对希特勒做的。

34
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.756
I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,
我从小时候就开始有这个幻想，

35
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.276
still do sometimes,
现在也偶尔有，

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.956
and when I do, my heart speeds up --
当我这样想时，我的心跳加快——

37
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.860
all these plans for the most evil, wicked soul in history.
所有这一切都是为了除掉这个千古罪人

38
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.916
But there's a problem,
但是有一个问题，

39
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.836
which is I don't actually believe in souls or evil,
我实际上并不相信灵魂或魔鬼，

40
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.396
and I think wicked belongs in a musical.
我觉得那些坏蛋只是音乐剧里的形象

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.836
But there's some people I would like to see killed,
有时候我想亲眼看到某些人死去

42
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.676
but I'm against the death penalty.
但我又反对死刑。

43
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.796
But I like schlocky violent movies,
我喜欢蹩脚的暴力电影，

44
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.596
but I'm for strict gun control.
但我又支持严格控枪。

45
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.676
But then there was a time I was at a laser tag place,
然后有一次我去玩激光枪，

46
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.580
and I had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people.
躲在角落里射击别人我觉得好过瘾。

47
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.980
In other words, I'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence.
换句话说，当涉及暴力时，我的人格基本就混乱了

48
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.916
Now, as a species, we obviously have problems with violence.
作为人类这样一个物种，我们显然有暴力的问题。

49
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.996
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,
我们用淋浴头输送毒气，

50
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.110
letters with anthrax, airplanes as weapons,
让信件里夹带炭疽，把飞机当作武器，

51
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.996
mass rape as a military strategy.
把大规模强奸作为军事战略。

52
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.670
We're a miserably violent species.
我们真是一个可悲的暴力物种。

53
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.236
But there's a complication,
但是复杂的是，

54
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.636
which is we don't hate violence,
我们讨厌的不是暴力本身，

55
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.516
we hate the wrong kind.
我们讨厌的是那些有弊端的暴力。

56
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.996
And when it's the right kind,
如果是正确的暴力，

57
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.480
we cheer it on, we hand out medals,
我们欢呼雀跃，我们为他们颁发奖牌，

58
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.676
we vote for, we mate with our champions of it.
为他投票，与冠军亲热。

59
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.516
When it's the right kind of violence,
所以如果是所谓正确的暴力，

60
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.740
we love it.
我们就赞同它。

61
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.996
And there's another complication,
还有另外一个复杂的情况，

62
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.050
which is, in addition to us being this miserably violent species,
我们除了是可悲的暴力物种之外，

63
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.900
we're also this extraordinarily altruistic, compassionate one.
同时也是极其无私的，富有同情心的物种。

64
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.636
So how do you make sense of the biology of our best behaviors,
那么，该如何用生物学合理解释

65
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.620
our worst ones and all of those ambiguously in between?
最好的行为、最差的行为以及两者之间的所有模糊行为？

66
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.956
Now, for starters,
首先，

67
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.276
what's totally boring is understanding the motoric aspects of the behavior.
理解行为的肌肉运动是最无聊的。

68
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.476
Your brain tells your spine, tells your muscles
你的大脑告诉脊椎，告诉肌肉，

69
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.756
to do something or other,
去做这个或那个，

70
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.716
and hooray, you've behaved.
好嘞，动作完成。

71
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.396
What's hard is understanding the meaning of the behavior,
难点在于，理解行为的意义，

72
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.236
because in some settings, pulling a trigger is an appalling act;
因为在某些场景中，扣扳机是令人作呕的动作；

73
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.236
in others, it's heroically self-sacrificial.
而在另一些场合中，它就代表英勇地自我牺牲。

74
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.676
In some settings, putting your hand one someone else's is deeply compassionate.
在某些情况下，把你的手放在别人身上是深深的同情。

75
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.596
In others, it's a deep betrayal.
在另一些情况中，却是一个深刻的背叛。

76
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.436
The challenge is to understand the biology of the context of our behaviors,
难点就在于要理解我们行为背后的生物学，

77
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.060
and that's real tough.
这才是真正的难的地方。

78
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.036
One thing that's clear, though, is you're not going to get anywhere
不过，有一点很清楚，

79
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.860
if you think there's going to be the brain region or the hormone
如果你认为某个大脑区域、某种激素、

80
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.750
or the gene or the childhood experience or the evolutionary mechanism that explains everything.
某个基因、特定童年经历或某个进化机制就能解释一切的话，你不会弄明白这些行为的。

81
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.980
Instead, every bit of behavior has multiple levels of causality.
相反，每个小小的行为都有多层次的因果关系。

82
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.020
Let's look at an example.
我们来看一个例子。

83
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.860
You have a gun.
你手里有枪，

84
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.116
There's a crisis going on:
当前正发生危险

85
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.716
rioting, violence, people running around.
动乱，暴力，人们到处跑。

86
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.916
A stranger is running at you in an agitated state --
一个陌生人向你跑来，情绪激动——

87
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.036
you can't quite tell if the expression is frightened, threatening, angry --
你说不清楚那表情是害怕、还是威胁、还是愤怒——

88
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.276
holding something that kind of looks like a handgun.
反正那人手里拿着的好象是手枪

89
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.516
You're not sure.
你还不能确定。

90
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.436
The stranger comes running at you
你一看那人冲你跑了过来

91
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.196
and you pull the trigger.
你就扣了扳机。

92
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.380
And it turns out that thing in this person's hand was a cell phone.
最后却发现，这个人的手里是一部手机。

93
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.236
So we asked this biological question:
所以我问一个生物学问题：

94
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.436
what was going on that caused this behavior?
这一连串的行为发生时你身体里的究竟发生了什么？

95
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.356
What caused this behavior?
是什么导致了这种行为？

96
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.676
And this is a multitude of questions.
这其实是一个复杂的问题。

97
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.916
We start.
我们开始。

98
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.356
What was going on in your brain one second before you pulled that trigger?
在拉动扳机的前一秒钟，你的大脑里发生了什么？

99
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.076
And this brings us into the realm of a brain region called the amygdala.
这就要说到被称为杏仁核的大脑区域。

100
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.036
The amygdala, which is central to violence, central to fear,
杏仁核是产生暴力恐惧的控制中心，

101
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.690
initiates volleys of cascades
它启动一系列反应

102
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.036
that produce pulling of a trigger.
从而产生了扣扳机的动作。

103
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.740
What was the level of activity in your amygdala one second before?
那么扣扳机前一秒杏仁核的活动级别是多少？

104
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.076
But to understand that, we have to step back a little bit.
但如果要理解它，我们又必须再讲点别的

105
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.436
What was going on in the environment seconds to minutes before that impacted the amygdala?
数秒至数分钟之前，周围的环境里发生了什么影响了杏仁核？

106
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.796
Now, obviously, the sights, the sounds of the rioting, that was pertinent.
显然，暴乱的景象、声音都是与之有关系。

107
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.036
But in addition,
但除此之外，

108
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.420
you're more likely to mistake a cell phone for a handgun if that stranger was male and large and of a different race.
如果这个陌生人是男性，而且身材高大和你还不是一个种族的那你把手机误认成手枪的几率就会更大。

109
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.316
Furthermore, if you're in pain,
此外，如果你正疼痛，

110
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.516
if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,
饥饿，疲惫不堪，

111
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.076
your frontal cortex is not going to work as well,
你的前额叶皮质也会停止工作。

112
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.756
part of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time
前额叶皮质是大脑的一部分，

113
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.510
saying, "Are you really sure that's a gun there?"
它的作用是及时联系杏仁核并问：“你真的确定那是枪吗？”

114
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.756
But we need to step further back.
现在我们往这之前看

115
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.956
Now we have to look at hours to days before,
看看几天前或几小时前发生了什么

116
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.956
and with this, we have entered the realm of hormones.
这样我们说到激素了。

117
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.116
For example, testosterone,
例如，睾酮，

118
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.876
where regardless of your sex,
无论你是什么性别，

119
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.756
if you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood,
如果你血液中的睾酮水平高，

120
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.236
you're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression is instead looking threatening.
那么你更有可能把一张表情中性的面孔当成有威胁性的。

121
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.116
Elevated testosterone levels, elevated levels of stress hormones,
当睾酮水平升高、应激激素水平升高，

122
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.436
and your amygdala is going to be more active
杏仁核会更加活跃，

123
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.940
and your frontal cortex will be more sluggish.
前额叶皮质则会更迟钝。

124
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.876
Pushing back further, weeks to months before,
退回到数周至数月之前，

125
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.356
where's the relevance there?
那时候与现在有什么联系呢?

126
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.916
This is the realm of neural plasticity,
这就要说到神经可塑性领域了，

127
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.876
the fact that your brain can change in response to experience,
大脑会根据于经历的变化而改变，

128
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.076
and if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma,
如果你之前几个月的生活 充满压力和创伤，

129
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.956
your amygdala will have enlarged.
你的杏仁核就会扩大。

130
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.196
The neurons will have become more excitable,
神经元会变得更加容易兴奋，

131
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.556
your frontal cortex would have atrophied,
前额叶皮质也就会萎缩了，

132
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.380
all relevant to what happens in that one second.
这些都与那一秒钟内发生的事情相关。

133
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.796
But we push back even more, back years,
但是，我们再多往前看几年的话

134
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.316
back, for example, to your adolescence.
例如，回到你的青春期。

135
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.596
Now, the central fact of the adolescent brain is all of it is going full blast
青春期大脑的各部分功能都十分的活跃

136
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.316
except the frontal cortex,
除了前额叶皮质，

137
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.076
which is still half-baked.
前额叶皮质还是半成熟。

138
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.276
It doesn't fully mature until you're around 25.
它到25岁左右才能完全成熟。

139
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.516
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood
因此，青春期和成年早期这样的关键阶段

140
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.846
are the years where environment and experience 
塑造并决定了

141
00:07:17.847 --> 00:07:23.500
sculpt your frontal cortex into the version you're going to have as an adult in that critical moment.
你将来拥有什么样的前额叶皮质。

142
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.396
But pushing back even further,
但再退一步想想，

143
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.876
even further back to childhood and fetal life
甚至可以退到童年和胎儿时期，

144
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.716
and all the different versions that that could come in.
以及可能会导致的各种情况。

145
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.996
Now, obviously, that's the time that your brain is being constructed,
显然，那是大脑的逐渐成熟的阶段，

146
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.190
and that's important,
是很重要的阶段，

147
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.556
but in addition, experience during those times
但另外，那些时期的经历

148
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.556
produce what are called epigenetic changes,
产生所谓的表观遗传变化，

149
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.236
permanent, in some cases,
某些情况下是永久的变化，

150
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.596
permanently activating certain genes, turning off others.
永久地激活某些基因，关闭另一些基因。

151
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.116
And as an example of this,
比如说

152
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.156
if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through your mother,
如果胎儿时期通过母亲接触了许多压力激素，

153
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.596
epigenetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood
表观遗传会使成年时期的杏仁核

154
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.556
as a more excitable form,
塑造成更容易兴奋的形式，

155
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.220
and you're going to have elevated stress hormone levels.
你的应激激素水平会比较高。

156
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.676
But pushing even further back,
但是远一点讲，

157
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.396
back to when you were just a fetus,
当你只是一个胎儿，

158
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.236
back to when all you were was a collection of genes.
只是一堆基因的阶段。

159
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.636
Now, genes are really important to all of this,
基因对于所有这些都是非常重要的，

160
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.396
but critically, genes don't determine anything,
但是，基因不能确定任何东西，

161
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.060
because genes work differently in different environments.
因为基因在不同的环境中工作方式不同。

162
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.716
Key example here:
一个重要的例子：

163
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.876
there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,
有一个称为MAO-α的基因变体，

164
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.556
and if you have that variant,
如果你有这种变体，

165
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:35.236
you are far more likely to commit antisocial violence if, and only if, you were abused as a child.
并且在小时候受到虐待那么你极有可能做出反社会的暴力行为。

166
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.636
Genes and environment interact,
基因和环境相互作用，

167
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.276
and what's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger
在扣扳机的前一秒钟内发生的事

168
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.540
reflects your lifetime of those gene-environment interactions.
反映了你基因与环境一直以来的相互作用。

169
00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:50.116
Now, remarkably enough, we've got to push even further back now,
现在，我们再往前退

170
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.516
back centuries.
退回到几个世纪前。

171
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.876
What were your ancestors up to.
看看你的祖先经历了什么。

172
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.076
And if, for example, they were nomadic pastoralists,
如果他们是游牧民族，

173
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.356
they were pastoralists,
他们是牧民，

174
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.956
people living in deserts or grasslands
生活在沙漠或草原上，

175
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.636
with their herds of camels, cows, goats,
有骆驼、牛群、羊群，

176
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.716
odds are they would have invented what's called a culture of honor
他们很可能会创造出所谓的荣誉文化，

177
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.900
filled with warrior classes,
充满战士阶层、

178
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.676
retributive violence, clan vendettas,
报复性暴力、氏族纷争，

179
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.956
and amazingly, centuries later,
令人惊讶的是，几个世纪以后，

180
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.660
that would still be influencing the values with which you were raised.
这仍影响着你成长的价值观。

181
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.756
But we've got to push even further back,
我们再往前说

182
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.516
back millions of years,
回到数百万年前，

183
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.596
because if we're talking about genes,
因为如果我们要讨论基因，

184
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.276
implicitly we're now talking about the evolution of genes.
显然我们要谈谈基因的演变情况。

185
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.516
And what you see is, for example,
而你所看到的就是，例如，

186
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.036
patterns across different primate species.
不同灵长类动物的生存模式。

187
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.476
Some of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression,
有些进化成的侵略性非常低，

188
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.036
others have evolved in the opposite direction,
另一些则相反，

189
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.910
and floating there in between by every measure are humans,
而处于两者之间的就是人类，

190
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.876
once again this confused, barely defined species
所以这种混乱的、几乎无法定义的物种

191
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.140
that has all these potentials to go one way or the other.
有潜力向任何一个方向发展。

192
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.196
So what has this gotten us to?
那这对我们的影响是什么呢？

193
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.196
Basically, what we're seeing here is,
基本到目前为止我们都明白的了

194
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.116
if you want to understand a behavior,
如果你想了解一个行为，

195
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.996
whether it's an appalling one, a wondrous one,
无论是一个可怕的行为、奇妙的行为、

196
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.720
or confusedly in between,
还是两者之间的行为，

197
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.316
if you want to understand that,
只要你想要理解这样的行为

198
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.956
you've got take into account what happened a second before to a million years before, everything in between.
就必须考虑这个行为前一秒到前一百万年，以及这中间发生的一切。

199
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.956
So what can we conclude at this point?
那么我们现在可以得出什么结论呢？

200
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.276
Officially, it's complicated.
正式的说：这很复杂。

201
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.916
Wow, that's really helpful.
嗯，这句话确实很有用。

202
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.196
It's complicated,
这很复杂，

203
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:26.156
and you'd better be real careful, real cautious before you conclude you know what causes a behavior,
在你断定是什么导致一个行为之前，你最好小心再小心

204
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.940
especially if it's a behavior you're judging harshly.
特别是一个你要严肃判决的行为。

205
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.796
Now, to me, the single most important point about all of this is one having to do with change.
对我来说，所有这一切最重要的一点就是改变。

206
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:43.196
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here can change in different circumstances.
我在这提到的有关于生物学的每一点，其实都可以在不同情况下改变。

207
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.036
For example, ecosystems change.
例如，生态系统会变。

208
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.476
Thousands of years ago, the Sahara was a lush grassland.
数千年前，撒哈拉沙漠是一片绿洲。

209
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.116
Cultures change.
文化会变。

210
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.476
In the 17th century, the most terrifying people in Europe were the Swedes,

211
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.236
rampaging all over the place.
到处行凶。

212
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.436
This is what the Swedish military does now.

213
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.300
They haven't had a war in 200 years.
他们已经200年没有战争了。

214
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.556
Most importantly,
最重要的是，

215
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.196
brains change.
大脑会变。

216
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.236
Neurons grow new processes.

217
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.716
Circuits disconnect.

Everything in the brain changes,
大脑中的一切都会发生变化，

219
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.620
and out of this come extraordinary examples of human change.

220
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.836

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.916
a British theologian
英国神学家，

225
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.596

239
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.476
Now, it doesn't always require decades.

240
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.196
Sometimes, extraordinary change could happen in just hours.
有时，惊人的变化可能会在短短几个小时内发生。

241
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.596
Consider the World War I Christmas truce of 1914.

256
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.236
for these men to develop a completely new category of "us,"

all of us in the trenches here on both sides, dying for no damn reason,
双方的战壕里，我们所有人，都在没有任何理由地死掉，

This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man who stopped the My Lai Massacre.
