00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.980
Just over a year ago,
就在一年之前，

2
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.036
for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.
我陷入了人生的第三次休克。

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.340
I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
当时我正经历一个小手术， 我的大脑里满是麻醉剂。

4
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.676
I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart
我记得，我感到了超脱与分离，

5
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
and a coldness.
还有寒冷的感觉。

6
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.116
And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented,
随后我苏醒了， 昏昏欲睡，毫无方向感，

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.580
but definitely there.
但确乎是活过来了。

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.916
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,
当你从深睡中醒来时，

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.196
you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping,
你会分不清时间， 还可能会担忧睡过了头，

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.956
but there's always a basic sense of time having passed,
但至少能感到时间的流逝，

11
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.196
of a continuity between then and now.
可以感到过去到现在是连续的。

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.436
Coming round from anesthesia is very different.
然而从麻醉中苏醒是非常不同的。

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.956
I could have been under for five minutes, five hours,
我可能已经昏睡了5分钟，5小时，

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.396
five years or even 50 years.
5年，甚至50年。

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.876
I simply wasn't there.
我感觉不到自己的存在。

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.140
It was total oblivion.
是完全麻木无感的。

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.116
Anesthesia -- it's a modern kind of magic.
麻醉剂—— 是现代的一种魔法，

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.316
It turns people into objects,
它把人变成物体，

19
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.340
and then, we hope, back again into people.
然后我们希望之后还能变回常人。

20
00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:00.596
And in this process
在这个过程中，

21
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.860
is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.
蕴含着一个科学与哲学的未解之谜。

22
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.836
How does consciousness happen?
意识是如何形成的？

23
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.076
Somehow, within each of our brains,
在每个人的大脑中，

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.996
the combined activity of many billions of neurons,
有数十亿的神经元以某种方式联合作用，

25
00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:14.054
each one a tiny biological machine,
每个小小的神经元都是生物机器，

26
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.876
is generating a conscious experience.
它们创造了每一段意识体验。

27
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.836
And not just any conscious experience --
而且这并不是任意的意识体验，

28
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.241
your conscious experience right here and right now.
而恰好是你此时此地的意识体验。

29
00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:21.465
How does this happen?
这是如何发生的？

30
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.436
Answering this question is so important
这个问题的答案很重要，

31
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.316
because consciousness for each of us is all there is.
因为我们每个人都有意识，

32
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.340
Without it there's no world,
没有意识，就没有世界，

33
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.596
there's no self,
没有自我，

34
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.156
there's nothing at all.
没有一切。

35
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.133
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously
当我们经受苦难时， 也是有意识地经历着，

36
00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.237
whether it's through mental illness or pain.
无论是心理还是身体上的痛苦。

37
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.156
And if we can experience joy and suffering,
如果我们可以感到快乐和痛苦，

38
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.620
what about other animals?
其它的动物呢？

39
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.556
Might they be conscious, too?
它们是否也有意识？

40
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.236
Do they also have a sense of self?
是否也有自我的认知？

41
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.396
And as computers get faster and smarter,
而且现在电脑的运转越来越迅速， 越来越智能，

42
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.996
maybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away,
也许突然之间， 也许就在不久的将来，

43
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.756
when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.
我的 iPhone 会意识到它自己的存在。

44
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.260
I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
事实上，我认为 距离有意识的人工智能出现还是很遥远的。

45
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.156
And I think this because my research is telling me
因为我的研究告诉我，

46
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.836
that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence
意识不单单是智力的表现，

47
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.436
and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.
而是更多的有关于我们的本性， 作为活着、能呼吸的有机体。

48
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.156
Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.
意识和智力差别是很大的。

49
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.
就算你不聪明你也会感到痛苦， 但前提是你得活着。

50
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.716
In the story I'm going to tell you,
在接下来我要讲给你们的故事中，

51
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.076
our conscious experiences of the world around us,
我们对周围世界的意识体验，

52
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.436
and of ourselves within it,
以及我们自己的存在，

53
00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.996
are kinds of controlled hallucinations
都是被控制的错觉，

54
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.
都源自我们的生命体。

55
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.996
Now, you might have heard that we know nothing
你可能听说过，

56
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.776
about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
我们对大脑和身体如何产生意识一无所知。

57
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.916
Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.
甚至有人认为这已超过了科学的范畴。

58
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.156
But in fact,
但事实上，

59
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.316
the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.
在过去的25年里，在这一领域里的 科学研究取得了重大突破。

60
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.116
If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex,
如果你来到我在苏塞克斯大学的实验室，

61
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.300
you'll find scientists from all different disciplines
你会发现来自不同学科的科学家们，

62
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.940
and sometimes even philosophers.
甚至哲学家们，

63
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.596
All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens
都在试着弄明白意识是如何形成的，

64
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.340
and what happens when it goes wrong.
还有当它出错时会发生什么。

65
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.836
And the strategy is very simple.
其实我们的办法非常简单。

66
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.836
I'd like you to think about consciousness
我希望你们思考意识

67
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.076
in the way that we've come to think about life.
就像我们思考生命一样。

68
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.716
At one time, people thought the property of being alive
人们曾一度认为生命

69
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.356
could not be explained by physics and chemistry --
不能完全被物理和化学原理所解释，

70
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.540
that life had to be more than just mechanism.
也就是说人们认为生命不仅仅是机制。

71
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.196
But people no longer think that.
但现在人们不再这样想了。

72
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.836
As biologists got on with the job
随着生物学家的研究推进，

73
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.436
of explaining the properties of living systems
用物理、化学原理解释

74
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.276
in terms of physics and chemistry --
生物系统的特性

75
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.356
things like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis --
像是新陈代谢，繁衍后代，体内平衡这些——

76
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.196
the basic mystery of what life is started to fade away,
生命的神秘感渐渐消退，

77
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.276
and people didn't propose any more magical solutions,
人们也不再给出神奇的解释，

78
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.300
like a force of life or an élan vital.
比如这是生命的力量，生命的热忱之类的。

79
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.556
So as with life, so with consciousness.
所以意识其实和生命一样。

80
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.876
Once we start explaining its properties
一旦我们试着解释它的特性，

81
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.596
in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies,
就大脑和身体内部发生的事情而言，

82
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.036
the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is
什么是意识的不解之谜

83
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.796
should start to fade away.
就会变得了无生趣。

84
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.540
At least that's the plan.
我们计划就是这样的。

85
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.356
So let's get started.
那么咱们开始。

86
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.356
What are the properties of consciousness?
意识的特性是什么？

87
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.904
What should a science of consciousness try to explain?
意识科学需要解释什么？

88
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.476
Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.
那么今天，我想把意识分为两类讨论。

89
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.876
There are experiences of the world around us,
一类是我们对于外界的认知，

90
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.116
full of sights, sounds and smells,
包括影像、声音、气味，

91
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.060
there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.
这是多感官的、全景的、 3D的、身临其境的内心电影。

92
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.380
And then there's conscious self.
第二类就是意识本身了。

93
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.356
The specific experience of being you or being me.
也就是成为你或我的明确的体验。

94
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.396
The lead character in this inner movie,
是这部电影的主角，

95
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.780
and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.
也可能就是我们所执着的意识层面。

96
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.116
Let's start with experiences of the world around us,
让我们从体验周围的世界开始讲起，

97
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.875
and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.
从认识到大脑是一个预测引擎开始。

98
00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.659
Imagine being a brain.
想象你就是大脑。

99
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.075
You're locked inside a bony skull,
你被禁锢在头颅里，

100
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.316
trying to figure what's out there in the world.
尝试了解外面的世界有什么。

101
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.356
There's no lights inside the skull. There's no sound either.
头颅里没有光，也没有声音。

102
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.156
All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses
你所能感到的只有脉冲电流，

103
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.356
which are only indirectly related to things in the world,
这是你与外界事物的唯一的间接联系，

104
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.580
whatever they may be.
不管它们是什么。

105
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.476
So perception -- figuring out what's there --
所以说感知—— 或者说搞明白那是什么

106
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.356
has to be a process of informed guesswork
是一个“已知”的猜测过程。

107
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.516
in which the brain combines these sensory signals
大脑将这些感觉信号

108
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.596
with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is
与之前对世界的预期或信念相结合

109
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.756
to form its best guess of what caused those signals.
做出是什么产生了这些信号的最佳猜想。

110
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.476
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
大脑是看不见也听不见的。

111
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.860
What we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.
我们所感知到的是它对外界事物的最佳猜测。

112
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.780
Let me give you a couple of examples of all this.
我举些例子说明一下吧。

113
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.196
You might have seen this illusion before,
你之前可能有过这样的错觉，

114
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.476
but I'd like you to think about it in a new way.
但我希望你能重新思考一下。

115
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.556
If you look at those two patches, A and B,
当你看这两块区域时，A和B，

116
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.900
they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right?
它们是深浅不同的灰色，对吧？

117
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.836
But they are in fact exactly the same shade.
但实际上它们颜色是一样的。

118
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.196
And I can illustrate this.
我能解释这一现象。

119
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.436
If I put up a second version of the image here
如果我再在这儿加上第二版图像

120
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.476
and join the two patches with a gray-colored bar,
用灰条连接这两块区域，

121
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.156
you can see there's no difference.
你会发现，它们毫无差别。

122
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.956
It's exactly the same shade of gray.
它们的灰度完全一样。

123
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.636
And if you still don't believe me,
如果你还不相信我，

124
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.900
I'll bring the bar across and join them up.
我把灰条移走 把它们重合在一起。

125
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.860
It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.
它们是一样的灰度， 完全相同。

126
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.276
This isn't any kind of magic trick.
这不是什么魔术。

127
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.716
It's the same shade of gray,
它们就是一样的灰度，

128
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.940
but take it away again, and it looks different.
但是去掉灰条， 它们看起来有不一样了。

129
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.316
So what's happening here
那么究竟发生了什么呢？

130
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.156
is that the brain is using its prior expectations
就是大脑用它先前的预期

131
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.276
built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex
深入到视觉皮层的回路中

132
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.996
that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface,
使得一个投影看起来变暗了，

133
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.660
so that we see B as lighter than it really is.
所以我们看到的区域B比实际的颜色要亮。

134
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.996
Here's one more example,
还有一个例子，

135
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.190
which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions
证明大脑可以快速使用新的预测

136
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.516
to change what we consciously experience.
来改变我们的意识体验。

137
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.740
Have a listen to this.
请听这段声音。

138
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.300
(Distorted voice)
（扭曲的声音）

139
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.716
Sounded strange, right?
听起来很奇怪，对吧？

140
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.169
Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.
咱们再听一次 看你能不能听出点什么。

141
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.540
(Distorted voice)
（扭曲的声音）

142
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.956
Still strange.
还是很奇怪。

143
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.180
Now listen to this.
接下来，请听这个

144
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.796
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.
（录音）Anil Seth:  “我觉得英国脱欧真是个馊主意。”

145
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.156
(Laughter)
（笑声 ）

146
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.396
Which I do.
这是我的声音。

147
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.236
So you heard some words there, right?
你们听到了一些词，对吧？

148
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.350
Now listen to the first sound again. I'm just going to replay it.
现在再听一遍第一段声音。 我会重播一遍。

149
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.436
(Distorted voice)
（扭曲的声音）

150
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.956
Yeah? So you can now hear words there.
你可以听出一些单词了吧？

151
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.180
Once more for luck.
再试一次。

152
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.860
(Distorted voice)
（扭曲的声音）

153
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.076
OK, so what's going on here?
所以到底是怎么回事？

154
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.676
The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain
值得注意的是 进入大脑的感受信息

155
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.900
hasn't changed at all.
完全没有改变。

156
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.036
All that's changed is your brain's best guess
变了的，只是你脑中的猜测，

157
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.116
of the causes of that sensory information.
对感受信息的猜测。

158
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.500
And that changes what you consciously hear.
而这改变了你下意识所听到的东西。

159
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.516
All this puts the brain basis of perception
这些使大脑的感知基础

160
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.996
in a bit of a different light.
处于不同的亮度中。

161
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.030
Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain
感知并不单纯取决于

162
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.596
from the outside world,
外界传入脑中的信号，

163
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.116
it depends as much, if not more,
而是更多地取决于

164
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.060
on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.
反向流动的感知预测。

165
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.036
We don't just passively perceive the world,
我们并非被动地感受着世界，

166
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.756
we actively generate it.
相反，我们积极地创造着一切。

167
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.396
The world we experience comes as much, if not more,
我们对于世界的意识体验

168
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.756
from the inside out
既是由内而外的，

169
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.100
as from the outside in.
也是由外到内的。

170
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.636
Let me give you one more example of perception
我再举一个感知的例子，

171
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.540
as this active, constructive process.
这是一个积极的，有建设性的过程。

172
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.356
Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing
我们将沉浸式虚拟现实与图像处理结合起来，

173
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.356
to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions
模拟我们体验中相当强烈的

174
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.716
on experience.
感知预测。

175
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.636
In this panoramic video, we've transformed the world --
在这段全景影像中， 我们重塑了世界——

176
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.556
which is in this case Sussex campus --
我们把苏塞克斯校园

177
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.140
into a psychedelic playground.
变为一个迷幻的游乐场。

178
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.436
We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream
我们用谷歌的“深层梦想”的算法 处理了这段视频

179
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.556
to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions.
来模拟我们在 相当强烈的感知预测下的真实体验。

180
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.196
In this case, to see dogs.
在这种情况下，我们看到了狗狗。

181
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.356
And you can see this is a very strange thing.
你可以看到这些很奇怪。

182
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.476
When perceptual predictions are too strong,
当感知预测太过强烈，

183
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.876
as they are here,
正如这一案例中，

184
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.796
the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations
画面看起来就像是幻觉。

185
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.836
people might report in altered states,
人们看起来像是变形的状态，

186
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.940
or perhaps even in psychosis.
甚至像患有精神病一样。

187
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.607
Now, think about this for a minute.
让我们想一想。

188
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.076
If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception,
如果幻觉是一种不可控的感知，

189
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.556
then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination,
那么我们此时此刻的感知 也恰是一种幻觉，

190
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.596
but a controlled hallucination
但如果幻觉可控

191
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.516
in which the brain's predictions are being reined in
那么大脑的预测将由

192
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.420
by sensory information from the world.
从外界获取的感官信息所主宰。

193
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.996
In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time,
事实上， 我们一直都在幻想，

194
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.390
including right now.
包括现在。

195
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.236
It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations,
只是当我们认同我们的幻觉时，

196
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.460
we call that reality.
我们称之为现实。

197
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.036
(Laughter)
（笑声）

198
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.396
Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self,
接下来，我要告诉你们 作为自我的体验，

199
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.236
the specific experience of being you,
成为你自己的特定体验。

200
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.756
is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.
也是一种大脑产生的可控幻觉。

201
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.796
This seems a very strange idea, right?
这听起来很奇怪，对吧？

202
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.956
Yes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes,
没错，视觉错觉可能会欺骗我们的眼睛，

203
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.500
but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?
但我怎么可能会能被自我存在的意义所骗呢？

204
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.236
For most of us,
对于大多数人而言

205
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.836
the experience of being a person
“作为人”的体验

206
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.956
is so familiar, so unified and so continuous
是如此的熟悉、统一、 并且从不间断，

207
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.196
that it's difficult not to take it for granted.
所以它也极易被忽视。

208
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.036
But we shouldn't take it for granted.
但我们不应视之为理所当然。

209
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.276
There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.
有很多方式可以体验自我。

210
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.396
There's the experience of having a body
我们可以体验拥有一个身体

211
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.876
and of being a body.
掌控这个身体。

212
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.036
There are experiences of perceiving the world
我们可以体验以第一视角

213
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.700
from a first person point of view.
来认知这个世界。

214
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.276
There are experiences of intending to do things
我们可以体验试着去做某事

215
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.020
and of being the cause of things that happen in the world.
或是成为世上发生的事情的缘由。

216
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.716
And there are experiences
我们还可以体验

217
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.636
of being a continuous and distinctive person over time,
随着时间流逝， 基于丰富的记忆及社会相互作用

218
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.500
built from a rich set of memories and social interactions.
我们仍是一个与众不同的人。

219
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.316
Many experiments show,
许多实验表明，

220
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.676
and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well,
精神病学家和神经学家其实非常了解

221
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.596
that these different ways in which we experience being a self
我们体验自我的这些不同的方式

222
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.316
can all come apart.
是相互独立的。

223
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.236
What this means is the basic background experience
这意味着 对于大脑而言

224
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.836
of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.
成为一个统一的自我的体验是很脆弱的。

225
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.516
Another experience, which just like all others,
另一个与之相似的体验

226
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.740
requires explanation.
需要进一步解释。

227
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.316
So let's return to the bodily self.
让我们先回到身体本身。

228
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.076
How does the brain generate the experience of being a body
大脑是如何产生成为一个身体的体验的？

229
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.356
and of having a body?
或者说拥有一个身体？

230
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.236
Well, just the same principles apply.
之前的原理同样适用。

231
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.716
The brain makes its best guess
大脑做出了它的最佳推测，

232
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.940
about what is and what is not part of its body.
关于哪一部分属于身体，哪一部分不属于。

233
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.436
And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.
神经科学里有一个很棒的实验 可以说明这一点。

234
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.436
And unlike most neuroscience experiments,
与大多数神经科学试验不同，

235
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.956
this is one you can do at home.
这一试验你在家里就可以进行。

236
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.876
All you need is one of these.
你只需要这个。

237
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.156
(Laughter)
（笑声）

238
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.620
And a couple of paintbrushes.
再准备一些画笔。

239
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.076
In the rubber hand illusion,
我们将测试者的一只真手遮盖起来，

240
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.076
a person's real hand is hidden from view,
取而代之的是这只橡胶手，

241
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.716
and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.
将橡胶手放在人们面前。

242
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.996
Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush
让人们注视着假手

243
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.700
while the person stares at the fake hand.
然后用画笔同时轻触两只手。

244
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.116
Now, for most people, after a while,
对大多数人来说，只需很短的时间，

245
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.236
this leads to the very uncanny sensation
就会有不可思议的感觉，

246
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.860
that the fake hand is in fact part of their body.
你会感到假手成为了身体的一部分。

247
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.636
And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch
视觉触摸和感知触摸叠合在了一起

248
00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.036
on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be,
看起来就像是假手所在的地方大致就是手的位置，

249
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.836
is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess
这足以让大脑做出它的最佳推测

250
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.076
that the fake hand is in fact part of the body.
认为假手就是身体的一部分。

251
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.700
(Laughter)
（笑声）

252
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.316
So you can measure all kinds of clever things.
你可能懂得很多原理，

253
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.636
You can measure skin conductance and startle responses,
包括皮肤传导，惊吓反应，

254
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.916
but there's no need.
但其实没什么必要。

255
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.876
It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand.
显而易见身着蓝衣的测试者 真的将假手视为了自己身体的一部分。

256
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.316
This means that even experiences of what our body is
这意味着，即使是我们对自己身体的认知

257
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.876
is a kind of best guessing --
都只是一种最佳猜测——

258
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.380
a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain.
一种可控的大脑幻觉。

259
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.500
There's one more thing.
还有一点。

260
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.596
We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside,
我们不只是单纯地从外界 认知我们的身体，

261
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.356
we also experience them from within.
我们也从本身来感受。

262
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.620
We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.
我们都从本身去感知、体验过身体。

263
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.396
And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body
这些感觉信号都由身体自身产生，

264
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.476
are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs,
它们不断向大脑汇报 身体内器官的状况，

265
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.156
how the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like,
比如心脏是如何跳动的 血压是怎样的，

266
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.396
lots of things.
等等。

267
00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.900
This kind of perception, which we call interoception,
这一类型的感知 我们称之为“内感”，

268
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.916
is rather overlooked.
常常被我们忽视，

269
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.356
But it's critically important
但它们却异常重要。

270
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.716
because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body --
因为对于体内状况的感知和规律的了解

271
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.340
well, that's what keeps us alive.
是使我们活着的条件。

272
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.636
Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion.
还有另一种橡胶手错觉。

273
00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.156
This is from our lab at Sussex.
这是我们苏塞克斯大学实验室的试验。

274
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.596
And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand,
人们看着他们虚拟现实中的手，

275
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.996
which flashes red and back
闪烁着红色，

276
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.270
either in time or out of time with their heartbeat.
闪烁频率和心率一致或是不同。

277
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.756
And when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat,
当闪烁频率和心率一致时，

278
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.900
people have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.
人们会强烈地感到这是他们身体的一部分。

279
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.036
So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded
所以当我们从内感知我们的身体时

280
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.460
in perceiving our bodies from within.
可以强烈地感到拥有一个身体。

281
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.156
There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to,
最后我想要你们注意，

282
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.836
which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different
从内感知身体

283
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.916
from experiences of the world around us.
远不同于从外感知

284
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.636
When I look around me, the world seems full of objects --
当我看着周围的事物时， 这个世界充斥着各种各样的东西——

285
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.836
tables, chairs, rubber hands,
桌子，椅子，橡胶手，

286
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.596
people, you lot --
人们，在座的各位——

287
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.596
even my own body in the world,
甚至包括我自己的身体，

288
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.876
I can perceive it as an object from the outside.
我可以感知到它们是外界的一个物体。

289
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.956
But my experiences of the body from within,
但我的内在感知，

290
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.396
they're not like that at all.
却完全不同。

291
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.476
I don't perceive my kidneys here,
我没有在这儿感知到我的肾脏，

292
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.076
my liver here,
我在这儿的肝脏，

293
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.356
my spleen ...
我的脾脏

294
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.276
I don't know where my spleen is,
我也不知道我的脾脏在哪里，

295
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.676
but it's somewhere.
但它就在某处。

296
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.596
I don't perceive my insides as objects.
我不认为我的身体内部的东西是物体。

297
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.260
In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.
实际上，除非他们病了 我是不会感觉到它们存在的。

298
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.700
And this is important, I think.
我认为这很重要。

299
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.516
Perception of the internal state of the body
对于机体内部状况的认知

300
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.396
isn't about figuring out what's there,
并不是弄明白它们在哪儿，

301
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.556
it's about control and regulation --
而是控制和调节——

302
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.476
keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds
将生理参数保持在

303
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.340
that are compatible with survival.
与生存相适应的范围内。

304
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.316
When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there,
当大脑用预测判断那是什么的时候，

305
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.436
we perceive objects as the causes of sensations.
我们感觉物体就是感觉的起因。

306
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.076
When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things,
当大脑用预测控制和调节事物时

307
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.260
we experience how well or how badly that control is going.
我们可以感知到控制的好与坏。

308
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.516
So our most basic experiences of being a self,
所以我们最基本的自我体验，

309
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.596
of being an embodied organism,
作为一个具体的有机体的体验，

310
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.580
are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
深深扎根于维持我们生存的生物机制中。

311
00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.916
And when we follow this idea all the way through,
当我们一路追寻个中原理，

312
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.636
we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences,
我们会发现 我们所有的意识体验，

313
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.396
since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception,
都依赖于相同的预测感知机制，

314
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.836
all stem from this basic drive to stay alive.
因为这一基本的驱动力 我们才能活着。

315
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.476
We experience the world and ourselves
通过活着，也正是因为活着

316
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.580
with, through and because of our living bodies.
我们才能感受世界和我们自己。

317
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.780
Let me bring things together step-by-step.
让我们一步一步来分析一下。

318
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.956
What we consciously see depends
我们有意识看到的东西

319
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.276
on the brain's best guess of what's out there.
是基于大脑对外界事物的最佳猜测。

320
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.676
Our experienced world comes from the inside out,
我们对世界的体验也会由内而外产生，

321
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.940
not just the outside in.
并不只是由外到内的。

322
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.676
The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences
橡胶手错觉表明 这适用于我们对什么是

323
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.540
of what is and what is not our body.
以及什么不是我们自己身体的体验。

324
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.956
And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals
这些与自我相关的预测主要依赖于

325
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.740
coming from deep inside the body.
来自身体深处的感官信号。

326
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.436
And finally,
最后，

327
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.836
experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation
作为一个具体化的自我的体验 更多的是关于控制和调节，

328
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.540
than figuring out what's there.
而不是去弄清楚到底是什么。

329
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.876
So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it --
所以我们对外界事物及我们自己的感知，

330
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.156
well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations
都是可控的幻觉，

331
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.076
that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution
数百万年的进化形成了这些幻觉，

332
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.860
to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.
让我们能存活在这充满机遇和挑战的世界中。

333
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.980
We predict ourselves into existence.
我们推测我们是存在的。

334
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.820
Now, I leave you with three implications of all this.
现在我给大家三个启示。

335
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.676
First, just as we can misperceive the world,
第一，就像我们会误解世界一样，

336
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.476
we can misperceive ourselves
当预测机制出错时

337
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.636
when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.
我们也会误解自我。

338
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.876
Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,
了解这点会在精神病学和神经学方面 挖掘出更多新的发现，

339
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.516
because we can finally get at the mechanisms
因为我们终于可以深入其中的机制

340
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.436
rather than just treating the symptoms
而不仅仅局限于治疗

341
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.980
in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.
抑郁症和精神分裂症的症状。

342
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.756
Second:
第二：

343
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.596
what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to
“成为自我”的意识

344
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.990
a software program running on a robot,
不能被上传到控制机器人的软件程序里，

345
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.236
however smart or sophisticated.
无论它多聪明，多精密也不行。

346
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.876
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals
我们是有血有肉的生物体，

347
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.156
whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels
我们的意识感知经由不同的层次塑造，

348
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.156
by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
我们凭借生物机制活着。

349
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.820
Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.
即使电脑更加智能 它们也不会有知觉。

350
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.116
Finally,
最后，

351
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.116
our own individual inner universe,
我们内在的小宇宙，

352
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.796
our way of being conscious,
我们人类存在意识的方式，

353
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.580
is just one possible way of being conscious.
只是存在意识的其中一种方式。

354
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.636
And even human consciousness generally --
即使人们普遍都存在意识，

355
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.636
it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.
在有意识的广阔空间里， 它也只是一个很小的区域。

356
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.316
Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us,
自我和世界对我们每个人而言都是独一无二的，

357
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.556
but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms
但它们都以生物机制为基础，

358
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.180
shared with many other living creatures.
所以同样也适用于其它生物体。

359
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.700
Now, these are fundamental changes
如今，我们对于“如何理解自我”

360
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.836
in how we understand ourselves,
有了根本性的改变，

361
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.716
but I think they should be celebrated,
我想这是值得庆祝的事情，

362
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.116
because as so often in science, from Copernicus --
因为科学界经常引用哥白尼的一句话：

363
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.140
we're not at the center of the universe --
我们不是宇宙的中心。

364
00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:23.396
to Darwin --
达尔文也说过：

365
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.636
we're related to all other creatures --
万物皆相关，

366
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.860
to the present day.
直至今日。

367
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.876
With a greater sense of understanding
我们有更强的理解力，

368
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.316
comes a greater sense of wonder,
更大的惊奇感，

369
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.196
and a greater realization
更好的认知力，

370
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.820
that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.
我们知道我们属于自然界的一部分， 密不可分。

371
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.940
And ...
而且······

372
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.916
when the end of consciousness comes,
当我们失去意识时，

373
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.740
there's nothing to be afraid of.
也无需害怕些什么。

374
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.580
Nothing at all.
根本没什么。

375
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.516
Thank you.
谢谢。

376
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:59.566
(Applause)
