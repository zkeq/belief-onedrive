We were to be below the radar,

Somehow they find their way to you.

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:56.390
as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,

152
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.004
and maybe Bageye did with his father.

153
00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:00.646
And that was clearer to me
在我研究我父亲生活的过程中，

154
00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:03.604
in the course of looking at his life
我对这一点的理解越来越清晰，

155
00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:06.660
and understanding, as they say,

156

the Native Americans say,

170

is not true.

They determined that they would send me to a private school,

my father, that's not his car by the way.

He would promote the policeman immediately,

it was my mother who fathered me.

257
00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:40.901
"Black people are schooled in paranoia."

258
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:44.772
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.

Now I also had a 10-year-old son,

When the book came out,

it had fair reviews in the national papers,
