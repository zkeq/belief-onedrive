(Applause)
（掌声）

31
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.156
At this point, most people really only care about the television show.
这时候，大部分人其实都只关心那部电视剧。

32
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.860
(Laughter)
（笑声）

33
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.060
I know this from experience.

And I played Weasel Wyzell,

Now, did you struggle with number four, my blindness?

Why is that?

42
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.076
We make assumptions about so-called disabilities.

As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions

44
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.060
about my abilities every day.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.996
My point today is not about my blindness, however.
然而，我今天的重点不在于我的失明。

46
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.220
It's about my vision.

47
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.100
Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open.
失明教会我用开阔的眼界去生活。

48
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.396

49
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.916
that our minds create.
我们内心创造出来的鱼。

50
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.100

51
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.660
What does it feel like to see?
看得见是怎么样的一种感觉？

52
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.180
It's immediate and passive.

53
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.756
You open your eyes and there's the world.
你睁开双眼，世界就在你眼前。

54
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.876
Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.100
Right?

Well, that's what I thought.

Then, from age 12 to 25, my retinas progressively deteriorated.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.020
was really a mannequin.

62
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.196
Reaching down to wash my hands,

63
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.436
I suddenly saw it was a urinal I was touching, not a sink,

64
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.175
when my fingers felt its true shape.

65
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.116
A friend described the photograph in my hand,

and only then I could see the image depicted.

It was difficult and exhausting to see.
看见成为了一件困难的使我筋疲力尽的事情。

69
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.676
I pieced together fragmented, transitory images,

70
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.676
consciously analyzed the clues,
凭感觉分析线索，

71
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.780
searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope,

72
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.946
until I saw nothing at all.

73
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.076
I learned that what we see
我认识到我们所看到的

74
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.460
is not universal truth.
并不即是普遍真理。

75
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.220
It is not objective reality.
并不是客观现实。

76
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.516
What we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality

77
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.660
that is masterfully constructed by our brain.
它是由我们的大脑巧妙地构造出来的。

78
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.714
Let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience.
请让我以外行的身份解释一遍神经系统学。

79
00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:12.978
Your visual cortex takes up about 30 percent of your brain.
你的视觉皮层占据了你脑部的大概30%。

80
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.836
That's compared to approximately eight percent for touch
相比于触觉的8%

81
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.660
and two to three percent for hearing.
以及听觉的2-3%。

82
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.156
Every second, your eyes can send your visual cortex
每一秒钟，你的双眼能够 向你的视觉皮层传达

83
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.340
as many as two billion pieces of information.
多达二十亿的信息片段。

84
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.620
The rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion.
其余的身体部分加起来也仅能够传达另外的十亿。

85
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.716
So sight is one third of your brain by volume
所以视觉占据了你脑部容量的三分之一

86
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.060
and can claim about two thirds of your brain's processing resources.
并且占用了你脑部中三分之二的信息处理资源。

87
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.076
It's no surprise then
因此意想得到的是

88
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.196
that the illusion of sight is so compelling.
视觉幻象是多么的令人信服。

89
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.620
But make no mistake about it: sight is an illusion.
但是别误会了： 我们所看到的只是一种幻象。

90
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.556
Here's where it gets interesting.
这是事情变得有趣的地方。

91
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.676
To create the experience of sight,
为了制造视觉经验，

92
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.236
your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world,
你的大脑参考了你对这个世界的概念性理解，

93
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.316
other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention.
其它知识、你的记忆、 看法、情绪和心理关注。

94
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.900
All of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight.
所有的这些东西和以及其它的 都连结于你的大脑和视觉景象之间。

95
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.276
These linkages work both ways, and usually occur subconsciously.
这些连结是双向作用的， 并且常常在潜意识中发生。

96
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.156
So for example,
举例子来说，

97
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.316
what you see impacts how you feel,
你所看到的会影响到你的感觉，

98
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.940
and the way you feel can literally change what you see.
而你的感觉又能够直接改变你所看到的。

99
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.580
Numerous studies demonstrate this.
许多的研究证明了这一点。

100
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.276
If you are asked to estimate
如果你被要求去估计

101
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.476
the walking speed of a man in a video, for example,
视频中人物的行走速度，举例来说，

102
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.620
your answer will be different if you're told to think about cheetahs or turtles.
在被告知去想着猎豹或者乌龟的情况下， 你的答案将会不一样。

103
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.236
A hill appears steeper if you've just exercised,
如果你刚刚运动完，你会感觉山变陡峭了，

104
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.476
and a landmark appears farther away

105
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.180
if you're wearing a heavy backpack.
眼前的目的地看起来距离更远。

106
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.660
We have arrived at a fundamental contradiction.
我们在这里遇到了一种基本的矛盾。

107
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.396
What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making,
你肉眼所看到的东西 是你自己创造的一种复杂的心智建造，

108
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.196
but you experience it passively
但是你被动地经历着它

109
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.620
as a direct representation of the world around you.
让它作为你周遭世界的一种直接呈现。

110
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.100
You create your own reality, and you believe it.

111
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.620
I believed mine until it broke apart.

112
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.180
The deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion.
我双眼的衰退粉碎了这种幻象。

113
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.836
You see, sight is just one way
你看，视觉只是我们

114
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.540
we shape our reality.
认识世界的一种途径。

115
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.700
We create our own realities in many other ways.
我们可以通过许多其它的方式 去创造属于我们自己的现实。

116
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.940
Let's take fear as just one example.
让我们来举恐惧作为一个例子。

117
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.100
Your fears distort your reality.
你的恐惧扭曲了你的现实。

118
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.876
Under the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain.

119
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.356
Fear fills the void at all costs,

122
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.100
substituting assumption for reason.
使假设代替了原因。

123
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.676
Psychologists have a great term for it: awfulizing.
心理学家对此有一个 很好的术语：往坏处想。

124
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.796
(Laughter)
（笑声）

125
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.356
Right?

Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.
