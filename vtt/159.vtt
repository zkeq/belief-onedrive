00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.436
When I was a kid, my parents would tell me,
当我还是个孩子时， 我父母告诉我，

2
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.859
"You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."
“你可以把东西搞得一团糟， 但是之后你必须收拾好。”

3
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.596
So freedom came with responsibility.
所以自由和责任其实是伴随发生的。

4
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.196
But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places,
我的想象力会把我带到 一个什么都可以发生的，

5
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.316
where everything was possible.
神奇的地方。

6
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.236
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --
我在一个充满天真的世界中成长——

7
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.596
or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,
或者应该说是一个无知的世界，

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.716
because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.
因为大人们会对我们说谎， 来避免我们接触到丑恶的现实。

9
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.316
And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess,
当我们逐渐长大，我发现 其实大人们的世界一团糟，

10
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.140
and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.
而且他们并不善于收拾烂摊子。

11
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.316
Fast forward, I am an adult now,
现在，我变成了个大人，

12
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.316
and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School.
我在香港港口小学教科学和发明课。

13
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.676
And it doesn't take too long
没过多久，

14
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.916
before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash.
我的学生们走在海滩上的时候， 就发现了成堆的垃圾。

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.596
So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches --
作为好公民，我们清理了海滩——

16
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.340
and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.
不，他不是在喝酒， 就算是，酒也不是我给的。

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.460
(Laughter)
（笑声）

18
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.996
And so it's sad to say,
很遗憾地说，

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.796
but today more than 80 percent  of the oceans have plastic in them.
如今超过80%的海洋里有塑料制品。

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.100
It's a horrifying fact.
这是个很可怕的事实。

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.996
And in past decades,
在过去的几十年里，

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.476
we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets,
我们用这些大船拖着大网把垃圾捞出来，

23
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.836
and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope,
我们把塑料垃圾收集起来， 用显微镜观察，

24
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.076
and we sort them,
然后把它们分类，

25
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.862
and then we put this data onto a map.
之后我们把这些数据写在了一张地图上。

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.596
But that takes forever, it's very expensive,
但那要花很长时间，成本也非常高，

27
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.756
and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
而且开那些大船是很危险的。

28
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.716
So with my students, ages six to 15,
所以我，和我的6到15岁的学生们，

29
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.956
we've been dreaming of inventing a better way.
一直都梦想创造一个更好的办法。

30
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.396
So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
于是，我们把在香港的 一个小教室变成了一个工作室。

31
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.076
And so we started building this small workbench,
然后我们就开始建造这个小工作台，

32
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.276
with different heights, so even really short kids can participate.
把它们做成不同的高度，就算是个子矮的 小朋友也可以参加进来了。

33
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.476
And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
告诉你们吧，拿着电动工具的孩子们 其实很酷炫而且很安全。

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.836
(Laughter)
（笑声）

35
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.756
Not really.
开个玩笑。

36
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.996
And so, back to plastic.
咱们回到塑料制品那个话题。

37
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.636
We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean,
我们收集了一些塑料制品然后把它们 磨成了在海里找到它们时的大小，

38
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.836
which is very small because it breaks down.
特别特别小，因为它们在海里都分解了。

39
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.236
And so this is how we work.
我们是这么做的。

40
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.396
I let the imaginations of my students run wild.
我让我的学生们充分发挥想象力。

41
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.676
And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea
而我的工作就是尽量收集 每个孩子最好的想法，

42
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.980
and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
然后试着去把这些想法和一些 期望能行的通的东西结合起来。

43
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.876
And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits,
之后我们就达成了一致， 我们不收集塑料品了，

44
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.876
we are going to collect only the data.
我们决定仅仅收集数据。

45
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.876
So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot --
我们打算用机器人来获取 塑料制品的图片——

46
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.276
so robots, kids get very excited.
有了机器人，孩子们简直兴奋死了。

47
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.443
And the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping."
我们的下一步工作—— 我们称之为“快速原型设计”。

48
00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:33.156
We are so rapid at prototyping
我们的原型设计做得非常快，

49
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.356
that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
以至于我们午饭还没吃完， 饭盒就被征用了。

50
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.676
(Laughter)
（笑声）

51
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.956
And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures
我们把桌灯和网络摄像头 装到了卫生洁具上，

52
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.116
and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water
然后把它们组装在漂浮机器人上， 机器人会在水面上缓缓移动，

53
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.236
and through the plastic that we have there --
穿过水面上的塑料漂浮物——

54
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.451
and this is the image that we get in the robot.
这就是我们用机器人得到的照片。

55
00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:55.196
So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor,
我们可以看到塑料碎片缓缓地 流经感应器，

56
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.516
and the computer on board will process this image,
内置的计算机就会分析这些影像，

57
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.636
and measure the size of each particle,
并且计算出每个颗粒的大小，

58
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.780
so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
所以我们就能对水中塑料品的数量 有一个粗略的估计了。

59
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.356
So we documented this invention step by step
我们在一个叫Instructables的 发明家网站上

60
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.756
on a website for inventors called Instructables,
一步一步地记录下我们的发明，

61
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.580
in the hope that somebody would make it even better.
希望有人可以继续完善它。

62
00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:19.516
What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem,
这个项目的精彩之处在于， 孩子们自己看到了当地的问题，

63
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.207
and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it.
然后灵光一现——他们就马上开始 试着去解决这个问题了。

64
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:24.556
[I can investigate my local problem]
（我可以研究本地的问题）

65
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.770
But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.
不过，我在香港的学生是 非常与时俱进的孩子。

66
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.116
And they watch the news, they watch the Internet,
他们常看新闻， 他们会上网，

67
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.380
and they came across this image.
然后他们就看到了这张照片。

68
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.396
This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,
这是一个大概不到10岁的孩子， 在徒手清理流出的油污，

69
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.916
in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
地点在孟加拉国，拥有世界最大的 红树林的孙德尔本斯地区。

70
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.396
So they were very shocked,
孩子们感到非常震惊，

71
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.716
because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in,
因为这里的水就是当地人喝的水， 他们也常在这里洗澡，

72
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.116
this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live.
在这里钓鱼—— 这是他们赖以生存的地方。

73
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.036
And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown,
现在你们可以看到水是棕色的， 泥土是棕色的，油污也是棕色的，

74
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.537
so when everything is mixed up,
当所有的东西都掺在一起时，

75
00:03:57.561 --> 00:04:00.036
it's really hard to see what's in the water.
很难分清水里有什么东西。

76
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.316
But, there's a technology that's rather simple,
但是，有一项相当简单的技术，

77
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.876
that's called spectrometry,
叫做光谱测定法，

78
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.805
that allows you see what's in the water.
可以让你看清水中物质的成分。

79
00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.876
So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer,
所以我们就做了一个分光仪的 简单原型，

80
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.836
and you can shine light through different substances
让光线透过不同的物质，

81
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.276
that produce different spectrums,
产生不同的光谱，

82
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.156
so that can help you identify what's in the water.
这样就能帮你分辨水里的东西了。

83
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.076
So we packed this prototype of a sensor,
我们就把这个感应器的原型打包好，

84
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.340
and we shipped it to Bangladesh.
寄到了孟加拉国。

85
00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:25.476
So what was cool about this project
这个项目有意思的地方在于

86
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.635
was that beyond addressing a local problem,
这不只是解决一个本地问题，

87
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.089
or looking at a local problem,
或者研究一个本地问题了，

88
00:04:30.113 --> 00:04:34.036
my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative
我的学生们用他们的同情心 和丰富的想象力

89
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.316
to help, remotely, other kids.
远程帮助了其他的孩子。

90
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.055
[I can investigate a remote problem]
（我可以解决一个远方的问题了）

91
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.699
So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments,
我做第二个实验时有一种 很强的使命感，

92
00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:43.236
and I wanted to take it even further --
想要更进一步——

93
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.860
maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
或许我们可以解决一个更加困难， 同时也是我打心底里想研究的问题。

94
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.996
So I'm half Japanese and half French,
我是日法混血，

95
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.340
and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
可能你们还记得在2011年 日本遭受了一次很强的地震。

96
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.756
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves --
地震破坏力很强，还引发了惊天巨浪——

97
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.196
they are called tsunami --
也就是海啸——

98
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.180
and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
海啸破坏了日本东边沿海地区的 很多城市。

99
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.860
More than 14,000 people died in an instant.
一瞬间，超过一万四千人失去了生命。

100
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.156
Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima,
而且，海啸还摧毁了福田核电站，

101
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.860
the nuclear power plant just by the water.
一个建在海边的核电站。

102
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.716
And today, I read the reports
今天，我读了一些报告，

103
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.796
and an average of 300 tons
知道了大概300吨的核污水

104
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.396
are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
从核电站流到了太平洋。

105
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.796
And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
今天，整个太平洋都 受到了铯-137的污染。

106
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.236
If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
如果你去美国的西海岸， 到处都能够发现福岛核泄露的痕迹。

107
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.556
But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity
但如果你从地图上看， 你会看到似乎大部分的放射物质

108
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.676
has been washed away from the Japanese coast,
都从日本海岸冲走了，

109
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.516
and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
现在核泄露的大部分—— 看起来都是安全的，因为是蓝色的。

110
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.956
Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
然而，现实要比这复杂得多。

111
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.636
So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident,
自从那次事故以来，我每年都会去福岛，

112
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.196
and I measure independently and with other scientists,
我和其他的科学家一起， 在陆地上、在水里

113
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.076
on land, in the river --
进行独立调查——

114
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.836
and this time we wanted to take the kids.
这次我想带上孩子们。

115
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.636
So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
当然我们没有真的把孩子们带过去， 家长们不会让我们这样做的。

116
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.996
(Laughter)
（笑声）

117
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.950
But every night we would report to "Mission Control" --
但每晚我们都要向“任务控制部”汇报，

118
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.156
different masks they're wearing.
他们带着不同的面具。

119
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.556
It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did
看起来好像他们并没有认真工作， 但其实不然，

120
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.780
because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.
因为他们一辈子都要在这种 放射性的环境下生活。

121
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.516
And so what we did with them
我们跟他们一起做的工作

122
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.156
is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day,
就是研究我们当天收集的数据，

123
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.371
and talk about where we should be going next --
并且讨论我们下一步该做什么——

124
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:34.516
strategy, itinerary, etc...
策略、行程等等······

125
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.156
And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map
于是，我们做了一个 核电站周围区域的

126
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.036
of the region around the nuclear power plant.
很简单的地形图。

127
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.076
And so we built the elevation map,
我们做了这个高程图，

128
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.716
we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity,
在上面撒上颜料 来代表核放射的实时数据，

129
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.076
and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.
我们还会喷水来模拟下雨。

130
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.076
And with this we could see that the radioactive dust
用这种方法我们看到了放射性尘埃

131
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.156
was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system,
被雨水从山顶冲到了河流里，

132
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.716
and leaking into the ocean.
最后流向大海。

133
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.340
So it was a rough estimate.
这只是个粗略的估算。

134
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.436
But with this in mind, we organized this expedition,
基于这种方法， 我们组织了一次探索活动，

135
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.076
which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.
这也是公民们距离核电站 最近的一次了。

136
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.436
We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant,

and with the help of the local fisherman,
在当地渔民的帮助下，

138
00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:17.676
we are collecting sediment from the seabed

142
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.676
that we send to different universities,
寄给了很多大学，

143
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.676
and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity,

144
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.236
especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce,

You can see a progression here --

149
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.916
we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.

with also very simple, open-source technologies.

152
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.836
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating

153
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.556
because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.
因为我们现在做的仅仅是测量 我们过去所造成的危害。

154
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.660
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.

155
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.236
And so I wonder if we should just take a leap

and try to invent better ways to do all these things.

157
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.916
And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small,
然后教室就显得有点小了，

158
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.636
so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong,
我们找了香港的一处废弃工厂，

159
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.916
and we turned it into the largest mega-space

160
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.116
focused on social and environmental impact.

163
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.326
a bit of biology, a bit of optics,

164
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.842
basically you can build pretty much everything there.

170
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.955
Cesar Harada: We're asking questions such as,
塞萨尔·原田： 我们经常提出这样的问题，

171
00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:52.796
can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.436
Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population
还有，我们能把非常常见的轮椅 变成很酷的电动车，

174
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.860
by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?
让老年人的行动更加方便吗？

175
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:11.596
So plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies,
塑料制品、油污和核辐射 都是非常非常可怕的残留物，

176
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.140
but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.
但是最最可怕的 还是我们对孩子们说的谎话。

178
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.740
because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.

So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers --

180
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.236
we must prepare the next generation
