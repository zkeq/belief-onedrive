1
00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:17.808
It's said that to be a poet
有人说如果你想要成为诗人

2
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.373
you have to go to hell and back.
你就必须去一趟地狱然后回来

3
00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:27.169
The first time I visited the prison,
当我第一次参观监狱时

4
00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.845
I was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks,
那里的枷锁和牢门关闭的声音

5
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:36.063
or the closing doors, or the cell bars,
狱室的栏杆和我之前想象出的各种恐怖东西

6
00:00:36.063 --> 00:00:40.066
or by any of the things I had imagined.
都没有吓到我

7
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:45.379
Maybe because the prison is in a quite open space.
也许是因为那个监狱是在一个比较开阔的地方

8
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.509
You can see the sky.
抬头就是天空

9
00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.152
Seagulls fly overhead, and you feel like you're next to the sea,
海鸥在头顶飞翔你会感觉大海就在附近

10
00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:54.195
that you're really close to the beach.
沙滩就在附近

11
00:00:54.195 --> 00:01:00.125
But in fact, the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison.
但是实际上那些海鸥是在监狱旁边的垃圾堆里寻找食物

12
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.041
I went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors.
我继续往里面走突然看到囚犯们在走廊里走动

13
00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:11.786
Then it was as if I stepped back and thought
我停下脚步陷入了思考

14
00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:15.595
that I could have very well been one of them.
我也有可能成为他们中的一员

15
00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:21.342
If I had another story, another context, different luck.
如果我的人生是另一个故事另一种境遇不同的缘分

16
00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:27.779
Because nobody - nobody - can choose where they're born.
因为没有人能够选择他们的出身

17
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.273
In 2009, I was invited to join a project
2009年，我应邀参加了一个项目

18
00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:42.900
that San Martín National University conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary, to coordinate a writing workshop.
圣·马丁国立大学在第48教养所举办了一个写作班

19
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.345
The prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison,
狱方在监狱的尽头划了一片地

20
00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:54.977
which is where they constructed the University Center building.
在那里修建了大学中心的建筑

21
00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.390
The first time I met with the prisoners,
我第一次和那些囚犯见面时

22
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.065
I asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop
我问他们为什么要参加写作班

23
00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:09.647
and they told me they wanted  to put on paper all that they couldn't say and do.
他们说要把那些不能说与不能做的事都写在纸上

24
00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:15.749
Right then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison.
那一刻 我决定把诗引入监狱

25
00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:20.858
So I said to them why don't we work with poetry,
于是我跟他们说为什么我们不写诗

26
00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:22.600
if they knew what poetry was.
如果他们知道诗是什么

27
00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:28.087
But nobody had a clue what poetry really was.
但是没有人清楚诗到底是什么

28
00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.076
They also suggested to me
他们还给我建议

29
00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:34.595
that the workshop should be not just for the inmates
写作班不应该只面向参加大学课程的囚犯

30
00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:39.851
taking university classes,  but for all the inmates.
而应该面向所有囚犯

31
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:43.628
And so I said that to start this workshop,
于是我说如果要办这个写作班

32
00:02:43.628 --> 00:02:47.470
I needed to find a tool that we all had in common.
我需要找到一个我们都有的工具

33
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.576
That tool was language.
这个工具就是语言

34
00:02:50.576 --> 00:02:56.768
We had language, we had the workshop. We could have poetry.
我们有语言有这个写作班就应当可以写诗

35
00:02:56.768 --> 00:03:02.594
But what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison, too.
但是我没有想到监狱里面也存在着不平等

36
00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:07.715
Many of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school.
很多囚犯连语法都没学过

37
00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:13.095
Many couldn't use cursive, could barely print.
很多人不会手写体连写印刷体也很困难

38
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.902
They didn't write fluently, either.
他们写的也不流畅

39
00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:23.513
So we started looking for short poems.
于是我们先从短篇诗开始

40
00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:26.579
Very short, but very powerful.
非常短 但是非常有力

41
00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.327
And we started to read, and we'd read one author, then another author,
然后我们开始阅读一位作家接着一位作家的读

42
00:03:30.327 --> 00:03:35.802
and by reading such short poems, they all began to realize
通过阅读这些短篇诗他们都开始意识到

43
00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:40.459
that what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic,
诗的语言能够打破一定的逻辑

44
00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.214
and create another system.
并且建立另一个系统

45
00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:45.808
Breaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system
诗在打破了语言的逻辑的同时也打破了

46
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:49.575
under which they've learned to respond.
他们早已适应的系统的逻辑

47
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.863
So a new system appeared,
于是一个新的系统诞生了

48
00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:59.022
new rules that made them understand very quickly,
新的规则让他们非常迅速

49
00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:00.901
- very quickly -
非常迅速地理解到

50
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:07.559
that with poetic language they would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted.
利用诗的语言他们可以说出想表达的一切

51
00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.390
It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back.
有人说要成为诗人就要到地狱去再回来

52
00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:21.794
And they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell.
这些囚犯的现实人生已然是地狱

53
00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:26.409
One of them once said: "In prison you never sleep.
一个囚犯说“在监狱无法睡觉

54
00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.274
You can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids."
“在监狱无法入眠无法合拢眼皮”

55
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:38.527
And so, like I’m doing now, I gave them a moment of silence,
于是就像我现在要做的我让他们保持片刻的安静

56
00:04:38.527 --> 00:04:43.249
then said, “That's what poetry is, you guys.
然后说 “这就是诗，各位”

57
00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.314
It's in this prison universe that you have all around you.
诗就在这所监狱中在你的周围

58
00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:51.594
Everything you say about how you never sleep,
你说的关于“无法入眠”的一切

59
00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:53.284
it exudes fear.
都散发着恐惧

60
00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:58.049
All the things that go unwritten -- all of that is poetry."
所有这一切没有写下来的全部都是诗

61
00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.496
So we started appropriating that hell;
于是我们开始借用这个地狱

62
00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:07.004
we plunged ourselves, headfirst, into the seventh circle.
我们将自己头朝下投入到第七圈地狱中

63
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:11.042
And in that seventh circle of hell, our very own, beloved circle,
而就在这第七圈地狱我们自己的钟爱的第七圈

64
00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:15.254
they learned that they could make the walls invisible,
他们发现自己可以让围墙消失

65
00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:17.424
that they could make the windows yell,
可以让窗户咆哮

66
00:05:17.424 --> 00:05:20.364
and that we could hide inside the shadows.
而我们可以躲在阴影里

67
00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:27.284
When the first year of the workshop had ended,
当第一年的写作班结束时

68
00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:29.692
we organized a little closing party,
我们开了一个小型的结课聚会

69
00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:33.382
like you do when a job is done with so much love,

70
00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:36.332
and you want to celebrate with a party.

71
00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:40.799
We called family, friends,  the university authorities.

72
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:45.141
The only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem,

73
00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:47.378
and receive their diplomas and applause.

74
00:05:47.378 --> 00:05:49.905
That was our simple party.

00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:56.824
The only thing I want to leave you with

76
00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:02.839

some of them just huge when standing next to me,

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:11.050
or the young boys - so young, but with an enormous pride,

79
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.893
held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated,
他们都拿着自己的纸颤抖得像小孩子，满身是汗

80
00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:22.107
and read their poems with their voices completely broken.

81
00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:27.829
That moment made me think a lot

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.886
that for most of them, it was surely the very first time

In prison, you can't dream. In prison, you can't cry.
在监狱里不能做梦，在监狱里不能哭喊

86
00:06:48.938 --> 00:06:53.967
There are words that are virtually forbidden, like the word "time,"

87
00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:58.836
the word "future," the word "wish".

We decided that they were going to write a book.

They had no idea such dignity could come from them.

At the workshop, in that beloved hell we share, we all give something.
在写作班上那个我们所爱的地狱中我们共同分享、给予

you're repairing that huge social fracture

from our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado:

“我需要一根无限长的线才能缝合这个巨大的伤口”

Poetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.

It creates a mirror, which is the poem.

and write from who they are, and are from what they write.

they need to appropriate the moment of writing

which is a moment of extraordinary freedom.

00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:23.918
They have to get into their heads, search for that bit of freedom

that can never be taken away when they write

blinded by that light,

136
00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:03.541
it hides the speed of existence
在那里画面划动而过的地方

137
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:05.694
where the images go rowing by.

rides on storms that spread fire,
