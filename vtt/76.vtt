00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:14.947
So the other morning I went to the grocery store
一天早上，我走进一家杂货店，

2
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:16.289
and an employee greeted me
店员跟我打招呼：

3
00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:19.010
with a "Good morning, sir, can I help you with anything?"
“早上好，先生，有什么可以帮您？”

4
00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:20.970
I said, "No, thanks, I'm good."
我说，“不用了，谢谢。”

5
00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.635
The person smiled and we went our separate ways.
他冲我笑了笑，然后我们就分开了。

6
00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:25.971
I grabbed Cheerios and I left the grocery store.
我拿了一盒麦片，离开了杂货店。

7
00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.730
And I went through the drive-through of a local coffee shop.
然后我去了一家本地 汽车穿梭咖啡厅。

8
00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.653
After I placed my order, the voice on the other end said,
下单之后，另一头的声音说，

9
00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:33.348
"Thank you, ma'am. Drive right around."
“谢谢您，女士。 请开到另一边。”

10
00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:35.152
Now, in the span of less than an hour,
在不到一个小时内，

11
00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.138
I was understood both as a "sir" and as a "ma'am."
我被人同时认作了 “先生”和“女士”。

12
00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.789
But for me, neither of these people are wrong,
对我而言，他们都没错，

13
00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:42.963
but they're also not completely right.
但是也不全对。

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.554
This cute little human is my almost-two-year-old Elliot.
这个可爱的小家伙 是我的埃利奥特，差不多2岁。

15
00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.332
Yeah, alright.
是的，可爱吧。

16
00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.720
And over the past two years,
在过去的2年里，

17
00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:53.751
this kid has forced me to rethink the world
这个小家伙让我重新思考世界

18
00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:55.251
and how I participate in it.
和如何生活。

19
00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:59.464
I identify as transgender and as a parent, that makes me a transparent.
我既是跨性别人，也是父亲， 所以我是“夸父”。

20
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.731
(Laughter)
（笑声）

21
00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.181
(Applause)
（掌声）

22
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.054
(Cheering)
（欢呼声）

23
00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:11.564
(Applause)
（掌声）

24
00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.168
As you can see, I took this year's theme super literal.
如您所见，我这一年 比夸父还累。

25
00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:16.253
(Laughter)
（笑声）

26
00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.372
Like any good dad joke should.
就像所有幽默的好父亲一样。

27
00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:21.746
More specifically, I identify as genderqueer.
具体来说，我是一名性别酷儿。

28
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.549
And there are lots of ways to experience being genderqueer,
性别酷儿有许多种行为方式，

29
00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:27.763
but for me that means I don't really identify as a man or a woman.
对我而言，它意味着 我不把自己认作男性或女性。

30
00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:30.944
I feel in between and sometimes outside of this gender binary.
我觉得自己处于两者之间， 有时又游离于两者之外。

31
00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.215
And being outside of this gender binary
游离在两者之外

32
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.580
means that sometimes I get "sired" and "ma'amed"
意味着我有时被认为是“先生”， 有时被认为是“女士”

33
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:38.763
in the span of less than an hour when I'm out doing everyday things
哪怕就在我日常生活中， 不到一个小时内，

34
00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.619
like getting Cheerios.
比如去买一盒麦片。

35
00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.541
But this in between lane is where I'm most comfortable.
但是这种位于两者之间的状态 是我感到最舒服的。

36
00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.819
This space where I can be both a sir and a ma'am
这种既可以是先生 又可以是女士的中间地带

37
00:01:43.953 --> 00:01:47.165
feels the most right and the most authentic.
是感觉最正确也最真实的。

38
00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.215
But it doesn't mean that these interactions aren't uncomfortable.
但这并不意味着 所有的互动都令人舒服。

39
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.818
Trust me, the discomfort can range from minor annoyance
相信我，这种不舒服的程度 会从小小的讨厌

40
00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:54.254
to feeling physically unsafe.
到感觉到危险。

41
00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:55.465
Like the time at a bar in college
有一次在大学的一个酒吧里，

42
00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:58.746
when a bouncer physically removed me by the back of the neck
一个门卫拎着我的脖子后面

43
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.645
and threw me out of a woman's restroom.
把我从女厕所里扔了出去。

44
00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.422
But for me, authenticity doesn't mean "comfortable."
对我而言，真实并不意味着“舒适”。

45
00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:06.550
It means managing and negotiating the discomfort of everyday life,
它意味着管理和解决 日常生活中的不舒适，

46
00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:08.056
even at times when it's unsafe.
哪怕有时候会有危险。

47
00:02:08.913 --> 00:02:11.311
And it wasn't until my experience as a trans person
直到我的跨性别身份

48
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.140
collided with my new identity as a parent
与我的父亲身份发生了碰撞，

49
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.666
that I understood the depth of my vulnerabilities
我才发现自己是多么脆弱，

50
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.779
and how they are preventing me from being my most authentic self.
这种脆弱会阻止我做最真实的自己。

51
00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:22.500
Now, for most people, what their child will call them
对大多数人而言，孩子怎么称呼自己，

52
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.723
is not something that they give much thought to
是一件不需要思考太多的事情，

53
00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.202
outside of culturally specific words
无非就是不同文化所用的词汇不同，

54
00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:30.062
or variations on a gendered theme like "mama," "mommy," or "daddy," "papa."
或者性别不同所以称呼不同， “妈妈”、“妈咪”，或者“爸爸”、“爹地”。

55
00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:32.490
But for me, the possibility is what this child,
但对我而言，一想到这个孩子

56
00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:35.428
who will grow to be a teenager and then a real-life adult,
从十几岁再到成年，

57
00:02:35.452 --> 00:02:37.310
will call me for the rest of our lives,
在剩下的岁月中 都会以某种称呼来叫我，

58
00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:40.071
was both extremely scary and exciting.
这让我既恐惧又兴奋。

59
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:44.538
And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called "mama"
我花了9个月的时间去纠结， 被叫做妈妈

60
00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:46.563
or something like it didn't feel like me at all.
或者其它的称呼，一点都不像我。

61
00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:49.601
And no matter how many times or versions of "mom" I tried,
无论我试过多少次， 或者多少个“妈妈”的版本，

62
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.005
it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable.
总感觉是被逼的，而且极度不舒服。

63
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:56.437
I knew being called "mom" or "mommy" would be easier to digest for most people.
我知道被叫做“妈妈”或“妈咪” 对大部分人而言更容易理解。

64
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.802
The idea of having two moms is not super novel,
有两个妈妈并不十分新奇，

65
00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.337
especially where we live.
尤其在我生活的地方。

66
00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:03.159
So I tried other words.
于是我试了试其它的词。

67
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.087
And when I played around with "daddy," it felt better.

68
00:03:06.388 --> 00:03:08.086
Better, but not perfect.
好一点，但也不完美。

69
00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:11.278
It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked
就感觉有一双鞋你很喜欢，

70
00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:13.103
but you needed to wear and break in.
但是要弄破了才能穿进去一样。

71
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.834
And I knew the idea of being a female-born person being called "daddy"
我知道一个出生时是女性的人 被叫做“爹地”

72
00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:20.184
was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments.
是一条更难走的路， 会遇到许多不舒服的时刻。

73
00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.398
But, before I knew it, the time had come

74
00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:25.366
and Elliot came screaming into the world, like most babies do,

75
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.992
and my new identity as a parent began.

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:31.159
I decided on becoming a daddy, and our new family faced the world.

77
00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.461
Now one of the most common things that happens when people meet us
最常发生的一件事， 就是当人们遇到我们

78
00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:36.794
is for people to "mom" me.
他们会认为我是“妈妈”。

79
00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:40.111
And when I get "momed", there are several ways the interaction can go,

80
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:43.588
and I've drawn this map to help illustrate my options.

81
00:03:43.572 --> 00:03:45.183
(Laughter)
（笑声）

82
00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:48.103
So, option one is to ignore the assumption
方案一就是无视这种假设，

83
00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.067
and allow folks to continue to refer to me as "mom,"
让他们继续认为我是“妈妈”，

84
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:53.044
which is not awkward for the other party,
对他们而言没有问题，

85
00:03:52.828 --> 00:03:55.435
but is typically really awkward for us.
但对我们而言就很尴尬。

86
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.721
And it usually causes me to restrict my interaction with those people.
而且这经常会让我 拒绝跟这些人交流。

87
00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:00.500
Option one.
方案一。

88
00:04:00.524 --> 00:04:03.794
Option two is to stop and correct them

and say something like,

当我这么说之后， 接下来会有一到两种情况。

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.635

because they feel bad or awkward or guilty or weird.
因为他们觉得不好、 尴尬、内疚或者奇怪。

96
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.405
But more often, what happens is folks get really confused

97
00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:28.928
and look up with an intense look and say something like,

98
00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:30.930
"Does this mean you want to transition?

Well, option one is oftentimes the easier route.

Option two is always the more authentic one.

106

even in the best case.
即便在最好的情况下。

107
00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:50.043
And I'll say that over time, my ability to navigate this complicated map

108
00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:51.726
has gotten easier.
会越来越强。

109
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:53.394

Now, I won't stand here and pretend

111
00:04:55.397 --> 00:04:57.786
like I've mastered this, it's pretty far from it.

112
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.727
And there are days when I still allow option one to take place
有时候我还是会选择方案一，

113
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:03.124
because option two is just too hard or too risky.

There's no way to be sure of anyone's reaction,

can be met with serious threats to me

So I weigh the costs against the risks

But despite this risk,

I need to model agency, authenticity and vulnerability,

129
00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:53.202

When we got our first sonogram,

给我们打印了一张照片 就让我们离开了。

141
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.881
We shared the photo with our families like everyone does
像其他人一样， 我们把照片发给家里人看了，

142
00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:27.008
and soon after, my mom showed up at our house with a bag filled --
很快，我妈妈拎着个大袋子 就到了我家，

143
00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:28.094
I'm not exaggerating,
一点也不夸张，

144
00:06:28.358 --> 00:06:33.534
it was like this high and it was filled, overflowing with pink clothes and toys.
那个袋子有这么高， 装满了粉色的衣服和玩具。

145
00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:38.138
Now I was a little annoyed to be confronted with a lot of pink things,
看着那一大堆粉色的东西， 我其实有点不爽，

146
00:06:37.932 --> 00:06:39.517
and having studied gender
研究了那么久性别

147
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.128
and spent countless hours teaching about it in workshops and classrooms,
花了无数时间 在工作室和教室教课，

148
00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:46.520
I thought I was pretty well versed on the social construction of gender
我以为自己已经精通 社会的性别架构

149
00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:49.040
and how sexism is a devaluing of the feminine

150
00:06:49.064 --> 00:06:52.075
and how it manifests both explicitly and implicitly.
以及它如何表现得即明显又隐蔽。

151
00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:57.124
But this situation, this aversion to a bag full of pink stuff,
但这种情况，这种 对一大袋子粉色东西的厌恶之情

152
00:06:57.148 --> 00:07:00.441
forced me to explore my rejection of highly feminized things
让我对在孩子的世界里 出现极度女性化的东西

153
00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:01.799
in my child's world.
感到非常抗拒。

154
00:07:03.286 --> 00:07:05.484
I realized that I was reinforcing sexism
我意识到我恰恰在证实性别歧视

155
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.079
and the cultural norms I teach as problematic.
这种原本我在教学中 视作问题的文化规范。

156
00:07:08.477 --> 00:07:11.695
No matter how much I believed in gender neutrality in theory,
无论在理论上我多么相信中性，

157
00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:17.127
in practice, the absence of femininity is not neutrality, it's masculinity.
然而在实践中，女性气质的缺位 就不是中立，是男子主义。

158
00:07:18.116 --> 00:07:20.937
If I only dress my baby in greens and blues and grays,
如果我只给自己的宝宝 穿绿色、蓝色和灰色，

159
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:24.699
the outside world doesn't think, "Oh, that's a cute gender-neutral baby."
其他人并不会认为， “哦，那是个可爱的性别中立的宝宝。”

160
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.466
They think, "Oh, what a cute boy."
他们会想， “哦，多可爱的一个男孩儿。”

161
00:07:28.357 --> 00:07:32.072
So my theoretical understanding of gender and my parenting world collided hard.
因此，我对于性别的理论理解 和我作为家长的世界很难相融。

162
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.135
Yes, I want a diversity of colors and toys for my child to experience.
我想让我的孩子体会 各种颜色和玩具。

163
00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.398
I want a balanced environment for her to explore

164
00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:40.000
and make sense of in her own way.

165
00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:43.094
We even picked a gender-neutral name for our female-born child.
我们甚至给我们的女宝宝 选了个中性的名字。

166
00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:46.508
But gender neutrality is much easier as a theoretical endeavor
但是性别中立 作为一种理论尝试还可以，

167
00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.030
than it is as a practice.
实践起来要难得多。

168
00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:51.163
And in my attempts to create gender neutrality,
我在尝试做到性别中立的时候，

169
00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:54.683
I was inadvertently privileging masculinity over femininity.
会在不经意间突出男子气概， 压制女性气质。

170
00:07:55.218 --> 00:07:58.647
So, rather than toning down or eliminating femininity in our lives,
因此我们并没有减少或者消除 生活中的女性气质，

171
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:00.876
we make a concerted effort to celebrate it.
而是通过多种努力来拥抱它。

172
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.575
We have pinks among the variety of colors,
在众多颜色中我们也保留粉色，

173
00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.457
we balance out the cutes with handsomes

174
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:07.357
and the prettys with strongs and smarts

175
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:10.403
and work really hard not to associate any words with gender.

176
00:08:10.397 --> 00:08:12.937
We value femininity and masculinity

177
00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:14.944
while also being highly critical of it.
同时也会非常慎重地审视它们。

178
00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:18.306
And do our best to not make her feel limited by gender roles.

179
00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.124
And we do all this in hopes

180
00:08:19.718 --> 00:08:24.062
that we model a healthy and empowered relationship with gender for our kid.

181
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.667
Now this work to develop a healthy relationship with gender for Elliot
帮助埃利奥特 发展健康的性别观的这一过程，

182
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:31.556
made me rethink and evaluate how I allowed sexism to manifest

183
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.083
in my own gender identity.

in order to live up to a masculinity that was not healthy

186

187
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.611
Doing this self-work meant I had to reject option one.

188
00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:46.445
I couldn't ignore and move on.

189
00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:48.175

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.381
I had to engage with some of my most uncomfortable parts

to move towards my most authentic self.

192
00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:57.102

也就是说我要正视身体上的不适。

193
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.907
It's pretty common for trans people to feel uncomfortable in their body,

I realized that by not engaging with that discomfort

and coming to a positive and affirming place with my body,

to ignore my kid when she asks me about my body or to hide it from her.

until we walked away.
