you have an empty piece of land.

it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

52
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.396
and play in that.

53
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.836
But what Silvarret has done here

even though it looks real.

59
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.476
So he kind of investigated

It looks just like the Netherlands.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.756
So the places are really densely populated.
这些地方住满了人。

68
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.756
So what you need is highways, trains,
那么你就需要高速公路，铁路，

69
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.036
anything connecting these small town centers together.

Lots of people, lots of moving,

71
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.420
so transportation is the key here.

72
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.036
But then let's go even more on the fantasy side.

This is one of my personal favorites.

These city designs are what I love the most.
这些城市设计是我最喜欢的。

76
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.116
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,
这是一名叫Conflictnerd的玩家 做出的一个层叠式城市，

77
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.300
and the basic idea is that you have concentric circle routes.
其核心想法是把道路做成同心环，

78
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.356
So the city is a big circle
整个城市是一个大环形，

79
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.220
with tinier circles inside.
在这个里面有更小的环形。

80
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.476
And the thing is that you put all of the services in the center,

81
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.916
and then people actually live on the outer ring,

82
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.716
because there is less traffic, less noise, less pollution,

83
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.676
so that is where you want to live.
这才是你想要住的地方。

84
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.636
But the services are still really close by.
但是城市的服务网络依然近在咫尺，

85
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.315
They are in the center.
它们都在城市中心。

86
00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:32.500
And this is the soul of the game.
这才是这个游戏的灵魂。

87
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.196
The player has to understand
玩家们需要认识到，

88
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.796
what are the wishes, what are the needs
什么是住在城市里的小人物们想要的，

89
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.820
of the tiny people living in the cities.
而什么又是它们真正需要的。

90
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.316
So you need to know where you should put the things.
所以你需要知道怎么去 安排各种机构的位置。

91
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.876
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.
比如只有一个医院是不够的。

92
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.636
It needs to be accessible.
医院要尽量触手可及。

93
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.540
Citizens need to reach the hospital.
居民们需要就近就医。

94
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.996
And this is one way to do it.
这种城市布局是 实现这个目标的一种方法。

95
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.860
So maybe this is something that we might be seeing someday.
也可能是我们未来某天能看到的东西。

96
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.900
And then even more into the future.

97
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.060
Astergea by Yuttho.
这是Yuttho所创造的城市Astergea。

98
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.436
So Yuttho does YouTube videos and plays the game.
Yuttho会制作YouTube视频 同时也是这个游戏的玩家。

99
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.116
What he did here was actually a 12-point series
他做的其实是关于如何创造这座城市的

100
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.300
of creating this city.
一个12点系列。

101
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.356
So what he does is he plays the game,
他一边玩游戏，

102
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.636
he records it
一边做记录，

103
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.300
and he explains as he's going what he's doing and why.
同时会解释他在做什么， 以及为什么要这么做。

104
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.116
And as a part of this series,
作为这个系列的一部分，

105
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.396
he actually did an interview with an actual urban planner
他甚至去采访了一个 真正的城市规划师，

106
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.220
called Jeff Speck.
Jeff Speck。

107
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.076
And Speck is an expert on the concept of walkability.
Speck是“可步行”这一概念的专家，

108
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.476
The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk,
其核心理念是如果你想让居民们

109
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.436
which is kind of beneficial,
多从事步行这一有益的活动，

110
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.196
you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.
你就需要让步行成为一个 真正意义上的交通方式。

111
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.020
It should be a good way to reach places.

112
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.196
So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept,
Yuttho解释了这一概念，

113
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.236
he had Speck explain it, too,
他也让Speck解释了一遍，

114
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.220
and then he applied it to the city that he was building.
然后他将这一概念应用到了 他所建造的城市中。

115
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.916
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future:
我们看到的是Yuttho对于未来的远见：

116
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.196
lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas,
多种多样的公共交通，步行街，广场，

117
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.820
connecting high-rise buildings.
连接着高层建筑。

118
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.196
Maybe this is what the future might look like.
这可能就是未来的样子。

119
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.676
And the game system works really well for this.
并且这个游戏系统可以 很好的展现这样的理念。

120
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.516
We are seeing some real-world uses to this game.
我们看到这个游戏正在 真实世界发挥一些作用。

121
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.236
So we know that some urban planners are using it as a sketching tool,
一些城市规划人员正在把它 当做一个草图工具在使用，

122
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.556
so while the simulation is not completely realistic,
即使这些模拟并不是完全真实的，

123
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.516
it is realistic enough that if something works in the game,
它们也足够逼真了，如果 一些东西在游戏中起到了作用，

124
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.436
it is highly likely that it will also work in the real world,
它们也很有可能 同样在真实世界起作用，

125
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.556
so that you can actually try out things,
所以你可以利用游戏场景进行测试，

126
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.556
see if this intersection might fit this kind of a situation.
看看这个十字路口是否适合这种情况。

127
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.116
If we build a new road, would it help?
如果我们修建一条新路，会有帮助吗？

128
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.100
And this is what you can do with this game.
这就是你能用这个游戏做的一些事情。

129
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.996
There was one really interesting contest held
芬兰城市海门林纳

130
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.700
by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.
举办了一个很有趣的比赛。

131
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.476
So what they did was that they had a new area

132
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.900
that they wanted to develop in the city.

133
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.316
They made a map with the existing city,
他们根据现实的城市做了一个地图，

134
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.516
they left empty the area that they would want to develop
把想开发的区域留出一片空白

135
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.876
and shared this map.
并且分享这个地图。

136
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.916
So anyone could download the map,
任何人都能下载这个地图，

137
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.556
play the game, build the area
玩这个游戏，建造这片区域，

138
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.300
and submit their creations to the city council.
并且将他们的创意提交给城市议会。

139
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.716
So they have not yet built anything,
虽然他们现在还没有修建任何东西，

140
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.516
but it might just be that they use one of these plans
但是有可能他们会采用

141
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.876
made with the game

144
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.220
these are the people who are coming up with new kinds of solutions.
都是一些正在筹划解决方法的人。

145
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.676
We know that cities are growing.

They're getting bigger as we go,
正随着人口的增长变得越来越庞大，
