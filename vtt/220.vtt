00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:15.735
So, a few years ago I heard an interesting rumor.
几年前，我听到一个有趣的传言。

2
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.597
Apparently, the head of a large pet food company
据说，一家大型宠物食品企业的负责人

3
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.876
would go into the annual shareholder's meeting
会参加年度的股东大会，

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.361
with can of dog food.
并带着一罐狗粮。

5
00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.486
And he would eat the can of dog food.
他会吃这罐狗粮。

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.063
And this was his way of convincing them that if it was good enough for him,
这证明那些食品对他而言足够好，

7
00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:29.098
it was good enough for their pets.
自然也对宠物足够好。

8
00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:32.224
This strategy is now known as "dogfooding,"
这个策略现在被称作“吃狗粮”，

9
00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:34.567
and it's a common strategy in the business world.
这是商业中常见的策略。

10
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.075
It doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food,
这个策略并不是指每个人都去吃狗的食物，

11
00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.320
but businesspeople will use their own products
而是商人会用他们自己的产品

12
00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:40.881
to demonstrate that they feel --
来证实他们的感觉——

13
00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:42.610
that they're confident in them.
他们对自己的产品很自信。

14
00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:44.559
Now, this is a widespread practice,
现在这已是一个普通的做法，

15
00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:47.678
but I think what's really interesting is when you find exceptions

16
00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:47.727
to this rule,

when you find cases of businesses or people in businesses
当你发现在许多商业案例中，

18
00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:52.082
who don't use their own products.

19
00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:55.913
Turns out there's one industry where this happens in a common way,

20
00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:56.925
in a pretty regular way,

and that is the screen-based tech industry.
这个行业就是基于屏幕的技术行业。

22
00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:04.407
So, in 2010, Steve Jobs, when he was releasing the iPad,
在2010年，当史蒂夫·乔布斯发布 iPad 时，

23
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.173

25
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.494
way better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone.

26
00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:15.045
It's an incredible experience."

27
00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:17.814
A couple of months later, he was approached by a journalist

and they had a long phone call.
他们通了一次很长的电话。

30
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.751
At the end of the call,

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.659
the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball.
记者提出了一个看似无关紧要的问题。

32
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.764
He said to him, "Your kids must love the iPad."
他对乔布斯说：“你的孩子一定很喜欢 iPad。”

33
00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.252
There's an obvious answer to this,
这个问题有一个显然的答案，

34
00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.895
but what Jobs said really staggered the journalist.

35
00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.110
He was very surprised,

We limit how much technology our kids use at home."

This is a very common thing in the tech world.

about what we should do at home in our own lives,

The problem is, 5 and 6pm looks different on different days.
但问题在于，5 点到 6 点的安排在每天是不同的。

181
00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.354
I think a far better strategy is to say,

182
00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.847
I do certain things every day,

It's far away,

00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:42.862
as far away as possible.

Because we're really bad at resisting temptation.

193

But when you have a stopping cue that, every time dinner begins,

I think it's a fantastic strategy,

207
00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:15.132
and we know it works, because when people do this --
而且我们知道它有效，因为当人们这样做的时候——

208
00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:17.746
and I've tracked a lot of people who have tried this --

it expands.

It's a really powerful idea,

and we know people feel much better about their lives when they do this.

216
00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:37.382
So what's the take home here?
所以重点是什么？

217
00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:39.645
Screens are miraculous; I've already said that,

218
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.021
and I feel that it's true.

and take snaps out the window -- that's the easy thing to do --
对窗外拍几张照片——这很容易做到——

226
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.673
