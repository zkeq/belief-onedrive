Why do we need rules on competition at all?

competition can be inconvenient,
竞争会是个阻碍

48
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.620
because competition means that the race is never over,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.100
the game is never won.
没有结束的一天

is powerful.
十分强大

55
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.380
It's rooted in motives as old as Adam and Eve:

you have a dangerous mix.

We see that in political life.
这在政治中很常见

63
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.036

在世上某处

64

become reluctant to give it back.

And competition rules can do a similar thing in the market,

making sure that greed and fear doesn't overcome fairness.

to the electrical wiring to the light bulbs.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.796
And for many of those parts,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.396
the world's carmakers,

82
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.460
they are dependent on only a few suppliers.
只依赖少数供应商

83
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.476
So it's hardly surprising
所以，那些供应商会被诱惑到

84
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.556
that it is kind of tempting for those suppliers
聚在一起定价格

85
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.020
to come together and fix prices.
这一点也不奇怪

86
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.636
But just imagine what that could do

to the final price of your new car in the market.

are also looking into the market for car parts,

it has ever pursued.

there would be no investigation,

and there would be nothing to stop this collusion from happening

and the prices of your car to go up.

100
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.756
Yet it's not only companies

101
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.580
who can undermine fair competition.
除了公司企业

102
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.300
Governments can do it, too.
还有政府机构

103
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.716
And governments do that when they hand out subsidies
政府发补贴给受青睐的少数时

104
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.300
to just the favorite few, the selected.
就已经在破坏公平竞争了

105
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.116
They may do that when they hand out subsidies --
政府发补贴给企业的时候

106
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.380
and, of course, all financed by taxpayers --
也可能破坏公平竞争

107
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.700
to companies.
当然，所有费用由纳税人买单

108
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.516
That may be in the form of special tax treatments,
这种破坏可能以特别税收待遇的形式出现

109
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.956
like the tax benefits

110
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.876
that firms like Fiat, Starbucks and Apple got

from some governments in Europe.

112
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.500
Those subsidies stop companies from competing on equal terms.

113
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.636
They can mean that the companies that succeed,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.260
well, they are the companies that got the most subsidy,
是那些得到最多补贴的公司

115
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.516
the ones that are the best-connected,
也是最会搞关系的公司

116
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.676
and not, as it should be,
然而成功的公司应该是

117

the companies that serve consumers the best.
给消费者最好的服务的

118
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.580
So there are times when we need to step in

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.740
to make sure that competition works the way it should.
确保竞争依其原本的方式进行

120
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.180
By doing that, we help the market to work fairly,

121
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.220
because competition gives consumers the power to demand a fair deal.
因为竞争使消费者有权做公平的交易

122
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.156
It means that companies know that if they cannot offer good prices
这表示，如果公司企业 知道自己不能提供更好的价格

123
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.756
or the service that's expected,

124
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.180
well, the customers will go somewhere else.
那么消费者就会另寻他处

125
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.156
And that sort of fairness is more important

126
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.340

Very few people think about politics all the time.

128
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.580
Some even skip it at election time.
有些人甚至忽略选举活动

129
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.196
But we are all in the market.

130
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.700
Every day, we are in the market.

131
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.340
And we don't want businesses to agree on prices in the back office.

132
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.060
We don't want them to divide the market between them.

133
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.356

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.036
just to shut out competitors

from ever showing us what they can do.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.620
If that happens,
如果这种事发生了

137
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.956
well, obviously, we feel that someone has cheated us,
显然我们会感到被欺骗

138
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.100
that we are being ignored or taken for granted by the market.
被忽略或不被市场重视

139
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.076
And that may undermine not only our trust in the market
这不只危害我们对市场的信任

140
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.780
but also our trust in the society.
也危害我们对社会的信任

141
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.436
In a recent survey,

more than two-thirds of Europeans

said that they had felt the effects of lack of competition:

146
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.876

if they wanted to travel by bus or by plane,

And that might seem like very small things,

151
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.380

that the world isn't really fair.

become more like the private property of a few powerful companies.

The market is not the society.

MV: Well, first of all, I take it very seriously,
韦斯塔格尔：首先，我很严肃看待这事

308
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.980
because bias has no room in law enforcement.
因为执法是容不下偏见的

309
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.156
We have to prove our cases with the evidence and the facts

310
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.196
and the jurisprudence

311
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.260
in order also to present it to the courts.
以便陈给法庭

312
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.516
The second thing is that Europe is open for business,

313
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.276
but not for tax evasion.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.980
(Applause)

315
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.356
The thing is that we are changing,
重点是，我们不断在改变

316
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.596
and for instance, when I ask my daughters --
举个例子，我问我女儿 -

317
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.156
they use Google as well --

318
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.676
"Why do you do that?"
“你们为什么用它？”

319
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.676
They say, "Well, because it works. It's a very good product."
她们说，“因为它好用啊，是很好的产品”

320
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.156
They would never, ever, come up with the answer,

321
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.900
"It's because it's a US product."

322
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.636
It's just because it works.

323
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.716
And that is of course how it should be.
当然，原本就该是这样的

324
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.156
But just the same, it is important that someone is looking after to say,
同样的，关注你的人说以下的话也很重要

325
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.516
"Well, we congratulate you
“当你不断成长时“

326
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.076
while you grow and grow and grow,
”我们恭喜你“

327
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.836
but congratulation stops
”但若我们发现你利用职权“

328
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.140
if we find that you're misusing your position

329
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.036
to harm competitors so that they cannot serve consumers."

330
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.156
BG: It will be a fascinating case to follow.
