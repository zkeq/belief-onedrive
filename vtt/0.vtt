00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.129
Ever since I was a young girl, I was always fascinated --
我从小就非常好奇——

2
00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:17.310
(Laughter)
（笑声）

3
00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:18.485
Oh!
哦！

4
00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.609
(Laughter)
（笑声）

5
00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.303
OK, I meant younger and more short.
好吧，我是说更年轻，更矮的时候。

6
00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:24.500
(Laughter)
（笑声）

7
00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.524
If that's possible to imagine.
如果你可以想象到的话。

8
00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.992
But ever since I was a young girl,
从我还是个小姑娘的时候开始，

9
00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:33.556
I was always fascinated with how the world worked exactly how it did.
我就对这个世界 是如何运转感到非常好奇。

10
00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.691
So this, very early on,
这一点让我从很早开始，

11
00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:40.115
led me to the fields of mathematics and chemistry.
就对数学和化学很感兴趣。

12
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:45.048
I would keep going further and further, and as I kept going,
我努力学习，而随着学习的深入，

13
00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:48.447
I realized that all the fields of science are interconnected.
我意识到所有科学领域 都是互相关联的。

14
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.762
And without one, the others have little or no value.
如果离开某一学科，其他的学科的价值 就会大大下降，甚至毫无价值。

15
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.150
So, inspired by Marie Curie and my local science museum,
于是，受居里夫人 和我老家的科学博物馆的启发，

16
00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:01.469
I decided to start asking these questions myself
我决定开始在我家的车库里， 或者我的卧室中

17
00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:04.318
and engage in my own independent research,
思考这些问题，

18
00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:07.045
whether it be out of my garage or my bedroom.
并进行独立研究。

19
00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:10.227
I started reading journal papers,
我开始阅读期刊论文，

20
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.528
started doing science competitions,
参加科学竞赛，

21
00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:15.409
started participating in science fairs,
参加科学展会，

22
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.309
doing anything I could
用尽一切办法

23
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.222
to get the knowledge that I so desperately wanted.
获取我渴望的知识。

24
00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:25.691
So while I was studying anatomy for a competition,
有一次为了参加竞赛， 我开始研究解剖学，

25
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:29.715
I came across the topic of something called chronic wounds.
我遇到了一个名词， 叫长期性伤口。

26
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:34.489
And one thing that stood out to me was a statistic
引起我注意的是一项数据统计，

27
00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:39.603
that said that the number of people in the United States with chronic wounds
在美国有长期性伤口的人数

28
00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:43.207
exceeds the number of people with breast cancer,
比患乳腺癌，

29
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:48.541
colon cancer, lung cancer and leukemia, combined.
结肠癌、肺癌和白血病的人 加起来还多。

30
00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:50.937
Hold up.
先等一下。

31
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:52.492
So what is a chronic wound?
什么是长期性伤口呢？

32
00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:53.667
(Laughter)
（笑声）

33
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:57.096
And why haven't I heard about a 5K walk for chronic wounds,
我怎么从没听过为支持 长期性伤口患者进行的5公里步行活动，

34
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.071
why haven't I even heard about a chronic wound in general?
甚至从没听过长期性伤口这回事？

35
00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:02.143
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.175
So after I got past those preliminary questions,
在我搞清楚这些初级问题之后，

37
00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:09.492
and one that I will clarify for you,
我要说清楚一点，

38
00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:13.326
a chronic wound is essentially when someone gets a normal wound,
长期性伤口本质上就是普通的伤口，

39
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.008
except it fails to heal normally
只是它无法正常愈合，

40
00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:19.770
because the patient has some kind of preexisting condition,
因为病人在受伤之前 就已经有其他病症会影响愈合，

41
00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:21.927
which in most cases is diabetes.
大部分情况是糖尿病。

42
00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.457
So more staggering statistics were to be found
随着研究的不断深入，

43
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.905
as I kept going on in this research.
我找到了更多令人震惊的数据。

44
00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.733
In the year 2010 alone,
仅在2010年，

45
00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:39.196
50 billion dollars were spent worldwide to treat chronic wounds.
全球范围内用于治疗长期性伤口的 费用就高达500亿美元。

46
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.238
In addition, it's estimated that about two percent of the population
除此之外，据估计，有2%的人口

47
00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:46.214
will get a chronic wound at some point in their lifetime.
会在一生中的某个时刻 遭遇长期性伤口。

48
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.952
This was absurd.
这真的有点难以置信。

49
00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:50.811
So as I started doing more research,
于是我开始更深入的研究，

50
00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:52.556
I found that there was a correlation
我发现长期性伤口的出现与否

51
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.199
between the moisture level inside a wound dressing
与伤口包扎物的潮湿程度

52
00:02:55.223 --> 00:02:59.103
and the stage of healing that the chronic wound would be at.
和伤口治疗所处的 阶段之间存在关联。

53
00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.477
So I decided, why don't I design something
于是我就想， 为什么不设计一件产品，

54
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.730
to measure the moisture level within the wound
可以测量伤口的湿度，

55
00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:09.062
so this can help doctors and patients treat their wounds better.
就能让医生和病人 更好地对伤口进行治疗。

56
00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:12.881
And essentially, expedite the healing process.
这样一来就能加快治疗进程。

57
00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.505
So that's exactly what I set out to do.
这就是我决定要做的事情。

58
00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:20.151
Being a 14-year-old working out of her garage-turned-lab,
一个14岁女孩， 在自己家的车库实验室工作，

59
00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:22.215
I had a lot of constraints.
面临着许多限制。

60
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.024
Most being that I wasn't given a grant, I wasn't given a lot of money,
最主要的是我没有经费，没什么钱，

61
00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:28.586
and I wasn't given a lot of resources.
也没有什么资源。

62
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.125
In addition, I had a lot of criteria, as well.
除此之外，我的设计 还需要符合许多标准。

63
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.840
Since this product would be readily interacting with the body,
因为这个产品需要跟人体发生作用，

64
00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:38.040
it had to be biocompatible,
因此它必须具备生物兼容性，

65
00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:40.001
it also had to be low-cost,
而且成本要低，

66
00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:42.936
as I was designing it and paying for it myself.
因为我是自己设计并自费生产。

67
00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:46.199
It also had to be mass-manufacturable,
而且它还需要能够量产，

68
00:03:46.223 --> 00:03:49.258
because I wanted it to be made anywhere, for anyone.
因为我想让它能 在任何地方生产，人人都能使用。

69
00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:53.278
Thus, I drafted up a schematic.
因此，我画了个示意图。

70
00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:57.794
What you see on the left hand-side is the early schematics in my design,
左手边的图是我早期的设计，

71
00:03:57.818 --> 00:04:03.162
showing both a bird's-eye view and also one stacking variant.
同时显示了鸟瞰图和堆叠变体。

72
00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:04.361
A stacking variant means
堆叠变体的意思是，

73
00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:09.575
that the entire product is consisted of different individual parts
整个产品由不同的独立部分组成

74
00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.389
that have to work in unison.
需要协同发挥作用。

75
00:04:11.413 --> 00:04:15.395
And what's shown there is one possible arrangement.
图上显示的是某种可行的方案。

76
00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.867
So what exactly is this?
那这些到底是什么呢？

77
00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:22.484
So I had gone on to testing my sensors
我对我的传感器进行了实验，

78
00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:26.024
and as all scientists have stumbles along their work,
但凡科学家，总会遇到挫折，

79
00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:29.596
I also had a couple of problems in my first generation of sensors.
我也不例外，第一代 传感器出现了不少问题。

80
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.325
First of all, I couldn't figure out
首先，我想不出好办法

81
00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.318
how to get a nanoparticle ink into a printcheck cartridge
把纳米墨水精确地 注入打印墨盒里面，

82
00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:36.270
without spilling it all over my carpet.
而不会撒得地毯上到处都是。

83
00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:38.071
That was problem number one.
这是第一个问题。

84
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.874
Problem number two was,
第二个问题，

85
00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:43.342
I couldn't exactly control the sensitivity of my sensors.
我没法控制传感器的灵敏度。

86
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.873
I couldn't scale them up or down,
无法将它调高或者调低，

87
00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:47.977
I couldn't really do anything of that sort.
一点办法都没有。

88
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:48.883
So I wanted something to solve it.
我要想办法解决问题。

89
00:04:48.883 --> 00:04:52.308
Problem one was easily solved by some scouting on eBay and Amazon
第一个问题很容易， 我搜了一下易趣网和亚马逊，

90
00:04:52.778 --> 00:04:54.523
for syringes that I could use.
找到了我可以用的注射器。

91
00:04:54.547 --> 00:04:57.659
Problem two, however, required a lot more thought.
第二个问题就需要 更多的思考来解决了。

92
00:04:57.683 --> 00:04:59.873
So this is where this factors in.
下面就是我要谈的。

93
00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:01.537
So what a space-filling curve does
所谓的空间填充曲线，

94
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.976
is it aims to take up all the area it can within one unit square.
其目标是占据一个 平方单位内所有的空间。

95
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.734
And by writing a computer program, you can have different iterations
通过编写计算机程序， 你可以得到以不同方式重复的

96
00:05:10.758 --> 00:05:12.278
of the different curve,
不同曲线，

97
00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:14.564
which increasingly get close to one unit square,
它们会越来越接近 填满一个平方单位，

98
00:05:14.588 --> 00:05:16.588
but never quite reaches there.
但永远也无法完全填满。

99
00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:20.473
So now I could control the thickness, the size,
于是我就可以控制它的厚度、尺寸，

100
00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:23.858
I could do whatever I want with it, and I could predict my results.
做我想做的一切， 也可以对结果进行预测。

101
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.763
So I started constructing my sensors
于是我开始制造我的传感器

102
00:05:27.787 --> 00:05:29.914
and testing them more rigorously,
并且更严格地测试，

103
00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:33.501
using money that I had gotten from previous science fair awards.
实验花费来自我以前 参加科学展会的奖金。

104
00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:37.885
Lastly, I had to connect this data in order to be read.
最后，我需要建立输出，让数据可读。

105
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.378
So I interfaced it with a Bluetooth chip,
于是我用蓝牙芯片做了个交互界面，

106
00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.655
which you can see here by the app screenshots on the right.
就是右边的应用截屏的样子。

107
00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:47.961
And what this does is that anyone can monitor the progress of their wound,
它可以让我们 监控自己伤口愈合的过程，

108
00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:52.399
and it can be transmitted over a wireless connection
也可以通过无线连接的方式

109
00:05:52.423 --> 00:05:55.623
to the doctor, the patient or whoever needs it.
传给医生、病人或者任何需要的人。

110
00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.901
[Continued Testing and Refinement]
【持续测试和改进中】

111
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.679
So in conclusion, my design was successful --
总结来说，我的设计是成功的，

112
00:06:02.703 --> 00:06:05.472
however, science never ends.
当然，科学永无止尽。

113
00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:08.976
There's always something to be done, something to be refined.
总有事情可以做，总有地方可以改进。

114
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.833
So that's what I'm currently in the process of doing.
这就是我现在正在做的。

115
00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:14.649
However, what I learned was
然而，我真正学到的是

116
00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:17.969
what's more important than the actual thing I designed
比起我设计出来的东西，更重要的

117
00:06:17.993 --> 00:06:21.526
is an attitude that I had taken on while doing this.
是我在这过程中所持的态度。

118
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.135
And that attitude was,
这个态度就是，

119
00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.493
even though I'm a 14-year-old working in her garage
尽管我是一个14岁的孩子， 在自己家的车库中工作，

120
00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:31.214
on something that she doesn't completely understand,
做的也是自己不完全懂的事情，

121
00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:34.727
I could still make a difference and contribute to the field.
但我还是能做出点成绩， 对这个领域有所贡献。

122
00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:38.032
And that's what inspired me to keep going,
这一点鼓励我继续前进，

123
00:06:38.056 --> 00:06:41.913
and I hope it inspires many others to also do work like this
我也希望能鼓励更多的人 来做同样的事情，

124
00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:44.540
even though they're not very sure about it.
尽管他们对此还不太确定。

125
00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:48.152
So I hope that's a message that you all take on today.
这就是我今天想 传递给大家的信息。

126
00:06:48.176 --> 00:06:49.359
Thank you.
谢谢大家。
