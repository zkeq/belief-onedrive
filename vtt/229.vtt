00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.320
When people find out I write about time management,
当人们发现我写 关于时间管理的文章时，

2
00:00:16.408 --> 00:00:18.083
they assume two things.
他们都会假设两件事：

3
00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:22.368
One is that I'm always on time,
第一，我永远都准时，

4
00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:24.804
and I'm not.
但我并不是。

5
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:26.690
I have four small children,
我有四个小孩，

6
00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.530
and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness,
我偶尔将迟到归咎于他们，

7
00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.662
but sometimes it's just not their fault.
不过有时候真的不是因为他们。

8
00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.932
I was once late to my own speech on time management.
我有一次在去我的一个关于 时间管理的演讲时迟到了。

9
00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:35.996
(Laughter)
（笑声）

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.593
We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony.
我们都需要一点时间去好好地 体味一下这有多么讽刺。

11
00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.011
The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks
第二，人们总是假设我有很多关于

12
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.898
for saving bits of time here and there.
如何节省时间的贴士和技巧。

13
00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:49.666
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines,
有时候我听说一些杂志 在写这方面的故事，

14
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.017
generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day.
通常都是关于教读者如何 在一天中获得额外一个小时。

15
00:00:52.977 --> 00:00:56.357
And the idea is that we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities,
基本思路就是从日常的 每个活动中挤出一点时间，

16
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.528
add it up,
加起来，

17
00:00:56.858 --> 00:00:59.206
and we'll have time for the good stuff.
然后我们就有时间去做 更有意思的事情了。

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.784
I question the entire premise of this piece, but I'm always interested
我对这个说法持保留意见， 不过我还是愿意听听

19
00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:06.491
in hearing what they've come up with before they call me.
他们在找我之前有什么想法。

20
00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:07.061
Some of my favorites:
我最喜欢的几个是：

21
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:10.597
doing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns --
只完成那些只需要右转的事；

22
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:11.649
(Laughter)
（笑声）

23
00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:13.819
Being extremely judicious in microwave usage:
在用微波炉时，要极度审慎：

24
00:01:13.843 --> 00:01:16.566
it says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package,
当食物包装上面写了3到3.5分钟时，

25
00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.429
we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that.
我们要挑时间最短的那个。

26
00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.660
And my personal favorite, which makes sense on some level,
我个人最喜欢的是， 录下你最喜欢看的电视剧，

27
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.419
is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials.
然后你就可以跳过广告了。 其实在某个程度上，还是挺有道理的。

28
00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:26.735
That way, you save eight minutes every half hour,
这样，你每半个小时就可以挤出八分钟。

29
00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:29.141
so in the course of two hours of watching TV,
那么你葱用来看电视的两个小时中，

30
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.072
you find 32 minutes to exercise.
可以挤出32分钟锻炼的时间。

31
00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:32.609
(Laughter)
（笑声）

32
00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:33.918
Which is true.
倒的确是这么回事儿。

33
00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:37.028
You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise?
你还知道其他可以找到 32分钟锻炼时间的方法吗？

34
00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:39.781
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?
不要每天都看两个小时 电视就行了，对吧？

35
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:40.821
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:44.319
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up,
总之，就是要在各处都省点时间，

37
00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.359
we will finally get to everything we want to do.
加起来就有时间 做我们想做的事了。

38
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.563
But after studying how successful people spend their time
但在我了解成功的人如何分配时间，

39
00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:52.224
and looking at their schedules hour by hour,
并看过了他们的时间表后，

40
00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:55.544
I think this idea has it completely backward.
我觉得这个想法是 完全本末倒置的。

41
00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.215
We don't build the lives we want by saving time.
我们不是通过节省时间来 打造我们想过的生活。

42
00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:01.946
We build the lives we want,
我们应该先建立我们想要的生活，

43
00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.423
and then time saves itself.
时间就会自然而然节省出来。

44
00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:07.784
Here's what I mean.
我来解释一下。

45
00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:09.525
I recently did a time diary project

46
00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:14.111
looking at 1,001 days in the lives of extremely busy women.

kids to care for, maybe parents to care for,

49
00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:20.292
community commitments --

00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:22.422
busy, busy people.
都是一些很忙的人。

51
00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.826
I had them keep track of their time for a week
我让她们记录了一星期的行程，

52
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.163
so I could add up how much they worked and slept,

53
00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.683
and I interviewed them about their strategies, for my book.

54
00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.746
One of the women whose time log I studied

55

goes out on a Wednesday night for something.

and there is now water all over her basement.

58
00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.059
If you've ever had anything like this happen to you,

59
00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:45.558
you know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess.
你会知道眼前的景象 多么令人崩溃和沮丧。

60
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.292
So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night,

61
00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:50.193
next day she's got plumbers coming in,

63

All this is being recorded on her time log.

66

That's like finding an extra hour in the day.
这就等于一周七天 每天都要挤出一个小时。

67
00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:07.448
But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week,
但是假如你在这一周 刚开始时就问她，

68
00:03:07.472 --> 00:03:10.690
"Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?"

“你能在这周抽出七个小时 指导七个有潜力的人吗？“

70
00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:18.233
I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said,

71
00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:23.193
which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?"

she found seven hours.

75
00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:35.026
And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic.

76
00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:37.457
We cannot make more time,
我们不能创造更多时间，

77
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.660
but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.
但是时间会自己调整去适应 我们选择去做的事情。

78
00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:44.753
And so the key to time management
所以时间管理的关键就是

79
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:47.596
is treating our priorities

To get at this,

I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed.

By busy, I mean she was running a small business

with 12 people on the payroll,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.453
she had six children in her spare time.

I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview

87
00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:07.425
on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.

88
00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.448
I remember it was a Thursday morning,
我记得那是一个星期四的早晨，

89
00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:10.888
and she was not available to speak with me.
她没时间和我说话。

90
00:04:10.888 --> 00:04:12.479
Of course, right?
当然了，她很忙。

91
00:04:12.683 --> 00:04:15.102
But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me
但是她没时间和我说话的原因是，

92
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.082
is that she was out for a hike,
她去远足了。

93
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.128
because it was a beautiful spring morning,
因为那是春季一个美丽的清晨，

94
00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:20.528
and she wanted to go for a hike.

95
00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.076
So of course this makes me even more intrigued,
这样的她让我变得更感兴趣了，

96
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.276
and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this.

97
00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:28.976
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,

98
00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:33.432
every minute I spend, is my choice."
我花的每分每秒，都是我的选择。”

99
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.801
And rather than say,
所以与其说，

100
00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.254
"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"
”我没有时间做这个，这个，或者那个。”

101
00:04:37.713 --> 00:04:42.827
she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority."
她会说：”我不做这些事情因为 这些不是我的首要任务。“

102
00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.897
"I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority."
“我没有时间”的意思通常是 ”那不是我的首要任务”。

103
00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:51.783
If you think about it, that's really more accurate language.
其实你想想， 那的确是更准确的说法。

104
00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:54.371
I could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds,
我可能会告诉你我没有 时间清理百叶窗，

105
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:55.564
but that's not true.
但那不是真的。

106
00:04:55.588 --> 00:04:58.028
If you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds,
假如你愿意付我10万美金 让我给百叶窗除尘，

107
00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:59.218
I would get to it pretty quickly.
我会马上就去做。

108
00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:00.692
(Laughter)
（笑声）

109
00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:02.351
Since that is not going to happen,
既然那不可能发生，

110
00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:04.521
I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time;
我可以说不是因为时间不够，

111
00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.399
it's that I don't want to do it.
而是我不想做。

112
00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:10.014
Using this language reminds us that time is a choice.
这么说提醒了我们， 时间是一种选择。

113
00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:10.904
And granted,
我会告诉你，

114
00:05:10.904 --> 00:05:14.151
there may be horrible consequences for making different choices,
当然，不同的选择有时候会

115
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.497
I will give you that.
带来可怕的后果。

116
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:17.143
But we are smart people,
但是我们都是聪明人，

117
00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.025
and certainly over the long run,
从长远来看，

118
00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:21.025
we have the power to fill our lives
我们有能力去选择一些值得做的事，

119
00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:23.749
with the things that deserve to be there.
来填补我们生命中的时间。

120
00:05:24.904 --> 00:05:26.054
So how do we do that?
那么我们应该怎么做呢？

121
00:05:26.947 --> 00:05:28.379
How do we treat our priorities
我们要如何像对待那个

122
00:05:28.403 --> 00:05:30.734
as the equivalent of that broken water heater?
坏了的热水器一样 对待我们的首要任务？

123
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:33.670
Well, first we need to figure out what they are.
首先，我们需要找出哪些事最重要。

124
00:05:33.694 --> 00:05:36.448
I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this.

125
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.688
The first, on the professional side:
第一个，从职业的角度来说：

126
00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:39.790
I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year
我相信许多人在年底的时候

127
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.385
are giving or getting annual performance reviews.
会发出或者收到年度绩效审查。

128
00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.882
You look back over your successes over the year,
你回头看看这一年的成功和

129
00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:47.271
your "opportunities for growth."

130
00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.517
And this serves its purpose,
这的确起到了它的作用，

131
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.007
but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward.
但是我发现往前看会更有效。

132
00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.589
So I want you to pretend it's the end of next year.
我想让你们把这当做下一年的年底。

133
00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:58.507
You're giving yourself a performance review,

134
00:05:58.531 --> 00:06:03.047
and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.

135
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:09.641
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?
是哪三到五件事使 这一年变得如此出众？

136
00:06:10.554 --> 00:06:14.354
So you can write next year's performance review now.
你现在就可以写明年的绩效审查。

137
00:06:14.378 --> 00:06:16.625
And you can do this for your personal life, too.
你也可以在个人生活方面这么做。

138
00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:19.278
I'm sure many of you, like me, come December,
我相信你们许多人，包括我，在十二月，

139
00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:23.108
get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper,
都会收到这种夹着彩色纸的卡片。

140
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:28.141
on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.
上面写着“家庭假日信件”。

141
00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:29.803
(Laughter)
