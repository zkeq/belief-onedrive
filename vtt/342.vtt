1
00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:17.859
I'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories.
我创作有故事的照片是出于纯粹的热忱。

2
00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:23.065
Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment
摄影是对瞬间的记录，

3
00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.295
frozen within a fraction of time.
凝固了永恒的某一个瞬间。

4
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.157
Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece
随着时间流逝，每个瞬间或照片

5
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.694
of our memories as time passes.
都将我们的回忆化作实体。

6
00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.956
But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?
但是如果你可以在一张照片中, 捕捉不止一个瞬间呢？

7
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.353
What if a photograph could actually collapse time,
假如照片可以解构并重组时间，

8
00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.960
compressing the best moments of the day and the night
浓缩日夜中最佳的时刻，

9
00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:46.483
seamlessly into one single image?
并将其在一张图片上完美呈现呢？

10
00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:49.992
I've created a concept called "Day to Night"
我创造了“昼夜之间”这个概念，

11
00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.643
and I believe it's going to change
我深信它将改变

12
00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.104
the way you look at the world.
人们看待世界的方式。

13
00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:54.278
I know it has for me.
至少它已改变了我。

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.690
My process begins by photographing iconic locations,
我的创作始于对地标的记录，

15
00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:02.555
places that are part of what I call our collective memory.
我将这些地方看作大家“记忆中的共鸣”。

16
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.820
I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.
我大多取景于固定的至高点，而且从不移动。

17
00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:11.191
I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.
随着时间流动，我捕捉人类活动与光影变幻。

18
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:14.668
Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours
每个地点我都连续拍摄15至30小时，

19
00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:16.929
and shooting over 1,500 images,
单次素材超过1500张，

20
00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:20.033
I then choose the best moments of the day and night.
之后我挑选出最佳的瞬间，从白昼到黑夜。

21
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.830
Using time as a guide,
以时间为轴，

22
00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:27.147
I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph,
将这些美妙的瞬间融合到一张照片中，

23
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.819
visualizing our conscious journey with time.
将时间的流逝以具象的方式呈现。

24
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:33.220
I can take you to Paris
我可以带你们去巴黎，

25
00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:35.093
for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
在托内尔桥上看风景。

26
00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.276
And I can show you the early morning rowers
你们能看到清晨的桨手，

27
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.617
along the River Seine.
自塞纳河上掠过。

28
00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:42.216
And simultaneously,
与此同时，

29
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.474
I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
也能看到巴黎圣母院夜晚的灯光。

30
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.139
And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.
晨昏之间，还能感受巴黎的浪漫气氛。

31
00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:54.997
I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air,
我是一个常年悬空15米的街头摄影师，

32
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.351
and every single thing you see in this photograph
这张照片中的一切，

33
00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.236
actually happened on this day.
都是在当天真实发生的。

34
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.522
Day to Night is a global project,
“昼夜之间”是一个环球项目，

35
00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:06.839
and my work has always been about history.
而我的作品一直以历史为核心。

36
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:11.237
I'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice
我着迷于像威尼斯这样的地方，

37
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.789
and actually seeing it during a specific event.
也曾在特殊的日子造访过它。

38
00:02:13.813 --> 00:02:17.246
And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata,
我去看当地传统的划船比赛，

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.749
an event that's actually been taking place since 1498.

40
00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:25.368
The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.
船只和选手服饰的样子，与旧时一模一样。

41
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.143
And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is:
有一点很重要，我想特别强调一下：

42
00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:31.641
this is not a timelapse,
这并不是延时拍摄，

43
00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:35.529
this is me photographing throughout the day and the night.
而是我夜以继日的（连续）拍摄。

44
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.307
I am a relentless collector of magical moments.
对于捕捉那些惊艳的刹那，我从不倦怠。

45
00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:44.366
And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.
我唯恐错失任何精彩瞬间，这是我最大的动力。

46
00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:52.689
The entire concept came about in 1996.
整个“昼夜之间”的概念始于1996年。

47
00:02:52.713 --> 00:02:56.938
LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph
当时《LIFE》杂志委任我为巴兹·鲁曼导演的电影

48
00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:01.617
of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.
《罗密欧与朱丽叶》的全体演职人员拍摄一张全景照。

49
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.907
I got to the set and realized: it's a square.
我去了才发现，现场搭的景是方形的。

50
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:12.692
So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of 250 single images.
我能想到的拍摄全景图的唯一方法，就是拍摄250张照片，然后再进行拼贴。

51
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.769
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.
于是我让迪卡普里奥和丹尼斯相拥。

52
00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:19.583
And as I pan my camera to the right,
当我将镜头移至场景右侧时，

53
00:03:19.607 --> 00:03:22.205
I noticed there was a mirror on the wall
我发现墙上有面镜子，

54
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.644
and I saw they were actually reflecting in it.
而他们的身影恰好被反射在镜中。

55
00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:26.598
And for that one moment, that one image
为了那个瞬间，那幅画面，

56
00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:29.881
I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss for this one picture?"
我问他们 ，“为了这张照片，你们能亲吻对方吗？”

57
00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:32.696
And then I came back to my studio in New York,
之后我回到了纽约的工作室，

58
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.641
and I hand-glued these 250 images together
把250张照片一张张拼在一起，

59
00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:39.490
and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!
我后退一步，发出赞叹：“哇，这太酷了！

60
00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:41.871
I'm changing time in a photograph."
我改变了照片中的时间。”

61
00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:46.432
And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years
之后13年间，这个理念一直贯穿于我的作品之中，

62
00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:50.439
until technology finally has caught up to my dreams.
直到技术终于赶上了我的梦想。

63
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.324
This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
这是一张圣莫妮卡码头昼夜之间的照片。

64
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.629
And I'm going to show you a little video
下面我要放一个小短片

65
00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:01.126
that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me when I do these pictures.
让你们感受一下我的创作过程。

66
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.586
To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this,
首先你们得知道，要拍出这样的照片，

67
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.339
most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker
我大部分时间都得待在半空中，通常是在升降台

68
00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:09.514
or a crane.
或者吊车上。

69
00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:12.930
So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop
这是很普通的一天，连续拍摄12-18个小时，

70
00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:15.116
capturing the entire day unfold.
记录下完整的一天。

71
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.086
One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.
我喜欢观察人，所以我很享受这个过程。

72
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.523
And trust me when I tell you,
相信我，

73
00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:22.745
this is the greatest seat in the house to have.
半空中绝对是全场最好的位子。

74
00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:27.150
But this is really how I go about creating these photographs.
不过这就是我进行创作的真实场景。

75
00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:31.317
So once I decide on my view and the location,
一旦确认好取景范围和位置，

76
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.500
I have to decide where day begins and night ends.
我就要决定照片中的一天何时开始，何时结束。

77
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.666
And that's what I call the time vector.
我把这叫做时间矢量。

78
00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:40.579
Einstein described time as a fabric.
爱因斯坦把时间比作一块布料。

79
00:04:41.077 --> 00:04:43.455
Think of the surface of a trampoline:
你们想象一下蹦床的表面：

80
00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.066
it warps and stretches with gravity.
它会在重力的作用下弯曲和拉伸。

81
00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:49.538
I see time as a fabric as well,
我也把时间看做布料，

82
00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:54.891
except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.
只不过我把它平摊到一个二维平面上。

83
00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:57.114
One of the unique aspects of this work is also,
我的工作还有个特别的方面，

84
00:04:57.138 --> 00:04:58.638
if you look at all my pictures,
如果你细看我所有的照片，

85
00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:00.172
the time vector changes:
你会发现我的时间矢量是变化的：

86
00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:01.882
sometimes I'll go left to right,
有时从左往右，

87
00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:05.934
sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.
有时从近到远，从上到下，有时甚至沿对角线。

88
00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.806
I am exploring the space-time continuum
我在平面的静态照片中，

89
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.069
within a two-dimensional still photograph.
探索空间与时间的统一。

90
00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:14.838
Now when I do these pictures,
当我在创作这些作品时，

91
00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:17.814
it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.
就像在脑中同步拼一幅拼图。

92
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.228
I build a photograph based on time,
我以时间为轴创作照片，

93
00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:23.275
and this is what I call the master plate.
称之为模板。

94
00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.347
This can take us several months to complete.
整个创作过程通常花费数月完成。

95
00:05:26.946 --> 00:05:29.245
The fun thing about this work is
其有趣之处在于

96
00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:32.599
I have absolutely zero control when I get up there
我一旦踏上拍摄点

97
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:35.014
on any given day and capture photographs.
对拍摄对象就完全无法掌控。

98
00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:37.332
So I never know who's going to be in the picture,
我既不知道谁会被拍到

99
00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.339
if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control.
也不知道日出或日落是否迷人——完全控制不了。

100
00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:42.181
It's at the end of the process,
只有等拍摄完成，

101
00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:45.213
if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same,
我才知道当天拍得怎么样，有没有好的素材，

102
00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:47.846
that I then decide who's in and who's out,
然后我才能进行取舍，

103
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.605
and it's all based on time.
这一切都取决于时间。

104
00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.052
I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing
经过一个多月的编辑挑选，我选出最棒的瞬间，

105
00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:56.718
and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.
将它们无缝地拼接于模板之中。

106
00:05:57.988 --> 00:06:01.457
I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it,
我把自己眼中的白天和黑夜置于同一张图像中，

107
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.917
creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.
让这两个截然不同的世界和谐交融。

108
00:06:07.088 --> 00:06:10.926
Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work
绘画一直对我的作品有着深远影响，

109
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.661
and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt,
我很喜欢阿尔伯特·比茲塔特，

110
00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:15.519
the great Hudson River School painter.
他是一位哈德逊河画派的画家 。

111
00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:18.916
He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.
他启发了我最近拍摄的国家公园系列作品。

112
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.209
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
这是他画的《优胜美地河谷》。

113
00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.912
So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.
而这张是我在优胜美地河谷创作的图片。

114
00:06:25.247 --> 00:06:30.343
This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic.
这张照片后来被《国家地理》杂志甄用作为2016年1月刊的封面。

115
00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:34.167
I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.
我为这张照片持续拍摄了超过30个小时。

116
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.062
I was literally on the side of a cliff,
当时我真的就站在悬崖边上

117
00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:40.905
capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions,
捕捉星月交辉的变化，

118
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:42.784
the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
和洒在酋长岩上的月光。

119
00:06:42.808 --> 00:06:46.802
And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.
同时我也在固定的景致中捕捉时间的流动。

120
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:51.410
The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity
其中最棒的，无疑是在时光的流转中见证人类活动的

121
00:06:51.434 --> 00:06:52.738
as time changed --
一个个美好瞬间——

122
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:56.111
from day into night.
从早到晚，从不间断。

123
00:06:57.892 --> 00:06:59.430
And on a personal note,
在我的笔记本里，

124
00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:03.579
I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
一直夹着一张比兹塔特作品的副本。

125
00:07:03.603 --> 00:07:05.851
And when that sun started to rise in the valley,
当太阳从河谷中渐渐升起时，

126
00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:08.125
I started to literally shake with excitement
我为眼前的美景激动到颤抖，

127
00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.427
because I looked at the painting and I go,
我看着他的画，意识到，

128
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:15.657
"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting 100 years earlier."
“天啊，我眼前的光线效果，跟一百年前比兹塔特看到的，简直一模一样。”

129
00:07:17.577 --> 00:07:20.436
Day to Night is about all the things,
“昼夜之间”的主题覆盖了所有事物，

130
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.707
it's like a compilation of all the things I love
在摄影这种媒介中

131
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:24.867
about the medium of photography.
我所热爱的一切。

132
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:26.544
It's about landscape,
它关乎风景，

133
00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:28.167
it's about street photography,
关乎街头摄影，

134
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:30.493
it's about color, it's about architecture,
关乎色彩，也关乎建筑，

135
00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.634
perspective, scale -- and, especially, history.
关乎透视，比例，特别是历史。

136
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.192
This is one of the most historical moments
这张照片，在我所有的照片里，

137
00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:37.604
I've been able to photograph,
是最具历史意义的，

138

140

146
00:07:56.518 --> 00:08:00.590
There's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.
在拍摄这类题材的照片时，遇到的挑战不计其数。

147
00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:02.889
For this particular photograph,
我拍这张照片时，

148
00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:06.528
I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air
是在离地15米的一台剪叉式升降机里，

149
00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:07.846
and it was not very stable.
而且它不是很稳。

150
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.038
So every time my assistant and I shifted our weight,

151
00:08:11.062 --> 00:08:12.600
our horizon line shifted.
我们的水平线也跟着变化。

152
00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:14.243
So for every picture you see,

153
00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:16.656
and there were about 1,800 in this picture,

154
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.639
we both had to tape our feet into position

155
00:08:19.663 --> 00:08:21.806
every time I clicked the shutter.

156
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.998
(Applause)
（掌声）

157
00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:29.879
I've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work.
从这份工作之中，我收获无数。

158
00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:34.093
I think the two most important are patience

159
00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:36.299
and the power of observation.
和观察的力量。

160
00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:40.180
When you photograph a city like New York from above,
当我俯拍纽约这样的大都会时，

161
00:08:40.204 --> 00:08:42.318
I discovered that those people in cars

162
00:08:42.342 --> 00:08:44.652
that I sort of live with everyday,
那些原本我很熟悉的人群，

163
00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:46.732
they don't look like people in cars anymore.
在我看来已经面目全非了。

164
00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:49.234
They feel like a giant school of fish,

165
00:08:49.258 --> 00:08:51.218
it was a form of emergent behavior.
像一种新的行为模式。

166
00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:54.803
And when people describe the energy of New York,
人们常常说起纽约所蕴含的活力，

167
00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:57.763
I think this photograph begins to really capture that.
我认为这张图片确实有捕捉到这一点。

168
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.815
When you look closer in my work,
如果你仔细看这张图，

169
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.031
you can see there's stories going on.
你会发现这里面是有故事的。

170
00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:04.994
You realize that Times Square is a canyon,

171
00:09:05.018 --> 00:09:07.294
it's shadow and it's sunlight.
有阴影，也有阳光。

172
00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:10.901
So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.
于是我决定，在这一张照片中，把时间排成棋盘状。

173
00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.986
So wherever the shadows are, it's night
有阴影的地方是黑夜，

174
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.131
and wherever the sun is, it's actually day.

175
00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:18.523
Time is this extraordinary thing

176
00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:21.158
that we never can really wrap our heads around.
我们永远无法真正理解它。

177
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.762
But in a very unique and special way,

178

I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.

179

They embody a new metaphysical visual reality.

180
00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:37.570
When you spend 15 hours looking at a place,

181
00:09:38.737 --> 00:09:40.944
you're going to see things a little differently

182
00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:42.976
than if you or I walked up with our camera,

183
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.001
took a picture, and then walked away.

This was a perfect example.

185
00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:48.824
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."

186
00:09:49.487 --> 00:09:51.265
I watched over 15 hours

187
00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:53.837
all these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.

188
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:56.361
They were more interested in using it as a backdrop.

189
00:09:56.926 --> 00:09:59.754
They would walk up, take a picture,

190
00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:01.464

And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example,

a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is

versus what the human experience is evolving into.

194

The act of sharing has suddenly become more important

195
00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:22.503
than the experience itself.
更为重要了。

196
00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:26.477
(Applause)

197
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.637
And finally, my most recent image,

And this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera,

I went specifically during the peak migration

to hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.

204
00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:49.903
Unfortunately, when we got there,

205
00:10:49.927 --> 00:10:52.507
there was a drought going on during the peak migration,

I found this one watering hole,

I photographed for 26 hours

We saw, for 26 hours,

during the next 50 years.
