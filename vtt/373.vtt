00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.906
I want us to start by thinking about this device,
首先，我们都来想想这台设备，

2
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.984
the phone that's very likely in your pockets right now.
你口袋里现在很有可能就有这么一部手机。

3
00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:25.934
Over 40 percent of Americans  check their phones within five minutes of waking up every morning.
超过40%的美国人会在每天醒来后的五分钟内查看他们的手机。

4
00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.683
And then they look at it another 50 times during the day.
之后在当天剩下的时间里还会再看50次。

5
00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:33.544
Grownups consider this device to be a necessity.
成年人将手机视为生活必需品。

6
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.708
But now I want you to imagine it in the hands of a three-year-old,
但现在我要你们想象一下，如果这部手机在三岁小孩的手里，

7
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.386
and as a society, we get anxious.
整个社会是不是都会焦虑起来。

8
00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:47.666
Parents are very worried that this device is going to stunt their children's social growth;

9
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.355
that it's going to keep them from getting up and moving;
会让他们越来越少站起来活动，

10
00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.751
that somehow,
他们认为，

11
00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:54.666
this is going to disrupt childhood.
这会毁了孩子的童年。

12
00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:59.439
So, I want to challenge this attitude.

13
00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:02.295
I can envision a future

15
00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:12.822
These screens can get kids up and moving even more.
而这些屏幕能让孩子们更多地起来活动。

16
00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.935
They have the power to tell us more about what a child is learning than a standardized test can.
它们比标准化的考试更能向我们反映出孩子们学到了什么。

17
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.915
And here's the really crazy thought:
我甚至还有一种疯狂的想法：

18
00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.748
I believe that these screens have the power
我相信这些屏幕有能力

19
00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:28.763
to prompt more real-life conversations between kids and their parents.

20
00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:33.588
Now, I was perhaps an unlikely champion for this cause.
当然，我在这件事上也许没什么发言权。

21
00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:35.573
I studied children's literature
我过去研究过儿童文学，

22
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.131
because I was going to work with kids and books.

23

I had an experience that shifted my focus.

Maria had actually never seen a computer before.

28
00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:59.858
So the first thing I had to do was teach her how to use the mouse,

29
00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:05.312
and when I opened up the screen, she moved it across the screen,
在我点亮屏幕之后，她在屏幕上移动光标，

30
00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:08.571
and she stopped on a character named X the Owl.

31
00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:10.349
And when she did that,
她刚做完这个操作，

32
00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:14.165
the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.

and started waving frantically back at him.

35
00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:25.360
Her connection to that character was visceral.

36
00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.163
This wasn't a passive screen experience.

37
00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.753
This was a human experience.
而是一种人性的体验。

38
00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:35.106
And it was exactly appropriate for a three-year-old.
对于一个3岁的孩子来说是非常合适的。

39
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.795
I've now worked at PBS Kids for more than 15 years,

44
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.321
hold us back from realizing their potential in our children's lives.

It might be separating kids from one another.

51
00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:19.169
It might keep them away from the outside world.

52
00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:23.386
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,

games like these can teach us more about a child's cognitive learning

And in order to do that, you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.
为了做到这一点，你把平板电脑递给了3岁的孩子。

141
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.967
Now, this is a moment where you probably feel very guilty
也许这个时候，你会觉得非常愧疚，

142
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:28.390
about what you just did.
对于自己刚刚的所作所为。

143
00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:31.565
But now imagine this:
但想象一下：

144
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.639
Twenty minutes later, you receive a text message.
20分钟后，你收到一条短信。

145
00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:37.637
on that cell phone that's always within arm's reach.
就在你那台永远近在咫尺的手机上。

146
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.199
And it says: "Alex just matched five rhyming words.
短信说的是：“亚里克斯刚刚填对了5个押韵的词。

147
00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:44.066
Ask him to play this game with you.
让他跟你一起玩这个游戏吧。

148
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.914
Can you think of a word that rhymes with 'cat'?
你能想到一个跟‘猫’押韵的词吗？

149
00:08:47.763 --> 00:08:49.354
Or how about 'ball'?"
或者跟‘球’押韵？”

150
00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:54.344
In our studies, when parents receive simple tips like these,
我们的研究发现，如果父母收到这样的小提示，

151
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.013
they felt empowered.

152
00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.647
They were so excited

153
00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.295
to play these games at the dinner table with their kids.
能够跟孩子们在餐桌上一起玩游戏。

154
00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:01.921
And the kids loved it, too.

155
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.860
Not only did it feel like magic that their parents knew

156
00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:06.447
what they had been playing,

157
00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:09.766
kids love to play games with their parents.
而且他们喜欢跟父母一起玩游戏。

158
00:09:10.996 --> 00:09:16.951
Just the act of talking to kids about their media can be incredibly powerful.
仅仅跟孩子们讨论他们使用的媒体，这件事情本身就有令人难以置信的力量。

159
00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:20.974
Last summer, Texas Tech University published a study
去年夏天，德州理工大学公布了一项研究结果，

160
00:09:20.998 --> 00:09:24.360
that the show "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood" could promote
证明《小老虎丹尼尔》这档节目

the development of empathy among children.
可以促进孩子们的情感成长。

162
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.599
But there was a really important catch to this study:
但这个研究有一个重要的关键点：

163
00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:36.990
the greatest benefit was only when parents talked to kids about what they watched.
只有当父母跟孩子讨论他们所看的节目时，效果才会最好。

164
00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:39.014
Neither just watching
仅仅是看节目

165
00:09:39.038 --> 00:09:41.038
nor just talking about it was enough;
或者只谈不看，都不够，

166
00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.320
it was the combination that was key.
两者结合才是关键。

167
00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:46.487
So when I read this study,
因此，当我读到这项研究的时候，

168
00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:47.915
I started thinking about
我开始思考，

169
00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:53.192
how rarely parents of preschoolers actually talk to kids about the content
学龄前儿童的父母几乎很少跟孩子们讨论

170
00:09:53.216 --> 00:09:55.602
of what they're playing and what they're watching.
他们在玩什么或者他们在看什么。

171
00:09:55.626 --> 00:09:58.089
And so I decided to try it with my four-year-old.
于是我决定跟我4岁的孩子尝试一下。

172
00:09:58.113 --> 00:09:59.271
I said,
我说，

173
00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:02.726
"Were you playing a car game earlier today?"
“你今天是不是玩了一个汽车的游戏啊？”

174
00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:05.154
And Benjamin perked up and said,
本杰明振奋起来，说，

175
00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:09.023
"Yes! And did you see that I made my car out of a pickle?
“是呀！你看到我用腌黄瓜做的汽车了吗？

176
00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:11.134
It was really hard to open the trunk."

177
00:10:11.158 --> 00:10:12.816
(Laughter)
（笑声）

178
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.925
This hilarious conversation about what was fun in the game

179
00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:18.434
and what could have been better

180
00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:21.264
continued all the way to school that morning.
一路聊到他的学校门口。

181
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.735
I'm not here to suggest to you that all digital media is great for kids.
我今天并不是想说所有的电子媒体对孩子都好。

182
00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.445
There are legitimate reasons for us to be concerned

183
00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:36.196
about the current state of children's content on these screens.
如今的孩子们流连于各种屏幕不能自拔。

184
00:10:36.882 --> 00:10:39.657
And it's right for us to be thinking about balance:
我们也有理由考虑平衡的问题：

185
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.341
Where do screens fit against all the other things
怎样才能让电子产品融入

186
00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:46.459
that a child needs to do to learn and to grow?
孩子学习和成长所需要的其他事中？

187
00:10:48.078 --> 00:10:50.885
But when we fixate on our fears about it,
但是当我们一心担忧的时候，

188
00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.693
we forget a really major point,
我们忘记了很重要的一点，

189
00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:57.915
and that is, that kids are living in the same world that we live in,
孩子们跟我们同处一个世界，

190

在这个世界里，成年人看手机每天超过50次。

191
00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:06.512
Screens are a part of children's lives.
电子产品已经是孩子们生活的一部分。

192
00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.868
And if we pretend that they aren't,
如果我们不愿承认这一点，

193
00:11:10.892 --> 00:11:13.887
or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,
或者我们被担忧冲昏了头脑，

194
00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:18.320
kids are never going to learn how and why to use them.
孩子们就永远不会明白使用它们的原因和方法。

195
00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:24.366
What if we start raising our expectations for this media?

What if we start talking to kids regularly about the content on these screens?
我们何不经常跟孩子们讨论一下他们看的内容？

00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:36.693
What if we start looking for the positive impacts that this technology can have in our children's lives?
我们何不多考虑一下这种技术能给孩子们带来的正面影响？

198
00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:42.387
That's when the potential of these tools can become a reality.
到那时，这些工具的潜力才能得以实现。
