00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.923
What do you do when you have a headache?
当你头疼时你会怎么办？

2
00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:17.314
You swallow an aspirin.
你会吞下一片阿斯匹林。

3
00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:22.390
But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is,
但你头疼，这片药药效要到达你的头部，

4
00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:27.791
it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.
它先要经过胃、肠和许多其它器官。

5
00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:33.889
Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering
口服是最为有效且无痛的给药方式。

6
00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:35.915
any medication in the body.
口服是最为有效且无痛的给药方式。

7
00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:42.248
The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution.
但是不利之处在于，口服会导致药物稀释。

8
00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:48.579
And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients.
这可是一个大问题，尤其是对于HIV患者。

9
00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:51.756
When they take their anti-HIV drugs,
当他们使用抗HIV药物时，

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.846
these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood,
这些药物有助于降低血液中的病毒含量，

11
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.089
and increasing the CD4 cell counts.
并提升CD4细胞(人体免疫系统中的一种重要免疫细胞)计数，

12
00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:02.803
But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects,
但其副作用也是非常严重的，

13
00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:08.320
but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood,
而最大的问题在于，因为药物进入血液时已经稀释，

14
00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:11.221
and worse, by the time they get to the sites
到达目标位置时浓度更低。

15
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:16.707
where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs.
这里才是最重要的地方：HIV病毒潜伏处(病毒的储存宿主)。

16
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.094
These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes,
这些地方在身体里面--

17
00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:25.003
the nervous system, as well as the lungs --
诸如淋巴结、神经系统，以及肺部--

18
00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:27.531
where the virus is sleeping,
这里的病毒在休眠，

19
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.763
and will not readily get delivered in the blood
不会迅速进入病人的血液中，

20
00:01:30.787 --> 00:01:35.814
of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.
只要病人持续采用抗HIV药物治疗。

21
00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:40.008
However, upon discontinuation of therapy,
但是，当治疗中断时，

22
00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:43.689
the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.
病毒就会苏醒并感染血液中的新细胞。

23
00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:51.133
Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment,
如今，对于目前的HIV药物治疗，所有上述缺点成了一个大问题，

24
00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:55.191
which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients.
而病人必须终生服药。

25
00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.586
One day, I sat and thought,
有一天，我坐着突然想到：

26
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.347
"Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites,
“我们可不可以直接向病毒潜伏处中注入抗HIV药物，

27
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:05.948
without the risk of drug dilution?"
这样药物不会稀释？”

28
00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:10.938
As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes:
作为一名激光科学家，答案就在我眼前：

29
00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.772
Lasers, of course.
激光，当然了。

30
00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:15.660
If they can be used for dentistry,
如果激光可以应用于牙科，

31
00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:18.535
for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,
糖尿病伤口修复与外科手术，

32
00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.264
they can be used for anything imaginable,
那可以想到的任何领域都可以使用，

33
00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:24.552
including transporting drugs into cells.
包括直接向细胞注入药物。

34
00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:30.453
As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses
实际上我们已经在用激光脉冲

35
00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:34.106
to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,
在HIV感染的细胞上戳或钻出一个极小的孔，

36
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.042
which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells,
这些孔钻开后会立即关闭。

37
00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:41.336
in order to deliver drugs within them.
我们用这个办法向细胞中注入药物。

38
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.288
"How is that possible?" you may ask.
“这怎么可能？”你可能会问。

39
00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:51.272
Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam
嗯，我们将一束能量极高但极细的激光

40
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:55.100
onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells
照射在HIV感染细胞的细胞膜上，

41
00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:59.175
while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug.
这些细胞浸泡在含有药物的液体里，

42
00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:05.073
The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug
激光将细胞刺穿，

43
00:03:05.097 --> 00:03:06.935
in a matter of microseconds.
毫秒之间，细胞就吞下了药物。

44
00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:08.838
Before you even know it,
在你反应过来之前，

45
00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:11.886
the induced hole becomes immediately repaired.
钻出的孔又立即修复。

46
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:19.017
Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes,
现在，我们正在试管或培养皿里，测试这一技术，

47
00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:25.059
but the goal is to get this technology in the human body, apply it in the human body.
而目标是将这一技术应用于人体。

48
00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.631
"How is that possible?" you may ask.
“这怎么可能？”你可能会问。

49
00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:32.422
Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device.
嗯，我们使用的是一个三头仪器，

50
00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:36.248
Using the first head, which is our laser,
第一个头是激光头，

51
00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:39.429
we will make an incision in the site of infection.
用它在感染部位进行切割；

52
00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:42.946
Using the second head, which is a camera,
第二个头是摄像头，

53
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.197
we meander to the site of infection.
用来找到感染位置；

54
00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:50.400
Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,
最后，第三个头是喷药头，

55
00:03:50.424 --> 00:03:53.431
we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection,
用来直接向感染部位注入药物，

56
00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:57.556
while the laser is again used to poke those cells open.
同时用激光将细胞戳开一个孔。

57
00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:01.865
Well, this might not seem like much right now.
现在这个看起来还不成熟，

58
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.563
But one day, if successful, this technology can lead
但如果能够成功，

59
00:04:07.587 --> 00:04:10.816
to complete eradication of HIV in the body.
终有一天，可以用这项技术来彻底根除人体中的HIV。

60
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:13.586
Yes. A cure for HIV.
是的，治愈HIV。

61
00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:16.881
This is every HIV researcher's dream --
这是每个HIV研究者的梦想--

62
00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:20.432
in our case, a cure lead by lasers.
对我们来说，就是用激光来治愈。

63
00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:21.609
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

64
00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:23.568
