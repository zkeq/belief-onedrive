and I'm not talking about "Game of Thrones,"

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.916
but a horrifying, real-life drama

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.196
that's proved too fascinating to turn off.
它骇人听闻， 却有让人无法抵挡的强大吸引力。

6

It's a show produced by murderers

from a remote, obscure age,

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.636
then we're wrong.
那就大错特错了。

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.396
They were uniquely modern,

that millions of people would tune in to watch.

the polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways.

But that's the irony.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.276
We think a beheading has nothing to do with us,
我们以为就算点击观看了视频，

27
00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.140
even as we click on the screen to watch.

on our computer screens.

Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.276
But a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014,
但通过2014年8月在伦敦的一项调查，

41
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.140
estimated that 1.2 million people
可以粗略估算出 在对James Foley的处决视频

42
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.596
had watched the beheading of James Foley
发布之后的短短几天内，

43

in the few days after it was released.

had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown.
点开了视频， 但在受害者遇难前一刻退出了观看。

52

Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch,

53
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.596

as was customary at the time,

and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare.

96
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.876

freeze-framed in every detail.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.916
If we take a bigger leap back in history,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.196
and even when people are disgusted and are horrified,
就算真的感到恶心和恐惧，

142
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.260
it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch.
通常也并不妨碍他们加入围观人群。

143
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.636
Perhaps the most striking example
有关人们看到砍头，

144
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.955
of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved
却能保持无动于衷， 甚至感到还够不过瘾的

145
00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:49.316
and even be disappointed
最典型的事件，

146
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.443
was the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine,
恐怕是在1792年的法国， 那架著名的斩首机器，

147
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.036
that famous decapitation machine.
“断头台”的面世。

148
00:08:57.717 --> 00:09:00.364
To us in the 21st century,
对于21世纪的我们，

149
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.196
the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption,
断头台可能算得上是 骇人听闻的诡异装置，

150
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.380
but to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment.
但它却令它的第一批观众大失所望。

151
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.236
They were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold,
他们已经习惯于观看行刑台上 持续长时间的折磨，

152
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.716
where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly.
看着人们被砍断手脚、 活活烧死、慢慢撕裂。

153
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.716
To them, watching the guillotine in action,
对他们而言，断头台上的演出

154
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.916
it was so quick, there was nothing to see.
结束得太快了，没什么好看的。

155
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.156
The blade fell, the head fell into a basket, out of sight immediately,
刀身下落，头颅掉进一只篮子 就立刻不见了踪影，

156
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.876
and they called out,
于是他们喊道，

157
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.740
"Give me back my gallows, give me back my wooden gallows."
“还我们绞刑架！把木绞架抬回来！”

158
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.356
The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America
欧美范围内残酷的 公开司法处刑的终结，

159
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.316
was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal,
一部分是出于对罪犯的人道主义关怀，

160
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.076
but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave
但同时也是因为围观人群的行为举止

161
00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:57.111
in the way that they should.
着实太有悖常理和人性。

162
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.716
All too often, execution day
一而再，再而三的，

163
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.900
was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.
行刑日与其说是严肃的仪式， 不如说变成了狂欢节。

164
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.156
Today, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable,
今天，无论在欧洲还是美国， 一场公开处决已是不可想象的了，

165
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.916
but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious
但我们仍然无法简单地认为

166
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.996
about thinking that things are different now
一切都不同了，

167
00:10:13.782 --> 00:10:16.340
and we don't behave like that anymore.
这样的惨剧不会再重演了。

168
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.996
Take, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting.
我们不妨说说“诱导自杀”。

169
00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.976
This is when a crowd gathers
这指的是人们聚集起来

170
00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:27.505
to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building
围观那些爬上高层公共建筑顶楼

171
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.276
in order to kill themselves,
企图自杀的人，

172
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.276
and people in the crowd shout and jeer,
而人群中时常冒出

173
00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:35.380
"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"
“快点儿啊！”“跳下去啊！” 之类的叫嚷和嘲讽。

174
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.916
This is a well-recognized phenomenon.
这种现象早就屡见不鲜了。

175
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.196
One paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,
1981年的一篇论文指出， 每21起受到威胁的自杀行为中，

176
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.076
there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd.
就有10起出现了人群中的讥笑， 也就是所谓的诱导自杀。

177
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:56.459
And there have been incidents reported in the press this year.
今年的报纸中也出现过相关报道。

178
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.476
This was a very widely reported incident
这是今年3月在特尔福德和什罗普郡

179
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.476
in Telford and Shropshire in March this year.
被广泛报道的事件。

180
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.116
And when it happens today,
这种情况发生在当今，

181
00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:07.372
people take photographs and they take videos on their phones
人们通常会掏出手机拍照、摄像，

182
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.780
and they post those videos online.
再把影像上传到网络。

183
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.636
When it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos,
类似的，当残暴的刽子手在网上传播 录制好的斩首视频，

184
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.356
the Internet has created a new kind of crowd.
互联网又创造了一批新的围观人群。

185
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.396
Today, the action takes place in a distant time and place,
正因为这些事情发生在 触不可及的时间和地点，

186
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.716
which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening,
从而让观众产生了与之毫不相干的心理，

187
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.996
a sense of separation.
一种疏离感。

188
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.428
It's nothing to do with me.
“这和我没有关系”。

189
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.060
It's already happened.
“这一切已经发生了”。

190
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.756
We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy.
同时我们还获得了前所未有的亲密感。

191
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.476
Today, we are all offered front row seats.
我们仿佛身处贵宾席。

192
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.236
We can all watch in private, in our own time and space,
能够在空闲时间、私人空间里独自观看，

193
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:48.075
and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch.
并且没人知道我们到底浏览过什么。

194
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.316
This sense of separation --
这种疏离感——

195
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.316
from other people, from the event itself --
不论是与他人还是与事件本身——

196
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.916
seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch,
似乎成了理解我们为何能够观看 这些残暴行径的关键，

197
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.196
and there are several ways
而互联网通过

198
00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:01.240
in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment
产生疏离感而逐渐侵蚀

199
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.100
that seems to erode individual moral responsibility.
个人道德责任感的例子还有不少。

200
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.196
Our activities online are often contrasted with real life,
我们在网上的行为举止 往往与现实生活反差巨大，

201
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.300
as though the things we do online are somehow less real.
似乎互联网上的行为并不那么真实。

202
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.076
We feel less accountable for our actions
在网上，我们会觉得不必

203
00:12:16.774 --> 00:12:20.117
when we interact online.
对自己的行为负责。

204
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.556
There's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility,
由于网络匿名带来的隐形感，

205
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.220
so we feel less accountable for our behavior.
我们感到并不需要 为自己的言行负太多责任。

206
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.236
The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently,
在网上也更容易发现一些

207
00:12:32.957 --> 00:12:36.579
things that we would usually avoid in everyday life.
真实生活中我们会尽力避免的东西。

208
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.756
Today, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching.
现在，有些视频甚至在你还没意识到 在看什么的时候，就会开始播放。

209
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.796
Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life
又或者我们会浏览平时不会去关注，

210
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.940
or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time.
以及有旁人时不会去观看的内容。

211
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.836
And when the action is pre-recorded
于是，当整件事已经事先被拍摄，

212
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.076
and takes place in a distant time and space,
并发生在遥远的时空距离之外，

213
00:12:56.733 --> 00:13:00.727
watching seems like a passive activity.
观看貌似成为了一种被动行为。

214
00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:02.677
There's nothing I can do about it now.
“我现在对此无能为力”。

215
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.490
It's already happened.
“这一切已经发生了”。

216
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.276
All these things make it easier as an Internet user
所有这些都让作为 互联网用户的我们更轻易地

217
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:11.779
for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death,
屈从于自己对死亡的好奇，

218
00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:14.566
to push our personal boundaries,
拉低自己的个人道德底线，

219
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.780
to test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock.
去考验、去探究自己对冲击感的承受力。

220
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.516
But we're not passive when we watch.
然而事实上我们并非被动的观众。

221
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.036
On the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen.
恰恰相反， 正是我们在满足杀人犯的表现欲。

222
00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:32.119
When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless,
斩首中受害者被绑住无力反抗的时候，

223
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.020
he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show.
他或她本质上 已经变成了刽子手的表演道具。

224
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.196
Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle,
传统战争中作为战利品砍下的头颅，

225
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.540
that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight,
象征着胜者蒙受的上天眷顾 和超凡的战斗技能，

226
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.156
when a beheading is staged,
与此不同的是， 当斩首作为表演被呈上舞台，

227
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.738
when it's essentially a piece of theater,
当它已然成为一出戏剧，

228
00:13:51.738 --> 00:13:57.620
the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs.
这些罪犯的表演得到的反响， 正是操控力的来源。

229
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.436
In other words, watching is very much part of the event.
换言之，观看行为实际上是 这一事件中相当关键的部分。

230
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.996
The event no longer takes place in a single location
这件事不再如同以往 或是它今后仍将呈现出的那样，

231
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.180
at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to.
仅仅发生在特定的时间与地点。

232
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.956
Now the event is stretched out in time and place,
如今它在时空中得到了延伸，

233
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.940
and everyone who watches plays their part.
使得每一位观众都变成参与者。

234
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.220
We should stop watching,
我们真的应该拒绝观看。

235
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.500
but we know we won't.
但我们知道自己做不到。

236
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.716
History tells us we won't,
历史说我们做不到，

237
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.340
and the killers know it too.
刽子手们也对此一清二楚。

238
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.276
Thank you.
谢谢。

239
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.796
(Applause)
（掌声）

240
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.716
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you.
布鲁诺 吉桑尼(BG)： 谢谢。我来拿着这个吧。谢谢。

241
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.636
Let's move here. While they install for the next performance,
我们往前站一些。 趁着工作人员准备下一场演讲，

242
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.516
I want to ask you the question that probably many here have,
我想问一个可能在座很多人 都会好奇的问题，

243
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.140
which is how did you get interested in this topic?
为什么你会对这个话题感兴趣呢？

244
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.196
Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum
弗朗西斯 拉森 (FL): 我以前在一家博物馆工作，

245
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.156
called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,
牛津的皮特河博物馆，

246
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.749
which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America.
那里来自南美的头颅标本非常有名。

247
00:14:57.749 --> 00:15:01.627
People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!"
人们总说， “噢，头颅博物馆，头颅博物馆！”

248
00:15:01.627 --> 00:15:05.412
And at the time, I was working on the history
那时候我恰好在研究用于

249
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.676
of scientific collections of skulls.
科学方面的头骨收藏史。

250
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.276
I was working on the cranial collections,
正当我研究这些颅骨藏品时，

251
00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:12.050
and it just struck me as ironic
我突然意识到一件讽刺的事，

252
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.916
that here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture
人们到这儿来是想感受 他们可能在脑中构想过的

253
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.460
that they were almost fantasizing about and creating
血腥、残忍的原始文明，

254
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.161
without really understanding what they were seeing,
却从未真正理解他们眼前的展品，

255
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.516
and all the while these vast -- I mean hundreds of thousands
而一直以来我们博物馆里那些

256
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.916
of skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States --
遍及欧美大陆的数以万计的头骨藏品——

257
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.196
were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality.
从某种程度上说， 成为了推进思想启蒙运动的科学基础。

258
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.276
So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us."
所以我希望能够调转人们的目光， 来“看看我们自己”。

259
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.196
We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads.
我们和这些头颅标本一样， 都在透过玻璃罩子观察对方。

260
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.435
Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things.
让我们开始省视自己的历史文化， 以及对这些事物的想象吧。

261
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.597
BG: Thank you for sharing that.
BG：感谢你的演讲。

262
00:15:51.622 --> 00:15:52.796
