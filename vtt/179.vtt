2
00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:20.594
"I've just left my fingerprints all over my wine glass."
“我刚在红酒杯上留满了指纹”。

00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:21.619
(Laughter)
（笑声）

4
00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.488
Or do you ever worry, when you visit a friend,
或者你有没有担心，当你拜访朋友时，

5
00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:28.990
about leaving a little piece of you behind on every surface that you touch?
在每一个触碰中留下的那一丝痕迹？

6
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.163
And even this evening,
即便今天晚上，

7
00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:35.043
have you paid any attention to sit without touching anything?
你们坐下时有没有留意不触碰任何东西？

8
00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.555
Well, you're not alone.
好吧，并不只是你们如此。

9
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.824
Thankfully, criminals underestimate the power of fingerprints, too.
谢天谢地，犯罪分子也低估了指纹的力量。

10
00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:45.941
And I'm not just talking about the twisted parting of lines
我说的可不只是那一条条让我们的指纹

11
00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:49.073
that make our fingerprint unique.
独一无二的扭曲线条。

12
00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:53.392
I'm talking about an entire world of information

13
00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:57.080
hiding in a small, often invisible thing.
微小，常常不可见的物体中的信息世界。

14
00:00:57.538 --> 00:01:00.224
In fact, fingerprints are made up of molecules
事实上，组成指纹的分子

15
00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:01.991
that belong to three classes:

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:06.817
sweat molecules that we all produce in very different amounts ...
我们产生的数量非常不同的汗液分子…

17
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.272
molecules that we introduce into our body and then we sweat out

19
00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:18.575
when we come across substances like blood, paint, grease,
在我们遇到像血液，油漆，油脂那样的物质时，

20
00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.556
but also invisible substances.
但也有不可见的物质。

21
00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:26.059
And molecules are the storytellers of who we are

30
00:01:58.858 --> 00:02:01.515
who had been seen in that area on the same day.
超过20人中缩减而来。

31
00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:04.541
The only piece of evidence

33
00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.837
on the tape that was found wrapped around Katie's neck.
发现的两个非常模糊的、重叠的指纹。

34
00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:18.368
Often, faint and overlapping fingerprints cannot help the police

35
00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:20.335
to make an identification.
没有帮助。

36
00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.709
And until recently, this might have been the end of the road,

37
00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:27.932
but this is where we can make the difference.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:52.984
specifically for the molecular and imaging analysis of fingerprints.
分子和成像分析做了进一步的开发和适配。

45
00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:57.741
In essence, we fire a UV laser at the print,

46
00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:01.622
and we cause the desorption of the molecules from the print,
去引发指纹上的分子解吸，

47
00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:04.521
ready to be captured by the mass spectrometer.
为被质谱仪捕获做好准备。

48
00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:08.829
Mass spectrometry measures the weight of the molecules --

49
00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:11.147
or as we say, the mass --

50
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.689
and those numbers that you see there, they indicate that mass.
你看到的这些数字，它们表示质量。

51
00:03:15.713 --> 00:03:17.351
But more crucially,

52
00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:21.830
they indicate who those molecules are --
它们表示这些分子是谁——

53
00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:23.971
whether I'm seeing paracetamol
我看到的是对乙酰氨基酚

54
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.620
or something more sinister, forensically speaking.
或是从法医证物角度来说更罪恶的东西。

55
00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:31.570
We applied this technology to the evidence that we have
我们对证物采用这个技术

56
00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:35.422
and we found the presence of condom lubricants.
并从中发现了避孕套的润滑剂。

57
00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:40.785
In fact, we've developed protocols that enable us to even suggest
事实上，我们开发了一套流程让我们甚至可以知道

58
00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.102
what brand of condom might have been used.
使用什么牌子的避孕套。

59
00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:47.004
So we pass this information to the police,
于是我们把这个信息传达给警方，

60
00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:50.434
who, meanwhile, have obtained a search warrant
警方，同时已经取得了搜查证

61
00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:56.410
and they found the same brand of condom in Dalton's premises.
并在道尔顿的房子里发现了 同样牌子的避孕套。

62
00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.447
And with Dalton and Thomson also having records for sexual assaults,
鉴于道尔顿和汤姆森也有性侵犯的记录，

63
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:07.169
then it is Chapman that may become the less likely suspect.
那么，查普曼就不太可能成为嫌疑人。

64
00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.887
But is this information enough to make an arrest?
但这个信息足够去逮捕人了吗？

65
00:04:11.353 --> 00:04:12.504
Of course not,
当然不够，

66
00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:15.258
and we are asked to delve deeper with our investigation.
我们被要求深入我们的调查。

67
00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:20.780
So we found out, also, the presence of other two very interesting molecules.
于是我们也发现了另外两个 非常有趣的分子的存在。

68
00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:23.873
One is an antidepressant,
一种是抗抑郁药，

69
00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.919
and one is a very special molecule.
另一种是非常特殊的分子。

70
00:04:25.943 --> 00:04:28.068
It only forms in your body
如果你同时喝酒和吸食可卡因，

71
00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:32.126
if you drink alcohol and consume cocaine at the same time.
只会在你的身体中形成。

72
00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.389
And alcohol is known to potentiate the effects of cocaine,
众所周知，酒精会增强可卡因的作用，

73
00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:41.177
so here, we now have a hint on the state of mind
所以在这，我们现在有了一个

74
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:44.288
of the individual whilst perpetrating the crime.
关于个人心理状态的提示。

75
00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.996
We passed this information to the police,
我们把信息传递给警方，

76
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.304
and they found out that, actually, Thomson is a drug addict,
他们发现，事实上汤姆森是个瘾君子，

77
00:04:52.328 --> 00:04:56.558
and he also has a medical record for psychotic episodes,
而且他也有精神病发的医疗记录，

78
00:04:56.582 --> 00:05:00.353
for which presumably the antidepressant was prescribed.
大概是用抗抑郁药开的处方。

79
00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:05.613
So now Thomson becomes the more likely suspect.
所以现在汤姆森成为了更有可能的嫌疑人。

80
00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:12.776
But the reality is that I still don't know where these molecules are coming from,
但事实是，我仍然不知道 这些分子是从哪里来的，

81
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.546
from which fingerprint,
来自谁的指纹，

82
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.543
and who those two fingerprints belong to.
这两个指纹属于谁的。

83
00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.437
Fear not.
不要害怕。

84
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:22.276
Mass spectrometry imaging can help us further.
质谱成像可以帮助我们更进一步。

85
00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:25.828
In fact, the technology is so powerful

86
00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:30.899
that we can see where these molecules are on a fingerprint.
我们可以看到这些分子在指纹上的位置。

87
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:33.692
Like you see in this video,
如这个视频中所看到，

88
00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:37.594
every single one of those peaks corresponds to a mass,
每一个波峰都对应一个质量，

89
00:05:37.618 --> 00:05:39.690
every mass to a molecule,
每一个质量对应一个分子，

90
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:44.655
and we can interrogate the software, by selecting each of those molecules,
我们可以通过选择每一个分子，并查询这个软件，

91
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:48.329
as to where they are present on a fingermark.
来了解它们在一个手指上的位置。

92
00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:52.278
And some images are not very revealing,
有些照片不能说明问题，

93
00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:53.769
some are better,
有些更好些，

94
00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:56.255
some are really good.
有些真的很好。

95
00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:01.271
And we can create multiple images of the same mark --
我们可以创建相同标记的多个图像——

96
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:05.382
in theory, hundreds of images of the same fingerprint --
理论上，对于我们检测到的很多分子，

97
00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:08.464
for as many of the molecules that we have detected.
可以创建同个指纹的上百张图像。

98
00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:10.939
So step one ...
所以步骤1…

99
00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:16.067
for overlapping fingerprints, chances are,
对于重叠的指纹，很大可能性是，

100
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:18.612
especially if they come from different individuals,
特别是如果它们来自不同的个体，

101
00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:22.055
that the molecular composition is not identical,
分子组成是不一样的，

102
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:27.162
so let's ask the software to visualize those unique molecules
让我们让软件来可视化这些

103
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:31.060
just present in one fingermark and not in the other one.
只在一个手指上，而不在 另一个手指上的独特分子。

104
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.380
By doing so,
这样做，

105
00:06:33.404 --> 00:06:37.352
that's how we can separate the two ridge patterns.
这就是我们如何分离这两种嵴线类型的方法。

106
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.285
And this is really important
这真是非常重要，

107
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:46.334
because the police now are able to identify one of the two fingerprints,
因为警察现在就可以鉴定两个指纹中的一个，

108
00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:48.515
which actually corresponds to Katie.
其中正好和凯蒂的是相对应的。

109
00:06:49.188 --> 00:06:50.681
And they've been able to say so
他们现在可以这样说

110
00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:53.308
because they've compared the two separate images
是因为他们把这两张分开的图片

111
00:06:53.332 --> 00:06:56.013
with one taken posthumously from Katie.
跟死后的凯蒂上拍到的做了对比。

112
00:06:56.722 --> 00:07:01.915
So now, we can concentrate on one fingerprint only --
所以现在，我们可以聚焦在只有一个指纹上了——

113
00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:03.796
that of the killer's.
属于凶手的。

114
00:07:04.297 --> 00:07:06.288
So then, step two ...
然后，步骤2…

115
00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:09.556
where are these three molecules that I've seen?
我所见过的这三个分子在哪里？

116
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.318
Well, let's interrogate the software -- show me where they are.
好吧，让我们来查一下软件—— 告诉我它们在哪里。

117
00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:15.002
And by doing this,
通过这样做，

118
00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:21.307
only portions of the image of the killer's fingerprint show up.
只有凶手的部分指纹出现了。

119
00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:22.735
In other words,
换句话说，

120
00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:28.497
those substances are only present in the killer's print.
这些物质只存在于凶手的指纹中。

121
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.160
So now our molecular findings start matching very nicely
所以现在我们的分子发现开始很好地匹配

122
00:07:34.184 --> 00:07:36.885
the police intelligence about Thomson,
警察掌握的关于汤姆森的情报，

123
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:39.398
should that fingerprint belong to him.
那指纹应该属于他。

124
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.117
But the reality is that that print is still not good enough
但事实是这个指纹仍然不够好

125
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:46.189
to make an identification.
去做鉴定。

126
00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:47.614
Step three:
步骤3:

127
00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:54.302
since we can generate hundreds of images of the same fingerprint,
既然我们可以生成数百张相同指纹的图像，

128
00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:57.249
why don't we superimpose them,
我们为什么不把它们叠加起来呢，

129
00:07:57.273 --> 00:07:58.426
and by doing so,
通过这样做，

130
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.863
try to improve the rich pattern of continuity and clarity?
试着改善连续性和清晰性的丰富模式。

131
00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:03.387
That's the result.
这就是结果。

132
00:08:04.123 --> 00:08:05.525
Striking.
非常惊人。

133
00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:09.491
We now have a very clear image of the fingerprint
我们现在有了指纹的清晰图像，

134
00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:12.265
and the police can run it through the database.
警察已经可以在数据库中检索了。

135
00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:14.649
The match comes out to Thomson.
匹配结果显示是汤姆森。

136
00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:17.160
Thomson is our killer.
汤姆森就是凶手。

137
00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:21.152
(Applause)
（鼓掌）

138
00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:27.923
Katie, the suspects and the circumstances of the crime aren't real,
凯蒂、犯罪嫌疑人和犯罪现场都不是真实的，

139
00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:31.496
but the story contains elements
但这个故事包含了

140
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.867
of the real police casework we've been confronted with,
我们所遇到的真正的警察案件的元素，

141
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:39.057
and is a composite of the intelligence that we can provide --

142
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:41.612
that we have been able to provide the police.
情报信息的组合。

143
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.547
And I'm really, really thrilled that after nine years of intense research,
在9年的深入研究后，我真的真的非常激动，

144
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:49.532
as of 2017,
在2017年，

145
00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:52.662
we are able to contribute to police investigations.
