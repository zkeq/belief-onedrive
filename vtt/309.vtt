of what it is that we see.
我们所看到的事物。

7
00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:28.645
Let's just start with an example of that very fact.
让我先举一个例子来说明这个事实。

8
00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.655
I'm going to show you a photograph of a person,
我会让你们花几秒钟时间

9
00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.458
just for a second or two,
来观看一个人的照片,

10
00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.353
and I'd like for you to identify

11
00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:36.492
what emotion is on his face.

00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:42.763
Okay. What did you see?
好了，你们看到了什么？

15
00:00:42.763 --> 00:00:47.334
Well, we actually surveyed over 120 individuals,
事实上我们调查了一百二十多个人,

16
00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:49.284
and the results were mixed.
而调查结果很复杂。

17
00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:54.441
People did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face.
人们在所看到的情绪上面并没有达成共识。

18
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:56.246
Maybe you saw discomfort.
可能你看到了不安,

19
00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:58.235
That was the most frequent response
这是我们收到的

20
00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.490
that we received.
最常见的回答。

21
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.579
But if you asked the person on your left,
但是如果你问问你左边的人,

22
00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.320
they might have said regret or skepticism,
他们也许会说是遗憾或者怀疑。

23
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.249
and if you asked somebody on your right,
如果问的是右边的人,

24
00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:09.143
they might have said something entirely different,
他们的回答可能又完全不同，

25
00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:11.963
like hope or empathy.
比如说希望或者同情。

26
00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:16.624
So we are all looking at the very same face again.
那么我们现在再回到这张照片。

27
00:01:16.624 --> 00:01:20.435
We might see something entirely different,
我们可能会看到完全不同的东西。

28
00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.499
because perception is subjective.

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.667
What we think we see
我们认为自己所看到的东西

30
00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.513
is actually filtered through our own mind's eye.
事实上是经过我们思维的视角过滤过的。

31
00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:34.181
Of course, there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind's eye.
当然，还有很多其他例子能证明我们是如何通过主观思维的视角观察世界的。

32
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:35.963
I'm going to give you just a few.
再举几个这样的例子。

33
00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.623
So dieters, for instance,
比如说，节食者

34
00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:43.661
see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories.
眼中的苹果会比不节食的人眼中的更大。

35
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:47.294
Softball players see the ball as smaller
当垒球运动员从他的低迷状态中恢复的时候,

36
00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:52.993
if they've just come out of a slump, compared to people who  had a hot night at the plate.
相比起那些手感火热的运动员会感觉球更小。

37
00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:55.943
And actually, our political beliefs also
事实上，我们的政治信仰

38
00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:58.185
can affect the way we see other people,
也会影响我们观察其他人，

39
00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.358
including politicians.
包括政治家。

40
00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:04.051
So my research team and I decided to test this question.
所以我和我的研究团队决定探索这个问题。

41
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:09.081
In 2008, Barack Obama was running for president for the very first time,
在2008年，巴拉克-奥巴马正在第一次竞选总统。

42
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:12.063
and we surveyed hundreds of Americans

45
00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:18.271

voted for Obama in the actual election.
在选举中投票给了奥巴马。

50
00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.616
Other people, though, thought photographs like these

51
00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:33.905
best reflect how Obama really looks.
奥巴马看起来更真实，

52
00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:37.702
89 percent of these people voted for McCain.
他们中的89％ 投票给了麦凯恩。

53
00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:42.805
We presented many photographs of Obama one at a time,
我们把许多奥巴马的照片每次逐张地展示,

54
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:45.704
so people did not realize that what we were changing
所以人们并没有意识到，

55
00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:47.557
from one photograph to the next
在这些照片中

56
00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:52.161
was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone.
我们只是人为地调亮或调暗了他的肤色。

57
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:53.721
So how is that possible?
那么这是为什么呢？

58
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.556
How could it be that when I look at a person,
为什么当我观察一个人,

59
00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:58.277
an object, or an event,

60
00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:02.081
I see something very different than somebody else does?
我所看到的与其他人非常不同呢？

61
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.371
Well, the reasons are many,
原因有很多。

62
00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:06.622
but one reason requires that we understand
其中的一个要求我们了解一些

63
00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:09.175
a little bit more about how our eyes work.
眼睛的工作原理。

64
00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:11.184
So vision scientists know
视觉科学家们知道

65
00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:12.667
that the amount of information
我们的视觉

66
00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:16.377
that we can see at any given point in time,
在任意给定时刻所掌握的信息量，

67
00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:19.074
what we can focus on, is actually relatively small.
我们所能聚焦的范围其实是很少的。

68
00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.803
What we can see with great sharpness
我们在保证较高的锐利度，

69
00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.980
and clarity and accuracy
清晰度和准确度下所能看到的范围，

70
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.438
is the equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm.
等同于 把胳膊伸直时大拇指那么大,

71
00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:32.577
Everything else around that is blurry,
这片区域周围的一切都是模糊的，

72
00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:37.662
rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous.
导致大部分呈现在眼中的事物都是模糊的。

73
00:03:37.662 --> 00:03:39.936
But we have to clarify
但是我们必须进行辨认,

74
00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:42.184
and make sense of what it is that we see,
以识别出我们看到的是什么。

75
00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:45.569
and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap.
这时大脑就会帮助我们填补缺失的信息,

76
00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.138
As a result, perception is a subjective experience,
结果就是，感觉变得很主观，

77
00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:52.825
and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye.
这就是我们如何通过思维的视角进行观察的。

78
00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:54.638
So, I'm a social psychologist,
我是一个社会心理学家，

79
00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:56.155
and it's questions like these
所以这样的问题

80
00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:57.868
that really intrigue me.
会让我非常感兴趣。

81
00:03:57.868 --> 00:03:59.519
I am fascinated by those times
每当人们看到的东西不一样时，

82
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.016
when people do not see eye to eye.
我都会觉得非常有趣。

83
00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:03.713
Why is it that somebody might

84
00:04:03.713 --> 00:04:06.325
literally see the glass as half full,

85
00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:09.276
and somebody literally sees it as half empty?

86
00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:12.397
What is it about what one person is thinking and feeling
到底是什么使得一个人所看到和感觉到的

87
00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:16.304
that leads them to see the world in an entirely different way?
让他们从完全不同的角度观察这个世界呢？

88
00:04:16.304 --> 00:04:18.767
And does that even matter?
这真的很重要吗？

89
00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:21.818
So to begin to tackle these questions,
那么为了回答这个问题,

90
00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:24.457
my research team and I decided to delve deeply
我和我的研究团队决定更加深入研究

91
00:04:24.457 --> 00:04:28.225
into an issue that has received international attention:
一个引起了国际关注的问题：

92
00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:29.948
our health and fitness.
我们的健康和健身。

93
00:04:29.948 --> 00:04:31.306
Across the world,
全世界的人

94
00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:33.708
people are struggling to manage their weight,
都在为了控制体重而奋斗。

95
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.922
and there is a variety of strategies
并且有许多不同的方式

96
00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:39.279
that we have to help us keep the pounds off.
可以帮助我们减轻体重。

97
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:45.082
For instance, we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays,
例如我们会寄希望于在节假日之后进行锻炼。

98
00:04:45.082 --> 00:04:47.680
but actually, the majority of Americans
但事实上，大部分美国人

99
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.778
find that their New Year's resolutions are broken by Valentine's Day.
都会遗憾的发现他们的新年变革之梦在情人节的时候就磨灭了。

100
00:04:52.778 --> 00:04:55.974
We talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways,
我们会告诉自己并鼓励自己说,

101
00:04:55.974 --> 00:04:59.508
telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape,
今年就是我们成功恢复体型的时候。

102
00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:03.085
but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight.
但是这并不足以使我们真的恢复理想体重。

103
00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:04.921
So why?
那么为什么呢？

104
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.004
Of course, there is no simple answer,
当然了，答案很复杂。

105
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:09.767
but one reason, I argue,
但是我认为，其中一个原因,

106
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:13.294
is that our mind's eye might work against us.
是我们的思维视角可能会阻碍我们的努力。

107
00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:17.979
Some people may literally see exercise as more difficult,
有些人可能会认为锻炼是个相当困难的过程,

108
00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.100
and some people might literally see exercise as easier.
而有些人则会认为它其实很容易。

109
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.848
So, as a first step to testing these questions,
所以，为了解决这些问题, 首先

110
00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:30.957
we gathered objective measurements of individuals' physical fitness.
我们为人们的体型状况找出了客观的生理指标。

111
00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:33.299
We measured the  circumference of their waist,
我们测量了他们的腰围,

112
00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.555
compared to the  circumference of their hips.
并将之与他们的臀围做对比。

113
00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:40.207
A higher waist-to-hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit
较高的腰臀比与较低的腰臀比相比,

114
00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:42.279
than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
健康状况更不理想。

115
00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.506
After gathering these measurements,
得到了这些测量数据之后,

116
00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:49.786
we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight
我们要求我们的研究对象带着负重走向一条终点线，

117
00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:50.943
in a sort of race.
就像赛跑那样。

118
00:05:50.943 --> 00:05:52.730
But before they did that,
但是在他们开始之前,

119
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.857
we asked them to estimate the distance to the finish line.
我们让他们估计到终点线的距离。

120
00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:59.153
We thought that the physical states of their body
我们认为他们的身体状况

121
00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:02.638
might change how they perceived the distance.
可能会影响他们对距离的估计。

122
00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:04.398
So what did we find?
我们发现了什么呢？

123
00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:10.122
Well, waist-to-hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance.
事实上，腰臀比预示了他们对距离的估测。

124
00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:12.752
People who were out of shape and unfit
与体型状况更好的人相比

125
00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:14.850
actually saw the distance to the finish line
那些身材走型的人，

126
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.904
as significantly greater than people who were in better shape.
会认为到终点的距离更远。

127
00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:19.945
People's states of their own body
人们的身体状况

128
00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:23.181
changed how they perceived the environment.
影响了他们观察环境的方式。

129
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.297
But so too can our mind.
但我们的大脑也可以。

130
00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.206
In fact, our bodies and our minds
事实上，我们的身体和大脑

131
00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:31.791
work in tandem to change how we see the world around us.
会共同影响我们对世界的观察。

132
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.886
That led us to think that maybe people
这使得我们想到

133
00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:36.984
with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise
或许那些有强烈动机去运动的人们，

134
00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:43.856
might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations.
相比起动机较弱的人们会认为终点线更近。

135
00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:46.198
So to test whether motivations
所以为了测试

136
00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:49.550
affect our perceptual experiences in this way,
动机是否会这样影响我们的观察,

137
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.473
we conducted a second study.
我们进行了第二项研究。

138
00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:56.158
Again, we gathered objective measurements of people's physical fitness,
我们又一次收集了人们体型状况的测量数据,

139
00:06:56.158 --> 00:06:59.984
measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips,
包括了他们的腰围和臀围，

140
00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:03.349
and we had them do a  few other tests of fitness.
我们还让他们做了其他健康状况的测试。

141
00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.892
Based on feedback that we gave them,
基于我们的反馈,

142
00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.457
some of our participants told us
一些研究参与者告诉我们,

143
00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:09.765
they're not motivated to exercise any more.
他们没有继续锻炼的动力了。

144
00:07:09.765 --> 00:07:12.159
They felt like they already met their fitness goals
他们感觉已经达到了健康目标,

145
00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.292
and they weren't going to do anything else.
不想继续锻炼下去了。

146
00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:15.911
These people were not motivated.
这些人是没有动机的人。

147
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:18.053
Other people, though,  based on our feedback,
但是另一些人基于我们的反馈,

148
00:07:18.053 --> 00:07:20.338
told us they were highly  motivated to exercise.
告诉我们他们非常想要继续锻炼。

149
00:07:20.338 --> 00:07:23.050
They had a strong goal to make it to the finish line.
他们想要到达终点的目的性很强。

150
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.047
But again, before we had them walk to the finish line,
但是在他们开始走向终点线之前，

151
00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:28.017
we had them estimate the distance.
我们又要求他们估计到终点的距离,

152
00:07:28.017 --> 00:07:29.765
How far away was the finish line?
他们到终点的距离有多远呢？

153
00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:32.127
And again, like the previous study,
再一次，就像之前的研究那样,

154
00:07:32.127 --> 00:07:35.921
we found that waist-to-hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance.
我们发现腰臀比预示了他们对距离的估测。

155
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:40.553
Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther,
体型较差的人

156
00:07:40.553 --> 00:07:42.523
saw the finish line as farther away,
相比体型较好的来说,

157
00:07:42.523 --> 00:07:44.470
than people who were in better shape.
认为到终点的距离更远。

158
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.479
Importantly, though, this only happened
重要的是，这个现象只发生在

159
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:50.032
for people who were not motivated to exercise.
那些没有强烈的运动动机的人中间。

160
00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:51.622
On the other hand,
另一方面，

161
00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:54.666
people who were highly motivated to exercise
运动动机很强烈的人,

162
00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.863
saw the distance as short.
认为到终点的距离很近。

163
00:07:56.863 --> 00:07:59.190
Even the most out of shape individuals
甚至他们中最胖的人

164
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.252
saw the finish line as just as close,
看待终点线也是一样近，

165
00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:06.743
if not slightly closer, than people who were in better shape.
甚至会比其他身材更好的人还要近一点。

166
00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:08.702
So our bodies can change
也就是说我们的身体,

167
00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:10.940
how far away that finish line looks,
可以改变终点看起来的距离，

168
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.859
but people who had committed to a manageable goal
而那些有着明确的、

169
00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:16.968
that they could accomplish in the near future
可以在短时间内达到的目标的人,

170
00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:20.758
and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal
和那些相信自己有能力达到目标的人，

171
00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:24.174
actually saw the exercise as easier.
会认为这种锻炼更加轻松。

172
00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:26.084
That led us to wonder,
这使我们想到，

173
00:08:26.084 --> 00:08:30.891
is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help
我们可否可以借助某种方法来帮助人们,

174
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:33.160
change their perceptions of the distance,
改变他们对距离的估测，

175
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.641
help them make exercise look easier?
使锻炼看起来容易一些呢？

176
00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:40.021
So we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do,
所以我们转向视觉科学的资料来试着找到这种方法，

177
00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:42.503
and based on what we read, we came up with a strategy
基于这些资料我们想到了一种方法。

178
00:08:42.503 --> 00:08:45.881
that we called, "Keep  your eyes on the prize."
我们称它为“聚焦奖赏”。

179
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:47.692
So this is not the slogan
这并不是来自某张

180
00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:49.577
from an inspirational poster.
鼓励性海报的标语。

181
00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:51.825
It's an actual directive
这是一个确切的指令,

182
00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:54.747
for how to look around your environment.
告诉你如何观察四周的环境。

183
00:08:54.747 --> 00:08:57.039
People that we trained in this strategy,
根据这种方法训练的一些人,

184
00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:00.913
we told them to focus their attention on the finish line,
我们告诉他们要专注于终点线，

185
00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:02.749
to avoid looking around,
不要四处张望，

186
00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:04.090
to imagine a spotlight

187
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.703
was shining on that goal,
就在目标那里闪烁着,

188
00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:08.192
and that everything around it was blurry
聚光点周围的一切都应该是模糊的，

189
00:09:08.192 --> 00:09:09.998
and perhaps difficult to see.
无法辨认的。

190
00:09:09.998 --> 00:09:12.169
We thought that this strategy
我们认为这个方法

191
00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:14.662
would help make the exercise look easier.
可以让做运动感觉要容易一些。

192
00:09:14.662 --> 00:09:17.939
We compared this group to a baseline group.
我们把这个组的人和对照组的人比较。

193
00:09:17.939 --> 00:09:19.144
To this group we said,
我们跟这个组的人说

194
00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:20.731
just look around the environment
随便看看四周,

195
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:21.980
as you naturally would.

You will notice the finish line,
你会注意到终点线，

197
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.243
but you might also notice
但可能也会看到

198
00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:27.112
the garbage can off to the right,
终点线右边的垃圾桶,

199
00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:29.398
or the people and the  lamp post off to the left.
或者是左边的人和灯柱。

200
00:09:29.398 --> 00:09:34.185
We thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther.
我们认为运用这个方法的人们会觉得距离更远一点。

201
00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:36.632
So what did we find?
那么我们发现了什么呢？

202
00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:38.605
When we had them estimate the distance,
当我们让他们预测距离时,

203
00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:40.353
was this strategy successful
这个方法是否能成功的

204
00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:42.853
for changing their perceptual experience?
改变他们对距离的感知呢？

205
00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:44.051
Yes.
答案是可以的。

206
00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.256
People who kept their eyes on the prize
那些把注意力放在奖赏上的人,

207
00:09:46.256 --> 00:09:52.196
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would.
看到的终点线，比那些放眼四周的人要近30%。

208
00:09:52.196 --> 00:09:53.504
We thought this was great.
我们对这个结果很满意。

209
00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:58.758
We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier,
我们非常激动，因为这意味着这个方法可以让做运动看起来更简单，

210
00:09:58.758 --> 00:10:00.692
but the big question was,
但最重要的问题来了，

211
00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:03.920
could this help make exercise actually better?
它能让做运动变得更有效吗？

212
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.466
Could it improve the quality of exercise as well?
它能否提高运动的质量呢？

213
00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:09.729
So next, we told our participants,
所以下一步，我们告诉参与者，

214
00:10:09.729 --> 00:10:13.851
you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight.
你们将在负重的情况下走向终点线。

215
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:15.871
We added weights to their ankles
我们在脚踝那里给他们加重,

216
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:18.568
that amounted to 15 percent of their body weight.
重量是他们体重的15%,

217
00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:20.516
We told them to lift their knees up high

218
00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:22.735
and walk to the finish line quickly.

219
00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:24.895
We designed this exercise in particular

220
00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.617
to be moderately challenging
让它具有一定挑战性,

221
00:10:26.617 --> 00:10:28.394

222
00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.654
like most exercises

223
00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:32.496
that actually improve our fitness.
可以提升我们的体型，

224
00:10:32.496 --> 00:10:35.156
So the big question, then:
那么问题就是：

225
00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:37.268
Did keeping your eyes on the prize
把焦点放在奖品上,

226
00:10:37.268 --> 00:10:39.600
and narrowly focusing on the finish line

227
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.365
change their experience of the exercise?
会改变运动的体验吗？

228
00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:43.960
It did.
答案是肯定的。

People who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required
那些专注于奖赏的人后来告诉我们，

230
00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:51.774
17 percent less exertion for them to do this exercise

231
00:10:51.774 --> 00:10:55.213
than people who looked around naturally.
要少了17%。

232
00:10:55.213 --> 00:10:58.900
It changed their subjective experience of the exercise.
这改变了他们做运动的主观体验,

233
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.211
It also changed the objective nature of their exercise.

234
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:05.459
People who kept their eyes on the prize
那些专注于奖赏的人，

235
00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:11.555
actually moved 23 percent faster than people who looked around naturally.
比平时着眼四周的人，敏捷性提高了23%。

236
00:11:11.555 --> 00:11:13.237
To put that in perspective,
换个方式说,

237
00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:14.910
a 23 percent increase
23%的增长

238
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.795
is like trading in your 1980 Chevy Citation

239
00:11:18.795 --> 00:11:23.439
for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.

240
00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:25.951
We were so excited by this,
我们对此感到很激动。

241
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.118

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:35.396
or struggling to get there,

246
00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:36.836
had a big effect.
都有极大的效果。

247
00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:38.393
Keeping your eyes on the prize
专注于奖赏，

248
00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:41.337
made the exercise look and feel easier
可以让做运动看起来和感觉上更容易。

249
00:11:41.337 --> 00:11:43.895
even when people were working harder
由于敏捷性更高了，所以对那些

250
00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:46.114
because they were moving faster.
更加努力的人也同样适用。

251
00:11:46.114 --> 00:11:51.106
Now, I know there's more to good health than walking a little bit faster,
我知道健康的概念不仅仅是走得快一些。

252
00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:54.921
but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy

253
00:11:54.921 --> 00:11:58.845
that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle.

254
00:11:58.845 --> 00:12:00.926
If you're not convinced yet
如果你对此还抱有疑问,

255
00:12:00.926 --> 00:12:03.446
that we all see the world through our own mind's eye,
怀疑我们是否真的通过思维的视角来看世界，

256
00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:05.473
let me leave you with one final example.
那么我再举最后一个例子。

257
00:12:05.473 --> 00:12:08.896
Here's a photograph of a beautiful  street in Stockholm, with two cars.
这是一张斯德哥尔摩街头美景的照片，还有两辆车。

258
00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:12.513
The car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front.
后面那辆车看起来比前面的大得多。

259
00:12:12.513 --> 00:12:14.119
However, in reality,
但是，事实上

260
00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:16.498
these cars are the same size,
这两辆车都一样大。

261
00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:19.393
but that's not how we see it.
但我们看到的并不是这样。

262
00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:21.517
So does this mean that
难道这表明

263
00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:23.231
our eyes have gone haywire
我们的眼睛出毛病了，

264
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:25.801
and that our brains are a mess?
我们的大脑也混乱了？

265
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:28.373
No, it doesn't mean that at all.
不，完全不是这样。

266
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.394
It's just how our eyes work.
这只是眼睛的工作原理。

267
00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:33.083
We might see the world in a different way,
我们可能用不同的方式看世界，

268
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:36.921
and sometimes that might not line up with reality,
有时看到的和事实并不相符。

269
00:12:36.921 --> 00:12:39.046
but it doesn't mean that one of us is right
但这并不代表我们中间某个人就是对的，

270
00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:41.141
and one of us is wrong.
另一个就是错的。

271
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:43.277
We all see the world through our mind's eye,
我们其实都是以思维的视角来看世界。

272
00:12:43.277 --> 00:12:46.128
but we can teach ourselves to see it differently.
但我们能主动学会用不同的方法去看。

273
00:12:46.128 --> 00:12:49.986
So I can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me.
我能够回忆起那些曾经很糟糕的日子，

274
00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:52.382
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,
我感到厌倦，暴躁，疲惫，

275
00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:53.922
and I'm so behind,
完全跟不上节奏，

276
00:12:53.922 --> 00:12:56.328
and there's a big black cloud
在我的头顶上

277
00:12:56.328 --> 00:12:57.811
hanging over my head,
还有一大片乌云笼罩，

278
00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.245
and on days like these,

279
00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.120
it looks like everyone around me

is down in the dumps too.

00:13:03.254 --> 00:13:04.987
My colleague at work looks annoyed

00:13:04.987 --> 00:13:07.697
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,
他看起来很恼火，

283
00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:09.675
and my friend looks frustrated
当我约了朋友吃午饭但因开会迟到时，

284
00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:12.374
when I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long,
他看起来很不爽，

285
00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:13.967
and at the end of the day,
当结束了一天的工作,

286
00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:15.993
my husband looks disappointed
因为我想早点睡觉不想去看电影，

287
00:13:15.993 --> 00:13:18.526
because I'd rather go to  bed than go to the movies.
我的丈夫看起来就很失望。

288
00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:23.551
And on days like these, when everybody looks upset and angry to me,
像这样的日子每个人看起来都对我不爽。

289
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:26.769
I try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them.
我试着开解自己，或许有别的方法来看待他们，

290
00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:30.079
Perhaps my colleague was confused,
可能我的同事只是感到困惑,

291
00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:32.515
perhaps my friend was concerned,
可能我的朋友只是担心,

292
00:13:32.515 --> 00:13:35.782
and perhaps my husband was  feeling empathy instead.
可能我的丈夫只是对我感到同情。

293
00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:37.676
So we all see the world
所以我们都是

294
