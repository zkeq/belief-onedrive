00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.388
By raising your hand,
在座各位

2
00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:19.027
how many of you know at least one person on the screen?
知道至少一个屏幕中所示的人，请举手

3
00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.054
Wow, it's almost a full house.
哇，基本上每个人都举手了

4
00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.635
It's true, they are very famous in their fields.
没错，他们在各自的领域都十分有名

5
00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.654
And do you know what all of them have in common?
你们知道他们有什么共同点吗？

6
00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:30.598
They all died of pancreatic cancer.
他们都死于胰腺癌

7
00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:33.130
However, although it's very, very sad this news,
尽管这特别特别可悲

8
00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:35.918
it's also thanks to their personal stories
但也正是由于他们的自身经历

9
00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:40.063
that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be.
让我们意识到胰腺癌有多致命

10
00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:43.463
It's become the third cause of cancer deaths,
胰腺癌已成为癌症致死的第三大原因

11
00:00:43.487 --> 00:00:49.013
and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years.
病人的五年及以上存活率只有百分之八

12
00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:50.956
That's a very tiny number,
这个比例是极小的

13
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.200
especially if you compare it with breast cancer, where the survival rate is almost 90 percent.
尤其是和存活率接近90%的乳腺癌相比

14
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:02.622
So it doesn't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
所以，被诊断得了胰腺癌

15
00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:05.923
means facing an almost certain death sentence.
意味着几乎是被判了死刑这也就不足为怪了

16
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:09.567
What's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years,
然而，让人震惊的是

17
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:11.819
this number hasn't changed a bit,
在过去的40年，这个数字一点都没有变

18
00:01:11.993 --> 00:01:15.808
while much more progress has been made with other types of tumors.
而其它肿瘤的治疗已经有了长足进步

19
00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:20.032
So how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective?
那么我们该如何让胰腺癌治疗更有效呢？

20
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.385
As a biomedical entrepreneur,
作为一名生物医学企业家

21
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.428
I like to work on problems that seem impossible,
我希望去解决那些看起来不可能解决的问题

22
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.513
understanding their limitations
了解那些问题的限制因素

23
00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:32.464
and trying to find new, innovative solutions that can change their outcome.
并找到新的、创新的解决方案去改变结果

24
00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:35.432
The first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer
第一个关于胰腺癌的坏消息是

25
00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:38.927
is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally.
胰腺正好位于腹部的中间位置

26
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.786
It's depicted in orange on the screen.
如屏幕上橙色部分所示

27
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.457
But you can barely see it
但是如果我不把胰腺前面的其它器官移开

28
00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:46.441
until I remove all the other organs in front.
你几乎看不到它

29
00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.909
It's also surrounded by many other vital organs,
而且它被很多其它重要的器官包围着

30
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:53.045
like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct.
譬如肝、胃、胆管

31
00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.482
And the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs
肿瘤会扩散到这些器官

32
00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.528
is the reason why pancreatic cancer
这也胰腺癌是最痛苦的肿瘤之一的原因

33
00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:03.825
is one of the most painful tumor types.
另外，胰腺难以企及的位置

34
00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:07.020
The hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor from surgically removing it,
使得医生很难采取例行的治疗方式

35
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:10.079
as is routinely done for breast cancer, for example.
例如对肺癌，通过手术摘除肿瘤

36
00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:13.920
So all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option
上述各种原因

37
00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.953
for the pancreatic cancer patient.
使得化疗成为了胰腺癌患者的唯一选择

38
00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.018
This brings us to the second piece of bad news.
第二个坏消息是

39
00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.007
Pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels.
胰腺癌肿瘤的血管极少

40
00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:27.230
Why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor?
为什么我们要关心肿瘤的血管呢？

41
00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:30.720
Let's think for a second how chemotherapy works.
让我们想想化疗的过程

42
00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.633
The drug is injected in the vein
药物被注入静脉

43
00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:37.301
and it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site.
然后流遍整个身体直到到达肿瘤处

44
00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:41.500
It's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination.
这就像在高速路上行驶努力到达目的地一样

45
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.785
But what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway?
如果你的目的地在高速路上没有出口怎么办？

46
00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.438
You will never get there.
你将永远到不了目的地

47
00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:52.301
And that's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
对于化疗和胰腺癌来说也一样

48
00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.784
The drugs navigate throughout all of your body.
药物流遍你的整个身体

49
00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.221
They will reach healthy organs,
它们进入了健康器官

50
00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:02.052
resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall,
给病人整体带来很高的毒副作用

51
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.412
but very little will go to the tumor.
但是极少药物作用到肿瘤

52
00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:07.043
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.
因此治疗效果很有限

53
00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:15.441
To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment to target a specific organ.
我认为，为了治疗某一个器官而对全身采取治疗是非常有悖常理的

54
00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:17.917
However, in the last 40 years,
然而，在过去的40年里

55
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:22.265
a lot of money, research and effort have gone towards
大量的金钱、研究、努力被投入到

56
00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:26.372
finding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer,
找寻新的、药效更强的治疗胰腺癌的药物

57
00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:30.894
but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient.
而对于改变治疗病人的手段却没有任何投入

58
00:03:32.217 --> 00:03:33.843
So after two pieces of bad news,
说完两个坏消息

59
00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.896
I'm going to give you good news, hopefully.
我想告诉你们一个好消息，希望是的

60
00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:42.016
With a collaborator at MIT and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston,
通过麻省理工大学和位于波士顿的麻省总医院的合作研究

61
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.953
we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer
我们已经革新了治疗癌症的方式

62
00:03:44.977 --> 00:03:48.320
by making localized drug delivery a reality.
使得定位给药成为现实

63
00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:52.780
We are basically parachuting you on top of your destination,
总的来说就是，我们用降落伞将你在目的地上方直接投送出去

64
00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:55.706
avoiding your having to drive all around the highway.
避免你得在高速路上七拐八拐

65
00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.020
We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one.
我们将药物嵌入类似这样的装置中

66
00:04:01.044 --> 00:04:08.179
They are flexible enough that they can be folded to fit into the catheter,
它们极为柔软可以将它们折叠放入导管中

67
00:04:08.203 --> 00:04:14.088
so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery.
医生可以通过微创手术将它直接植入肿瘤上方

68
00:04:14.423 --> 00:04:18.193
But they are solid enough that once they are positioned
同时这种装置又足够坚固

69
00:04:16.808 --> 00:04:19.653
on top of the tumor,
一旦它们被放置到肿瘤上

70
00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:21.701
they will act as a cage.
它们就像一个笼子

71
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:26.575
They will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs,
通过物理方式阻止肿瘤进入到其它器官

72
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.034
controlling the metastasis.
从而控制癌细胞扩散

73
00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.563
The devices are also biodegradable.
另外，这种装置是可生物降解的

74
00:04:32.587 --> 00:04:34.337
That means that once in the body,
也就是说，一旦进入人体

75
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:36.246
they start dissolving,
它们就开始降解

76
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.633
delivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively
定点地、缓慢地释放药物

77
00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:44.873
than what is done with the current whole-body treatment.
相比于目前的全身治疗方式这种给药方式更加有效

78
00:04:45.164 --> 00:04:47.969
In pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated
临床前研究表明

79
00:04:47.993 --> 00:04:49.992
that this localized approach
这种定位给药方式

80
00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:54.235
is able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment.
可以提升12倍治疗效果

81
00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:57.355
So we took a drug that is already known
我们使用某已知药物

82
00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.210
and by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most,
将它定点放于最需要的部位

83
00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:04.883
we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful,
使得治疗效果增强了12倍

84
00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:07.668
reducing the systemic toxic effect.
并且减少了对身体系统的毒副作用

85
00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:13.053
We are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level.
我们正致力于让这项技术更上一层楼

86
00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:15.924
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing
我们即将完成临床前测试

87
00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:21.658
and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval for clinical trials.
和向食品药品监督管理局申请临床试验前规定的动物实验

88
00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.920
Currently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer.
目前，绝大部分胰腺癌患者都会死于此病

89
00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:29.779
We are hoping that one day,
我们希望，有一天

90
00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:33.074
we can reduce their pain, extend their life
我们可以减轻他们的痛苦，延长他们的生命

91
00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:37.693
and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease.
使胰腺癌成为一种可治愈的疾病

92
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:40.813
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,
反思我们的给药方式

93
00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:44.578
we don't only make it more powerful and less toxic,
我们不仅使其更有效、更小副作用

94
00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:49.387
we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions
我们也为胰腺癌患者和更多其他患者

95
00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.137
for almost all other impossible problems
所面临的各种不可能解决的问题

96
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.424
in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.
打开了找寻革新解决方案的大门

97
00:05:55.448 --> 00:05:56.609
Thank you very much.
谢谢大家
