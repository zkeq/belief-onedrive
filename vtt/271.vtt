00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.194
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals.
七万年前，我们的先祖不过是各种动物中的一种

2
00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:22.317
The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans
当你想到原人时，最重要的是

3
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:24.293
is that they were unimportant.
他们有多不重要。

4
00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:31.836
Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers.
他们对世界的影响力，和水母、萤火虫、啄木鸟差别不大。

5
00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:36.046
Today, in contrast, we control this planet.
今天，相反地，我们变成地球的霸主。

6
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:38.015
And the question is:
所以问题是：

7
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.161
How did we come from there to here?
我们是怎么走到这一步的？

8
00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:45.138
How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes,
我们是如何从毫不起眼的人猿，

9
00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:48.309
minding their own business in a corner of Africa,
在非洲的角落自生自灭，

10
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.823
into the rulers of planet Earth?
摇身一变成为地球霸主的？

11
00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:57.386
Usually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals
通常我们会在个体差异上，

12
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.891
on the individual level.
检视我们与其它动物的差别，

13
00:00:59.232 --> 00:01:02.226
We want to believe -- I want to believe --
我们想要相信－我想要相信，

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.798
that there is something special about me,
我有些特别的地方

15
00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:08.948
about my body, about my brain,
我的身体，我的大脑，

16
00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:14.255
that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.
让我比狗、猪，或是黑猩猩更高级。

17
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.302
But the truth is that, on the individual level,
但事实是，就个体差异来说，

18
00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:21.357
I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee.
我和黑猩猩尴尬地相似。

19
00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:27.084
And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island,
如果你把我和一头黑猩猩放在孤岛上，

20
00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:31.356
and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better,
看我们之间谁能生存的更好，

21
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.596
I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself.
我会赌是黑猩猩，而不是我。

22
00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:40.265
And this is not something wrong with me personally.
这不是我个人的错，

23
00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.415
I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone
我想如果有人把你们其中任何人，

24
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.404
with a chimpanzee on some island,
和一头黑猩猩一起放在孤岛上，

25
00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:48.895
the chimpanzee would do much better.
黑猩猩绝对会生存的更好。

26
00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:54.828
The real difference between humans and all other animals
真正让人类与其它动物分别开来的特质

27
00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:57.299
is not on the individual level;
不是个体的，

28
00:01:57.323 --> 00:01:58.925
it's on the collective level.
而是群体的。

29
00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:04.144
Humans control the planet because they are the only animals
人类控制地球是因为我们是唯一

30
00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:09.345
that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers.
可以大规模灵活合作的动物。

31
00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:11.755
Now, there are other animals --
其它动物，

32
00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.950
like the social insects, the bees, the ants --
那些社会性昆虫，蜜蜂、蚂蚁，

33
00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:19.546
that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly.
它们也可以大规模地合作，但没有像我们这么灵活。

34
00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.356
Their cooperation is very rigid.
它们的合作方式是固定的。

35
00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:27.011
There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function.
蜂巢总是用同一种方式运作。

36
00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:30.846
And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger,
就算遇见新的机会或威胁，

37
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.413
the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight.
蜜蜂也无法在一夜之间创造一种社会制度，

38
00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:38.317
They cannot, for example, execute the queen
比如说，它们无法处死蜂后，

39
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.247
and establish a republic of bees,
建立蜜蜂共和国，

40
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:43.373
or a communist dictatorship of worker bees.
工蜂也不能组成共产政权。

41
00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.605
Other animals, like the social mammals --
其它群居的哺乳类动物，

42
00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.503
the wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees --
像是狼、大象、海豚、黑猩猩 －

43
00:02:50.527 --> 00:02:53.273
they can cooperate much more flexibly,
它们的合作更灵活，

44
00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:56.638
but they do so only in small numbers,
但规模有限，

45
00:02:56.662 --> 00:02:59.535
because cooperation among chimpanzees
因为黑猩猩合作的基础是

46
00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:03.607
is based on intimate knowledge, one of the other.
对彼此的亲密的认知。

47
00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:06.399
I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,
要是你我都是黑猩猩，

48
00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:08.226
and I want to cooperate with you.
我想和你合作，

49
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.845
I need to know you personally.

00:03:12.663 --> 00:03:14.076
Are you a nice chimpanzee?
善良的黑猩猩？

52
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.753
Are you an evil chimpanzee?

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:17.221
Are you trustworthy?
你可靠吗？

54
00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:20.298
If I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?
如果我不认识你，我们怎么合作？

55
00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:25.247
The only animal that can combine the two abilities together
唯一拥有这两种特质

56
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:30.567
and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers
能大规模合作，又能保持灵活的，

57
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:32.221
is us, Homo sapiens.
只有我们，智人。

58
00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:36.924
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,
一比一，甚至十比十，

59
00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:39.517
chimpanzees might be better than us.
黑猩猩都比我们优秀。

60
00:03:39.932 --> 00:03:45.111
But, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees,
但，如果数目提高到一千个人和一千头黑猩猩，

61
00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:48.753
the humans will win easily, for the simple reason
人类就能轻易获胜。

62
00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:52.510
that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all.
因为上千头黑猩猩无法一起合作。

63
00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:57.208
And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees
如果你尝试把十万头黑猩猩，

64
00:03:57.232 --> 00:04:00.848
into Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium,
塞进牛津街、温布利体育馆

65
00:04:00.872 --> 00:04:03.404
or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,

66
00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:06.045
you will get chaos, complete chaos.
绝对会陷入一片混乱。

67
00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.928
Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees.
想象塞满十万头黑猩猩的温布利体育馆，

68
00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:11.626
Complete madness.
那个景象将有多疯狂。

69
00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:17.981
In contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands,
相對的，就算成千上万的人在会场里

70
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.069
and what we get is not chaos, usually.
通常也不会陷入混乱。

71
00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:27.180
What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation.
我们有效率、有制度地合作。

72
00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:32.964
All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history,
人类在历史上达成的巨大成就，

73
00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:36.271
whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon,
无论是金字塔还是上月球，

74
00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:38.870
have been based not on individual abilities,
都不是建立在个体的能力，

75
00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:42.719
but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
而是群体的灵活合作。

76
00:04:43.285 --> 00:04:46.942
Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now:
想想我这场演讲，

77
00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:52.950
I'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people,
我在三四百个人面前演讲

78
00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:56.098
most of you are complete strangers to me.
你们中的大多数我都不认识

79
00:04:56.748 --> 00:05:01.732
Similarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized

80
00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:03.383
and worked on this event.
或参与这个活动的人。

81
00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:10.542
I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here, yesterday, to London.
我不认识昨天带我飞抵伦敦的驾驶员和机组人员。

82
00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:14.829
I don't know the people who invented and manufactured
我不认识是谁发明和制造

83
00:05:14.853 --> 00:05:19.363
this microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying.
这些正在拍摄我的演讲的录像机和麦克风

84
00:05:19.943 --> 00:05:23.480
I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles
为了准备这段演讲，我读了不少书和论文，

85
00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:25.897
that I read in preparation for this talk.
我却不认识它们的作者。

86
00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:29.125
And I certainly don't know all the people
我更不知道

87
00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:32.368
who might be watching this talk over the Internet,
那些正在网上观看这个演讲的人

88
00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:35.419
somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.
他们可能在布宜诺斯艾利斯或是在新德里

89
00:05:35.982 --> 00:05:39.491
Nevertheless, even though we don't know each other,
而且，尽管我们不认识彼此，

90
00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:45.368
we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas.
却能在世界的舞台上，一同参与、创造、交换意见，

91
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.952
This is something chimpanzees cannot do.
这是黑猩猩所做不到的。

92
00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:50.790
They communicate, of course,
当然，它们也能沟通，

93
00:05:50.814 --> 00:05:56.613
but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band
但你不会看到一只黑猩猩远渡重洋，

94
00:05:56.637 --> 00:06:00.757
to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants,

95
00:06:00.781 --> 00:06:03.789
or anything else that might interest chimpanzees.
或任何黑猩猩有兴趣的事。

96
00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:08.699
Now cooperation is, of course, not always nice;
合作自然不是只有好事。

97
00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:12.748
all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history --
人类历史上所有恐怖的事件 －

98
00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.511
and we have been doing some very horrible things --
我们的确做过一些非常恐怖的事 －

99
00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:20.684
all those things are also based on large-scale cooperation.
它们同样也是人类大规模合作达成的。

100
00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:23.304
Prisons are a system of cooperation;
监狱是一种合作系统，

101
00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:26.318
slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation;
屠宰场是一种合作系统，

102
00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:29.346
concentration camps are a system of cooperation.
集中营是一种合作系统。

103
00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:34.907
Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps.
黑猩猩没有屠宰场、监狱、或集中营。

104
00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:39.833
Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes,
现在或许我已经说服你，

105
00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:44.915
we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
因为我们大规模灵活合作的能力，我们掌控了世界。

106
00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:48.284
The next question that immediately arises
下一个问题随之而来。

107
00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:51.191
in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:
好奇的听众心里想：

108
00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:53.499
How, exactly, do we do it?
我们是怎么做到的？

109
00:06:53.903 --> 00:06:59.685
What enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way?
在所有动物中，为什么只有我们这样合作？

110
00:07:01.534 --> 00:07:04.080
The answer is our imagination.
答案是我们的想象力。

111
00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:10.250
We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers,
我们之所以可以和无数陌生人一同合作，

112
00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:13.970
because we alone, of all the animals on the planet,
因为在这星球上的所有动物中

113
00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:18.617
can create and believe fictions, fictional stories.
只有我们能创造和相信虚构的故事，

114
00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:23.734
And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction,
只要大家一同相信同一个故事，

115
00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:27.300
everybody obeys and follows the same rules,

116
00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:29.613
the same norms, the same values.

117
00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:34.358
All other animals use their communication system
其它动物的沟通，

118
00:07:34.382 --> 00:07:36.878
only to describe reality.
只限于描述真实的物事。

119
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.627
A chimpanzee may say, "Look! There's a lion, let's run away!"
黑猩猩说：“看啊！有狮子！快跑！”

120
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:45.757
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!"
或是：“看啊！那有香蕉树！去摘香蕉吧！”

121
00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:52.058
Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality,
而人类呢，我们的语言不只是用来描述现实，

122
00:07:52.082 --> 00:07:56.606
but also to create new realities, fictional realities.
更能用来创造新的现实，想象的现实。

123
00:07:57.098 --> 00:08:01.052
A human can say, "Look, there is a god above the clouds!
人可以说：“看啊！云上有神！

124
00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:03.156
And if you don't do what I tell you to do,
如果你不听从命令，

125
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.385
when you die, God will punish you and send you to hell."
神会在你死后惩罚你直达地狱。”

126
00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:10.578
And if you all believe this story that I've invented,
如果你相信我发明的故事，

127
00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:14.417
then you will follow the same norms and laws and values,
你就会依循一样的基准、法则、价值观，

128
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:15.733
and you can cooperate.
你就会合作。

129
00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:18.448
This is something only humans can do.
这件事只有人类做得到。

130
00:08:19.027 --> 00:08:22.868
You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana
你永远无法说服一只黑猩猩交出香蕉，

131
00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:26.685
by promising him, "... after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."
就算你承諾它：“死後，你可以到黑猩猩天堂......“

132
00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:27.732
(Laughter)
（笑声）

133
00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:31.018
"... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds.
“到时候你的善行，会为你赢得无数的香蕉。

134
00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:32.464
So now give me this banana."
现在，快把香蕉给我。”

135
00:08:32.488 --> 00:08:35.246
No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story.
没有一只黑猩猩会相信这种故事。

136
00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:38.286
Only humans believe such stories,
只有人类会相信这种故事。

137
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:45.262
which is why we control the world, whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
这就是黑猩猩关在动物园或实验室，我们却称霸世界的原因。

138
00:08:46.724 --> 00:08:49.664
Now you may find it acceptable that yes,
或许你现在可以接受，

139
00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:55.828
in the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions.
在宗教领域，拥有相同信念的人一同合作。

140
00:08:55.852 --> 00:09:00.804
Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque
百万人同心合力建造教堂、清真寺

141
00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:03.330
or fight in a crusade or a jihad, 
一同参加圣战

142
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:09.307
because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell.
因为他们信仰神、天堂和地狱。

143
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:15.038
But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism

144
00:09:15.062 --> 00:09:20.926
underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation,

145
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.470
not only in the religious field.

146
00:09:23.494 --> 00:09:25.772
Take, for example, the legal field.

147
00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:32.328
Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights.

148
00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:34.844
But what are human rights?
但人权是什么？

149
00:09:35.416 --> 00:09:40.118
Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented.
人权，就像神和天堂，都是我们发明的故事。

150
00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:42.460
They are not an objective reality;

151
00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:46.150
they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens.

152
00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:50.338
Take a human being, cut him open, look inside,

153
00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:55.489
you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA,

154
00:09:55.513 --> 00:09:57.401
but you won't find any rights.
但你找不到什么权利。

155
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.941
The only place you find rights are in the stories
权利只存在故事里，

156
00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:06.098
that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries.
我们在这几个世纪里创造、散播的故事。

157
00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:11.357
They may be very positive stories, very good stories,

158
00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:14.944
but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented.

159
00:10:15.484 --> 00:10:18.004
The same is true of the political field.
政治领域也一样。

160
00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:24.755
The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations.

00:10:27.413 --> 00:10:29.538
They are not an objective reality.

A mountain is an objective reality.
山陵是客观事实，

164
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.583
You can see it, you can touch it, you can even smell it.
你看得到，摸得到，甚至闻得到。

165
00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:37.815
But a nation or a state,

166
00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:41.619
like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,
以色列、伊朗、法国或德国，

167
00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:44.383
this is just a story that we've invented

168
00:10:44.407 --> 00:10:46.381
and became extremely attached to.

169
00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:49.273
The same is true of the economic field.
经济领域也一样。

170
00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:55.704
The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations.
公司和企业是今日全球金融中不可或缺的元素。

171
00:10:56.227 --> 00:10:59.958
Many of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation,
你们当中的许多人为企业工作，

172
00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:03.032
like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.
像谷歌或丰田或麦当劳。

173
00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:05.215
What exactly are these things?
它们是什么？

174
00:11:05.802 --> 00:11:09.749
They are what lawyers call legal fictions.
律师叫它们法人。

175
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:13.655
They are stories invented and maintained
需要有巫师创造和维持，

176
00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:17.012
by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.
不过我们通常叫这些巫师叫律师。

177
00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:18.481

（笑声）

178
00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:21.924
And what do corporations do all day?

00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:26.564
Yet, what is money?
但钱是什么？

00:11:26.588 --> 00:11:31.754
Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value.

182
00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:35.095
Take this green piece of paper, the dollar bill.

183
00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:37.496
Look at it -- it has no value.

184
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.754
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,
你不能吃它，不能喝它，

185
00:11:39.778 --> 00:11:41.070
you cannot wear it.
不能把它穿在身上。

186
00:11:41.453 --> 00:11:45.494
But then came along these master storytellers --

187
00:11:45.518 --> 00:11:47.002

and they tell us a very convincing story:

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.328
"Look, you see this green piece of paper?

It is actually worth 10 bananas."

197
00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:07.546
go to the supermarket,

198
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.577
give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before,

199
00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:16.286
and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat.

200
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.411
This is something amazing.

201
00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:20.513
You could never do it with chimpanzees.
黑猩猩可办不到。

202
00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:22.482
Chimpanzees trade, of course:

203
00:12:22.506 --> 00:12:25.256
"Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana."

That can work.

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:29.534
But, you give me a worthless piece of paper

207

ever invented and told by humans,

To conclude, then:

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:23.478
We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality.

All other animals live in an objective reality.

this fictional reality became more and more powerful

depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities,

YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,
哈拉利：好的。在工业革命时期，

256
00:15:26.438 --> 00:15:31.340
we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat.

As computers become better and better in more and more fields,

there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us

in most tasks and will make humans redundant.

264
00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:04.881

265
00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:07.067
"What do we need humans for?",

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:10.458

BG: Do you have an answer in the book?

(Laughter)
（笑声）

270
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:23.125
but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future.

271
00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.958
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now,

that for all the discussion about the growing evidence

00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:35.571
YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;
哈拉利：这不是预言；

275

it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us.
只是评估眼前的所有可能性。

276
00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:44.544
One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people.

277
00:16:44.568 --> 00:16:47.708
Another possibility is the division of humankind

with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods,
