21
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.538
They have the Napoleon complex of demographics,

As a social justice comedian,

it's my goal to convert these haters,

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.800
I'm probably missing 3-7 items.
我也许落下了3到7个

29
00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.046
But the point is,
但我要说的是

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.799
we have to reckon with the haters.
这些怀恨者不可小觑

31
00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:19.634
But there's variance within this group

32
00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:22.679
and it's not efficient to go after all of them, right?
调查他们所有人也太没效率了，对吧？

33
00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:26.216
So what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.
于是，我创造了一个 非常科学的怀恨者分类法

34
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.963
I basically took all of the haters,

35
00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.833
I put them in a petri dish, like a scientist,

There's also the drive-by haters.

Now, these people will be at a stoplight,

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.238
they'll wait for the light to turn green

and hated you to your face.

But they just don't make them like they used to --

49
00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:02.352
which is another sign of the decline in America.

50
00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:03.550
(Laughter)
（笑声）

55
00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.382
like a church or a nonprofit,

57
00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:22.684
But the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater.

(Laughter)
（笑声）

73
00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:55.316

Why does social justice comedy work?

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:12.033
a rectal exam.

Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy:

89
00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.135

Here's how I see social justice comedy working.

97
00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.557
And we went around the country
我们在美国转了一圈

98
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.518
to places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia --
去了阿拉巴马，亚利桑那， 田纳西，乔治亚 —

99
00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:55.741
places where they love the Muzzies --
一些他们爱的死去活来的地方 —

100
00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.453
and we did stand-up shows.

101
00:03:58.477 --> 00:04:00.791
We called the tour "The Muslims Are Coming!"

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:04.810
We turned this into a movie,
我们把这次旅行拍成了电影，

104
00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.058
and then after the movie came out,

107
00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:15.525
with the MTA -- that's the New York City subway system.

108
00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.395
Now, the posters were truly offensive,
当时那些海报可真是冒犯了不少人，

109
00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.180
not to mentioned poorly designed --
更别提它糟糕的设计了－

110
00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.038
I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,
我是说，如果你想表现得有偏见，

111
00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:22.814
you might as well use a better font.
你也得挑个好看点的字体吧！

112
00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:23.839
(Laughter)
（笑声）

113
00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.815
But we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign

决定发起一个 “非常欢快得 打击偏执狂” 宣传海报。

119
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:41.762
got the posters approved,

120
00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:44.665
and two days after they were supposed to go up,
本来要把海报张 贴出来的，但是两天后，

121
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.836

00:05:10.757 --> 00:05:13.345
they have great frittata recipes.
他们有极佳的煎蛋饼食谱。

135
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.876
Now clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA.
很显然，煎蛋饼被MTA认作为了政治因素。

136
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.357
Either that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light
要不是蛋饼，要不就是 仅仅提到了穆斯林的好处，

137
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:23.405
was considered political -- but it isn't.

139
00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:25.865

143
00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:36.647
So basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians
所以，基本上，我想说的就是 几个在行业内混不下去的喜剧演员

144
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:39.202
took on a major New York City agency

Victory was a very weird feeling.

Here's another example.

153
00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.048
I'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"
无论我走到哪儿，都会被问： “为什么穆斯林不谴责恐怖主义？”

154
00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:01.263
We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.
我们是谴责的。但是， 既然如此，我决定将错就错。

155
00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:03.933
So I decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com.
所以我就决定发起一个网站 thedailydenouncer.com（每日谴责人）

Let's take a look at an example.

They generally appear as single-panel cartoons,

160
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.668
"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people who never fill the paper tray!"
“我要谴责恐怖主义！同时我也谴责 那些从来不把纸盘子装满的人！”

161
00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:20.507
The point of the website is that it denounces terrorism
这个网站的目的性，就是

162
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:22.667
while recognizing that it's ridiculous
让我们在反复谴责 恐怖主义的过程中

163
00:06:22.691 --> 00:06:25.452
that we have to constantly denounce terrorism.

164
00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:27.727
But if bigotry isn't your thing,

social justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues.

166

For example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp

went to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking.

but at the end of every month,

(Laughter)

The bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security.
银行经理大概会忍我们30-45秒， 然后就要喊安保人员了。

178

because -- and this is the last rule of social justice comedy --

sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants.
