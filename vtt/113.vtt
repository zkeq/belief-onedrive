00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:40.284
and that selects for resistant mutants.
[AI] 这就选择了抗性突变体。

263
00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:43.057
And so now. of course. we have this global problem
[AI] 现在也是如此。当然我们有这个全球性的问题

264
00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:44.739
in infectious diseases.
[AI] 在传染病方面。

265
00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:48.135
So we thought. what if we could sort of do behavior modifications.
[AI] 所以我们想。如果我们可以做一些行为改变呢。

266
00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:51.547
just make these bacteria so they can't talk. they can't count.
[AI] 让这些细菌不能说话。他们不会数数。

267
00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.972
and they don't know to launch virulence?
[AI] 他们不知道如何发射毒力？

268
00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:57.609
So that's exactly what we've done. and we've sort of taken two strategies.
[AI] 这正是我们所做的。我们采取了两种策略。

269
00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:01.822
The first one is. we've targeted the intraspecies communication system.
[AI] 第一个是。我们瞄准了种内通讯系统。

270
00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:06.071
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules. which you saw.
[AI] 所以我们制造了看起来有点像真实分子的分子。你看到了。

271
00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:07.805
but they're a little bit different.
[AI] 但是他们有点不同。

272
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.684
And so they lock into those receptors.
[AI] 因此它们锁定了这些受体。

273
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:12.454
and they jam recognition of the real thing.
[AI] 它们阻碍了对真实事物的识别。

274
00:13:12.478 --> 00:13:14.407
So by targeting the red system.
[AI] 因此，以红色系统为目标。

275
00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:19.377
what we are able to do is make species-specific. or disease-specific.
[AI] 我们所能做的就是使物种具有特异性。或疾病特异性。

276
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:21.236
anti-quorum-sensing molecules.
[AI] 反群体感应分子。

277
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.849
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.
[AI] 我们对粉色系统也做了同样的事情。

278
00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:27.303
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit
[AI] 我们把这个宇宙分子扭转了一点

279
00:13:27.327 --> 00:13:31.546
so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system.
[AI] 所以我们制造了种间通讯系统的对手。

280
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.797
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics
[AI] 希望这些药物能被用作广谱抗生素

281
00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:37.787
that work against all bacteria.
[AI] 对所有细菌都有效。

282
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:40.571
And so to finish. I'll show you the strategy.
[AI] 就这样结束了。我会告诉你策略。

283
00:13:40.595 --> 00:13:43.257
In this one. I'm just using the interspecies molecule.
[AI] 在这一个。我只是用了种间分子。

284
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.400
but the logic is exactly the same.
[AI] 但逻辑是完全相同的。

285
00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:48.677
So what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal --
[AI] 所以你知道的是当细菌进入动物体内--

286
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:49.870
in this case. a mouse --
[AI] 在这种情况下。老鼠--

287
00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:52.289
it doesn't initiate virulence right away.
[AI] 它不会马上产生毒力。

288
00:13:52.313 --> 00:13:54.028
It gets in. it starts growing.
[AI] 它进来了。它开始生长。

289
00:13:54.052 --> 00:13:56.898
it starts secreting its quorum-sensing molecules.
[AI] 它开始分泌其群体感应分子。

290
00:13:56.922 --> 00:13:59.296
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria
[AI] 当它有足够的细菌时，它就能识别

291
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.484
that now they're going to launch their attack.
[AI] 现在他们要发动进攻了。

292
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.811
and the animal dies.
[AI] 动物死了。

293
00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:06.378
And so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections.
[AI] 所以我们所能做的就是给这些致命的感染。

294
00:14:06.402 --> 00:14:10.245
but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum-sensing molecules.
[AI] 但是我们把它们和我们的反群体感应分子结合起来。

295
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:13.127
So these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing.
[AI] 这些分子看起来有点像真的。

296
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:16.264
but they're a little different. which I've depicted on this slide.
[AI] 但是他们有点不同。我在这张幻灯片上描述过。

297
00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:20.013
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium --
[AI] 我们现在知道的是，如果我们用致病细菌治疗动物--

298
00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:22.314
a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --
[AI] 一株多药耐药的病原菌--

299
00:14:22.338 --> 00:14:26.362
in the same time we give our anti-quorum-sensing molecule.
[AI] 同时，我们给出了我们的反群体感应分子。

300
00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:28.265
in fact. the animal lives.
[AI] 事实上动物活着。

301
00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:31.517
And so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics.
[AI] 所以我们认为这是下一代抗生素。

302
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.030
and it's going to get us around. at least initially.

303
00:14:34.054 --> 00:14:36.228
this big problem of resistance.

307
00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:47.526
that we're just now starting to learn about.

308
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:52.378
Of course. what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular.

309
00:14:52.402 --> 00:14:54.207
So in the spirit of TED.

310
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.107
they're doing things together because it makes a difference.
