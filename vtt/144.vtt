00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.059
Do you remember a time when you felt hormonal and moody?
你是否记得某个时刻曾经感到 心情烦躁和郁郁寡欢？

2
00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.067
Your skin was breaking out,
你的皮肤上正冒出小痘痘，

3
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:23.193
your body was growing in strange places and very fast,
身体的特殊部位 开始发育并快速生长，

4
00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:25.212
and at the same time,
与此同时，

5
00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:28.195
people were expecting you to be grown-up in this new way.
大人们也正期待你以这种新的方式长大。

6
00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:30.227
Teenagers, right?
说的是青少年，对吧？

7
00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.975
Well, these same changes happen to a woman when she's having a baby.
其实，女人怀孕时 也会发生同样的变化。

8
00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.353
And we know that it's normal for teenagers to feel all over the place,
我们知道，青少年感到 困惑和敏感很正常，

9
00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:43.732
so why don't we talk about pregnancy in the same way?
我们何不以同样的方式谈论怀孕呢？

10
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.323
There are entire textbooks written about the developmental arc of adolescence,
市面上有成套的关于 青春期发展曲线的教科书，

11
00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:54.558
and we don't even have a word to describe the transition to motherhood.
而我们甚至没有一个描述 由女人变为母亲的术语。

12
00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:56.256
We need one.
我们需要一个这样的词汇。

13
00:00:57.092 --> 00:01:00.322
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women,
我是一名与孕妇和产妇 打交道的精神科医生，

14
00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:02.002
a reproductive psychiatrist,
即生殖心理医生。

15
00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:04.944
and in the decade that I've been working in this field,
在这个领域工作的十年里，

16
00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:06.688
I've noticed a pattern.
我注意到了一个模式。

17
00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.668
It goes something like this:
一般是这样的：

18
00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:10.150
a woman calls me up,
一位女士打来电话，

19
00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.855
she's just had a baby,
她刚生了孩子，

20
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.317
and she's concerned.
而且感到很忧虑。

21
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:17.776
She says, "I'm not good at this. I'm not enjoying this.
她说，"我不擅养育孩子，也不喜欢。

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.006
Do I have postpartum depression?"
我得了产后抑郁症吗？”

23
00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:22.800
So I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis,
接下来，我仔细分析了诊断的症状，

24
00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:25.813
and it's clear to me that she's not clinically depressed,
很显然她没得临床抑郁症，

25
00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:27.317
and I tell her that.
我告诉了她诊断结果。

26
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:29.234
But she isn't reassured.
但她依然不放心，

27
00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:32.413
"It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists.
"我不该有这样的感觉，" 她坚称。

28
00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:35.729
So I say, "OK. What did you expect it to feel like?"
因此我说道 "好吧，那你 认为应该是怎样的感觉呢？”

29
00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:40.972
She says, "I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.
她说，"我曾以为，当了母亲 会让我感到完整和快乐；

30
00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:44.955
I thought my instincts would naturally tell me what to do.
本能自然而然就会 告诉我应该怎么做；

31
00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:48.354
I thought I'd always want to put the baby first."
我曾经也以为，自己会总想着 把孩子放在首位。”

32
00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:53.404
This -- this is an unrealistic expectation
这种感觉——这是对 从女人转变成母亲的

33
00:01:53.428 --> 00:01:55.939
of what the transition to motherhood feels like.
不切实际的期望。

34
00:01:56.456 --> 00:01:58.504
And it wasn't just her.
无独有偶，

35
00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:03.483
I was getting calls with questions like this from hundreds of women,
我接到过几百位有类似 问题的女士打来的电话，

36
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.157
all concerned that something was wrong,
她们都不约而同地 担心自己出了问题，

37
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:08.213
because they couldn't measure up.
因为她们无法达到自己的期望值。

38
00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:11.111
And I didn't know how to help them,
我不知道如何帮助她们，

39
00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.745
because telling them that they weren't sick
因为告诉了她们没病的事实，

40
00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.605
wasn't making them feel better.
并没让她们感觉轻松一些。

41
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:20.942
I wanted to find a way to normalize this transition,
我想找到一种让这种转变 更加正常化的方法，

42
00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:26.368
to explain that discomfort is not always the same thing as disease.
能解释这种心理不适 与疾病其实是两码事。

43
00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:30.450
So I set out to learn more about the psychology of motherhood.
所以，我开始学习更多 关于母性心理的知识，

44
00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:33.348
But there actually wasn't much in the medical textbooks,
但医学课本对此却鲜有提及，

45
00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:35.989
because doctors mostly write about disease.
因为医生们大部分写的 是关于疾病的知识。

46
00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:38.377
So I turned to anthropology.
于是，我转向人类学寻找答案。

47
00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:42.414
And it took me two years, but in an out-of-print essay
花了两年的时间，

48
00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:46.408
written in 1973 by Dana Raphael,
在一篇 丹娜 · 拉斐尔 写于 1973 年的绝版文章中，

49
00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:50.935
I finally found a helpful way to frame this conversation:
我终于找到了一个有效的 方式来概括这段对话：

50
00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.401
matrescence.
孕乳期。

51
00:02:53.492 --> 00:02:58.304
It's not a coincidence that "matrescence" sounds like "adolescence."
"孕乳期" 听起来 很像 "青春期"，但这并非巧合，

52
00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:02.686
Both are times when body morphing and hormone shifting
两种情况都是由于身体改变 和激素变化同时作用所致，

53
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.414
lead to an upheaval in how a person feels emotionally
这两种因素造成人在情绪感受

54
00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:08.687
and how they fit into the world.
及如何融入生活方面发生剧变。

55
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.870
And like adolescence, matrescence is not a disease,
和青春期一样，孕乳期不是病，

56
00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:15.716
but since it's not in the medical vocabulary,
但因为这一改变 并不存在于医学词汇中，

57
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.427
since doctors aren't educating people about it,
医生也没教给人们这方面的知识，

58
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:21.240
it's being confused with a more serious condition
所以，人们将孕乳期现象

59
00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:23.030
called postpartum depression.
和更严重的产后抑郁症混为一谈。

60
00:03:24.264 --> 00:03:26.752
I've been building on the anthropology literature
我一直在人类学文献的基础上，

61
00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:29.916
and have been talking about matrescence with my patients
使用 "推和拉" 的概念，

62
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.530
using a concept called the "push and pull."
和病人谈关于孕乳期的问题。

63
00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:34.317
Here's the pull part.
“拉”的部分是这样的：

64
00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:39.208
As humans, our babies are uniquely dependent.
我们人类的婴儿特别依赖他人。

65
00:03:39.232 --> 00:03:42.175
Unlike other animals, our babies can't walk,
和其它动物不同的是， 我们的婴儿不会走路、

66
00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.786
they can't feed themselves,
不能自己吃饭，

67
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.693
they're very hard to take care of.
照顾它们特别费心。

68
00:03:45.717 --> 00:03:50.590
So evolution has helped us out with this hormone called oxytocin.
所以进化用了一种叫做催产素的激素 来帮助我们解决这个难题。

69
00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:52.915
It's released around childbirth
分娩时身体会释放催产素，

70
00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.415
and also during skin-to-skin touch,
（与婴儿）皮肤接触时 也会释放催产素，

71
00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.710
so it rises even if you didn't give birth to the baby.
所以即便你没在生孩子， 身体也会分泌催产素。

72
00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:04.957
Oxytocin helps a human mother's brain zoom in, pulling her attention in,
催产素帮助人类母亲的大脑集中 精力、 把她的注意力“拉”过来，

73
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.817
so that the baby is now at the center of her world.
让宝宝成为她当下世界的中心。

74
00:04:08.387 --> 00:04:13.769
But at the same time, her mind is pushing away,
但与此同时, 理智 把她从宝宝身上“推”开，

75
00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:18.429
because she remembers there are all these other parts to her identity --
因为她想起来自己的 身份还包含了其他内容——

76
00:04:19.254 --> 00:04:20.809
other relationships,
其他各种关系、

77
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.655
her work,
她的工作、

78
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.931
hobbies,

79
00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:26.482
a spiritual and intellectual life,
精神和知性生活，

80
00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:28.774
not to mention physical needs:
更不用说生理需要了：

81
00:04:28.798 --> 00:04:32.161
to sleep, to eat, to exercise,
要睡觉、 吃饭、 运动、

82
00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:33.657
to have sex,
过性生活、

83
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:35.095
to go to the bathroom,
去洗手间，

84
00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:36.287
alone --
一个人去做以上这些事情——

85
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:37.480
(Laughter)
（笑声）

86
00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:38.674
if possible.
如果可能的话。

87
00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:43.581
This is the emotional tug-of-war of matrescence.
这就是孕乳期的情感纠葛，

88
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.385
This is the tension the women calling me were feeling.
这就是给我打电话的 女士们所感受到的不安，

89
00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.689
It's why they thought they were sick.
这就是为什么她们认为自己病了。

90
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.781
If women understood the natural progression of matrescence,
如果女性已经知晓了 孕乳期的自然发展过程，

91
00:04:55.805 --> 00:05:01.448
if they knew that most people found it hard to live inside this push and pull,
如果她们已明白大多数人很难 在这种“推和拉”的矛盾中生活，

92
00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:04.397
if they knew that under these circumstances,
如果她们已然知晓： 在这种情形之下，

93
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.971
ambivalence was normal and nothing to be ashamed of,
矛盾心理是正常的， 没有什么可羞愧的，

94
00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:11.025
they would feel less alone,
她们就不会那么孤单无助，

95
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.352
they would feel less stigmatized,
也就会少一些自责，

96
00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:17.501
and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression.
我认为做到这一点甚至会 降低产后抑郁症的发病率。

97
00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:20.096
I'd love to study that one day.
我很乐意有一天能研究这个课题。

98
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:23.119
I'm a believer in talk therapy,
我信奉谈话疗法，

99
00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:25.972
so if we're going to change the way our culture understands
所以，如果我们要改变我们的文化

100
00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:27.790
this transition to motherhood,

101

women need to be talking to each other,

102
00:05:30.002 --> 00:05:31.324
not just me.
而不仅仅是与我交流。

103
00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:35.762
So mothers, talk about your matrescence
所以妈妈们，跟其他母亲 谈论你的孕乳期感受吧，

104
00:05:35.786 --> 00:05:38.433
with other mothers, with your friends,
也可以和朋友交流，

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.597
so that they can understand their own transition

and better support you.

108
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.762
But it's not just about protecting your relationship.
但这不仅仅是为了 保护你和周围人的关系，

109
00:05:49.354 --> 00:05:52.799
When you preserve a separate part of your identity,

you're also leaving room for your child to develop their own.

each unsteady in their own way.
