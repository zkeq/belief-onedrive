146
00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:18.301
Well. some languages don't do this.
[AI] 好有些语言不这样做。

147
00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:21.474
because some languages don't have exact number words.
[AI] 因为有些语言没有精确的数字单词。

148
00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:24.756
They're languages that don't have a word like "seven"

151
00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:32.532
and they have trouble keeping track of exact quantities.

153
00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.773
to the same number of ducks.
