00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.145
If we evolved from monkeys. why are there still monkeys?
[AI] 如果我们是从猴子进化而来的。为什么还有猴子？

2
00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.548
(Laughter)
[AI] （众笑）

3
00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:20.660

6
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.869
Now. knowing you're a fish and not a monkey

7
00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:30.320
is actually really important to understanding where we came from.
[AI] 这对了解我们的来历非常重要。

8
00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:34.081
I teach one of the largest evolutionary biology classes in the US.

9
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:38.164
and when my students finally understand why I call them fish all the time.

10
00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:40.365
then I know I'm getting my job done.
[AI] 那我就知道我正在完成我的工作。

11
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:45.433
But I always have to start my classes by dispelling some hardwired myths.
[AI] 但我总是要在开始上课时消除一些根深蒂固的误解。

12
00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:49.504
because without really knowing it. many of us were taught evolution wrong.
[AI] 因为我不知道。我们中的许多人被教导进化论是错误的。

13
00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:54.097
For instance. we're taught to say "the theory of evolution."
[AI] 例如。我们被教导说“进化论”

14
00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:58.581
There are actually many theories. and just like the process itself.

22
00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:25.605
Evolution is a fact as much as the "theory of gravity."

31
00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.813

32
00:01:50.837 --> 00:01:54.256
We learn plants and bacteria are primitive things.

47
00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:40.268
but you can't ask that age-old question.
