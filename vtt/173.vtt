00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.620
A few years ago, I broke into my own house.
几年前，我闯入了自己的家。

2
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.916
I had just driven home,
我开车回到家，

3
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.476
it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,
在蒙特利尔的寒冬， 大约午夜时分，

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.796
I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,
我开车从城镇一边到另一边， 去看望我的朋友Jeff,

5
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.596
and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees --
门廊上的温度计显示零下40度——

6
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.716
and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
不需要知道是摄氏度还是华氏度,

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.196
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --
到了零下40度， 两个温度显示都一样——

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.476
it was very cold.
天气非常冷。

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.716
And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,
当我站在门廊，摸索着我的口袋，

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.996
I found I didn't have my keys.
发现找不到钥匙。

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.116
In fact, I could see them through the window,
实际上，我透过窗户能看到我的钥匙，

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.236
lying on the dining room table where I had left them.
我把它们留在了餐桌上。

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.396
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,
我赶紧围着房子转， 找能进去的门和窗户，

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.996
and they were locked tight.
而它们都被锁紧了。

15
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.163
I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone,
我想到打电话给锁匠， 至少我还有手机，

16
00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:56.516
but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,
但在午夜， 锁匠要过来可能需要一段时间，

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.700
and it was cold.
并且天气真的很冷。

18
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:02.956
I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night
当晚我又不能回朋友Jeff的家，

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.647
because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,
因为第二天我要坐早班机到欧洲，

20
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:07.910
and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
必须要进屋里拿护照和行李。

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.716
So, desperate and freezing cold,
因此，在绝望和寒冷中，

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.356
I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,
我找到一块大石头， 打破了地下室的窗户，

23
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.356
cleared out the shards of glass,
清理了玻璃碎片后，

24
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.716
I crawled through,
我爬进屋里，

25
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.156
I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,
找到了一块硬纸板，用胶带 把它封贴在打破的窗户上，

26
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.800
figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,
我想着早晨去机场的路上，

27
00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:26.596
I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.
可以打电话给承包商， 请他来修理窗户。

28
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.097
This was going to be expensive,
修理费会很昂贵，

29
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.676
but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
但不会比在午夜时 找锁匠来开锁更贵，

30
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.860
so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
所以我觉得，在这种情况下 即使打破了窗户，也还划得来。

31
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.916
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training
我是一个职业的神经科学家，

32
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.036
and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.
我大概知道在压力下 大脑是如何工作的。

33
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.596
It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,
大脑会释放皮质醇引起你的心率加速，

34
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.876
it modulates adrenaline levels
它调节你的肾上腺素水平

35
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.380
and it clouds your thinking.
并阻碍你的思维能力。

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.876
So the next morning,
第二天早晨，

37
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.356
when I woke up on too little sleep,
我醒来的时候严重睡眠不足，

worrying about the hole in the window,

40
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.636
and the freezing temperatures,
还有，天气非常寒冷，

41
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.116
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
在欧洲有个会要开，

42
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.676
and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,
还有，因为我大脑释放的皮质醇，

43
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.076
my thinking was cloudy,
我的思维变得混沌，

44
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.516
but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.
但我没觉察到它很混沌， 因为我的思维很混沌。

45
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.036
(Laughter)
（笑声）

46
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.316
And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,
直到我在登机手续办理柜台时，

47
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.596
that I realized I didn't have my passport.
才意识到我忘了带护照。

48
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.636
(Laughter)
（笑声）

49
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.116
So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,
于是，我在冰天雪地中 用了40分钟赶回家，

50
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.596
got my passport, raced back to the airport,
拿了护照后，又赶回机场，

51
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.436
I made it just in time,
刚好赶上了飞机，

52
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.699
but they had given away my seat to someone else,
但他们已把我的座位给了别人，

53
00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:35.699
so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,
我不得不坐在飞机最后一排， 紧挨着洗手间，

54
00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:38.940
in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.
在八个小时的飞行中， 我的座椅都不能往后倾。

55
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.156
Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
于是我就有了很多时间去思考， 因为我在八小时中无法睡觉。

56
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.316
(Laughter)
（笑声）

57
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.996
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do,
我开始想，我能做些什么，

58
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.976
systems that I can put into place,

59
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.436
that will prevent bad things from happening?

60
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.356
Or at least if bad things happen,
或者至少， 就算不好的事情真的会发生，

61
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.380
will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.
也能把损失降到最小。

62
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.756
So I started thinking about that,
所以，我开始思考这个问题，

63
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.638
but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.
但我没有想出来， 直到一个月后，

64
00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:07.356
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
我和同事，也是诺贝尔奖获得者 Danny Kahneman去吃晚餐，

65
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.756
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,
我有点尴尬地告诉他， 我打破窗户爬进屋里，

66
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.196
and, you know, forgotten my passport,

67
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.436
and Danny shared with me
而Danny和我分享了

68
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.956
that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
他一直在练习的 称为”预测后见之明“的东西。

69
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.716
(Laughter)
（笑声）

70
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.883
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,
这是他从心理学家Gary Klein 那里学到的。

71
00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:25.956
who had written about it a few years before,
Gary 前几年已经写了这个理论，

72
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.076
also called the pre-mortem.
也称为"事前剖析"。

73
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.053
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.
你们都知道事后剖析是什么意思。

74
00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.556
Whenever there's a disaster,
每当有灾难，

75
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.876
a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?
一个专家小组就会前去调查， 尝试找出导致灾难的原因，对吧 ？

76
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.316
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
而Danny解释，在事前剖析中，

77
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.236
you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,
你要预测， 尝试想出可能出错的所有事情，

78
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.836
and then you try to figure out what you can do
然后你要尝试可能的方法来

79
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.356
to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
防止这些错误发生， 或将损失降到最小。

80
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.316
So what I want to talk to you about today
所以，今天我想和你们谈谈关于

81
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.876
are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.
在事前剖析中， 我们能做的一些事情。

82
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.796
Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.
有些方式是显而易见的， 而有些则不那么明显。

83
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.756
I'll start with the obvious ones.
我先谈显而易见的方式。

84
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.860
Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.
在家里，指定一个地方， 放容易丢失的东西。

85
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.356
Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is,
这听起来就像是常识，也的确是，

86
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.916
but there's a lot of science to back this up,
但这符合我们空间记忆的工作原理，

87
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.236
based on the way our spatial memory works.
有很多科学依据支持这一点。

88
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.116
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,
在我们大脑里， 有一个叫海马体的结构，

89
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.076
that evolved over tens of thousands of years,
已经进化超过数万年了，

90
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.876
to keep track of the locations of important things --
它可以追踪重要东西的位置——

91
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.316
where the well is, where fish can be found,
例如，水井的位置， 能够发现鱼的地方，

92
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.836
that stand of fruit trees,
果树的位置，

93
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.476
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
以及友好物种和敌对物种 分别居住在哪里。

94
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.405
The hippocampus is the part of the brain
海马体是大脑的一部分，

95
00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:37.916
that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.
伦敦出租车司机的 海马体结构通常比常人要大。

96
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.636
It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
松鼠能找到坚果， 也要归功于它们大脑的海马体。

97
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.518
And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment
你们可能对这点感到疑惑， 但有人的确做了一个实验。

98
00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:47.316
where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
他们切掉了松鼠的嗅觉器官，

99
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.156
and they could still find their nuts.
松鼠仍然能找到它们的坚果。

100
00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:51.970
They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,
它们不是用嗅觉， 而是用大脑的海马体，

101
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.056
this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.
这个进化完美的大脑机制 是用来找东西的。

102
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.796
But it's really good for things that don't move around much,
但只是对找固定的东西比较有效，

103
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.276
not so good for things that move around.
找会移动的东西却不是很管用。

104
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.596
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.
这就是为什么我们会常常找不到 车钥匙，老花镜和护照。

105
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.116
So in the home, designate a spot for your keys --
所以，在家里指定一个 地点存放你的钥匙——

106
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.996
a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.
门上的挂钩，或是一个装饰碗。

107
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.116
For your passport, a particular drawer.
在一个特定的抽屉存放你的护照。

108
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.916
For your reading glasses, a particular table.
你的老花镜要放在特定的桌子上。

109
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.396
If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,
如果你指定了特定的地方， 并且一丝不苟地做这些事，

110
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.236
your things will always be there when you look for them.
当你寻找它们时， 这些东西总是会在那里。

111
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.476
What about travel?
关于旅行呢？

112
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.876
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards,
用手机拍下你信用卡的照片，

113
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.196
your driver's license, your passport,
还有你的驾照和护照，

114
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.476
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
把这些照片发到你的电子邮箱， 储存在数据云端。

115
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.876
If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.
如果一旦丢失或被盗了， 你可以很方便地用电子件代替它们。

116
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.516
Now these are some rather obvious things.
这些是一些显而易见的 事前剖析方法。

117
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.076
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
记住，当你有压力时， 大脑会释放皮质醇。

118
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.316
Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
皮质醇是有毒的， 它会导致思维不清晰。

119
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.876
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem
所以，做事前剖析的练习，

120
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.156
is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,
是要认识到在压力下， 你不是在最佳状态，

121
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.476
and you should put systems in place.
你还应该把事情做到井然有序。

122
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.436
And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation
不过也许没有什么 比你要做医疗决策

123
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.876
than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
更紧张的情况了。

124
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.196
And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,
有时，我们都会经历这种事情，

125
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.596
where we have to make a very important decision
我们必须要做出一个很重要的决策，

126
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.916
about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,
为我们自己或自己爱的人

127
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.596
to help them with a decision.
做医疗决策。

128
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.236
And so I want to talk about that.
所以，我想谈谈这个话题。

129
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.276
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
我要说一个非常特殊的医疗情况。

130
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.836
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,
但它代表了各种决策：医疗决策，

131
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.876
and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making --
当然还有财政决策和社交决策——

132
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.156
any kind of decision you have to make
任何你必须做的决策，

133
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.196
that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
可以让你从理性的事实评估中受益。

134
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.356
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,
假设你去看医生，而医生说，

135
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.500
"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
“我刚拿到你验血结果， 你的胆固醇有点高。”

136
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.076
Now, you all know that high cholesterol
你们都知道，胆固醇高

137
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.236
is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
会增加患心血管疾病，

having high cholesterol isn't the best thing,
高胆固醇不是一件好事，

141
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.030

you probably even know people who take them.

147
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.221

148
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:11.976
But there's a question you should ask at this point,

And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?

158
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.476
The number should be one.
这数字应该是1啊，

159
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.556
My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me

if it's not going to help.

and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?

the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.

debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress --

186
00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:49.478
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,

00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:50.748
not very likely it's going to happen to me,

所以，要提前思考一下你该如何做，

192
00:08:57.826 --> 00:09:01.695
so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.
这样你就不用事到临头时 再去进行一连串的推理了。

I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.

I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,
我为了制造震撼的效果 凭空捏造了这个数字，

但实际上，这个治疗所需人数 是相当具有代表性的。

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.396
removal of the prostate for cancer,

如果你“有幸”成为了50% 受副作用影响的人中的一个，

they'll only last for a year or two.

毕竟你不想事到临头 再来思考所有事情。

And you also want to think about things like quality of life.
而且你也需要考虑一下生活质量。

222
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.116
Because you have a choice oftentimes,

do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,

but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.

Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,

and one of the things that happens at that moment

231
00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:53.726
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
你整个思维系统似乎停工了。

232
00:10:53.726 --> 00:10:55.906
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
这里有一个进化方面的原因。

233
00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:59.085
Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,
和一个捕食者面对面时， 你不需要你的消化系统，

234
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.916
or your libido, or your immune system,

235
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.596
because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things

and you don't react quickly,

237
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.276
you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.

238
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.716
Unfortunately,

one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress

240
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.356
is rational, logical thinking,

as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.

to these kinds of situations.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.356
We all are going to fail now and then.
我们都会不时地经历失败，

246
00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:39.686
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,

00:11:39.686 --> 00:11:43.703
to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,

Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal,

when I got back from my trip,

I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,

and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.

So I'm not completely organized,

but I see organization as a gradual process,

258
