1
00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.294
I want to speak about  a forgotten conflict.
我想讲述一场被遗忘的战争。

2
00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines.
一个几乎从不占据头条的斗争。

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.220
It happens right here, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
它在这里发生，在刚果共和国。

4
00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:28.662
Now, most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo,
现在，大部分不生活在非洲的人并不知晓刚果的战争，

5
00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.919
so let me give you a couple of key facts.
所以让我来告诉你几个重要的事实。

6
00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.507
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest  conflict since World War II.
刚果战争是第二次世界大战以来最致命的战斗。

7
00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:40.807
It has caused almost four million deaths.
它已经导致了将近四百万死亡。

8
00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:45.401
It has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past 18 years.
它已经让过去18年的中非颠沛流离。

9
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:50.321
It is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world.
它是世界上正在进行的最大人道危机。

10
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:53.982
That's why I first went to Congo in 2001.
这就是为什么我在2001去了刚果。

11
00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:59.114
I was a young humanitarian aid worker, and I met this woman who was my age.
当时还是个人道主义救援人员的我，遇到了一个年龄相仿的女孩。

12
00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:01.588
She was called Isabelle.
她叫伊莎贝拉。

13
00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:05.999
Local militias had attacked Isabelle's village.
当地的义勇军袭击了伊莎贝拉的村庄。

14
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:09.047
They had killed many men, raped many women.
他们杀了许多男人，强暴了许多女人。

15
00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:11.044
They had looted everything.
他们洗劫了一切。

16
00:01:11.044 --> 00:01:13.667
And then they wanted to take Isabelle,
后来他们想带走伊莎贝拉，

17
00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.044
but her husband stepped in,
但是她丈夫站了出来，

18
00:01:15.044 --> 00:01:18.242
and he said, "No, please don't take Isabelle.
他说，“不，求你们不要带走她，

19
00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:21.529
Take me instead."
让我代替她吧。”

20
00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:24.520
So he had gone to the forest with the militias,
就这样他跟着民兵进了森林，

21
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.691
and Isabelle had never seen him again.
伊莎贝拉再也没有见过他。

22
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:32.661
Well, it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband
因为像伊莎贝拉和她丈夫这样的人

23
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.680
that I have devoted my career to studying this war
我为研究这场战争贡献了我的职业生涯

24
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.458
that we know so little about.
这场我们少有知晓的战争。

25
00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:43.082
Although there is one story about Congo that you may have heard.
不过你应该听说过一个关于刚果的故事。

26
00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:47.034
It's a story about minerals and rape.
一个关于矿产和强暴的故事。

27
00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:49.620
Policy statements and media reports
政策声明和媒体报道

28
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.354
both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo --
大部分时间都集中于刚果暴力的主要原因--

29
00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:59.132
the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources --
自然资源的非法开采与交易--

30
00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:01.869
and on a main consequence --
和一个主要后果--

31
00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.063
sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war.
把性虐待女人和女孩作为战争武器。

32
00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:13.040
So, not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are.
的确这些问题很重要也很悲惨。

33
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.798
But today I want to tell you  a different story.
不过我今天要讲一个不同的故事。

34
00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:24.103
I want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict.
我想告诉你一个强调战争主要原因的故事。

35
00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:31.220
Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom-up conflicts
在刚果，暴力的起因主要是本地由下到上的，

36
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.165
that international peace efforts have failed to help address.
国际和平努力未能提到的斗争。

37
00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:42.388
The story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable
这个故事的开始，是刚果不仅是

38
00:02:42.388 --> 00:02:46.705
for being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis,
世界正在进行的最糟人道危机，

39
00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:54.392
but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world.
也是一些最大的国际建设和平力量的所在地。

40
00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:56.505
Congo hosts the largest
刚果拥有全球最大并且

41
00:02:56.505 --> 00:03:01.350
and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world.
最贵的联合国维护和平团队。

42
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.049
It was also the site of the first European-led peacekeeping mission,
它也是第一支欧洲和平维护队伍所选之地。

43
00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.723
and for its first cases ever,
国际刑事执法也是第一次

44
00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:15.355
the International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.
选择控告刚果军阀。

45
00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:21.855
In 2006, when Congo held the first  free national elections in its history,
2006年，刚果举行历史上第一次全国自由选举时，

46
00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:27.991
many observers thought that an end to  violence in the region had finally come.
许多旁观者以为暴乱终于结束了。

47
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:34.120
The international community lauded the  successful organization of these elections
国际社区大力赞扬了成功推动选举的机构

48
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.915
as finally an example of successful international intervention in a failed state.
作为在一个失败的国家里成功进行国际调停的例子。

49
00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:42.673
But the eastern provinces
但是东边的省份

50
00:03:42.673 --> 00:03:46.080
have continued to face massive population displacements
依旧面临着大量的人口流失

51
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.653
and horrific human rights violations.
和可怕的人权侵犯。

52
00:03:49.653 --> 00:03:52.138
Shortly before I went back there last summer,
在我回刚果前不久，

53
00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:57.029
there was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu.
南基伏发生了一起惨烈的屠杀。

54
00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.065
Thirty-three people were killed.
三十三人被杀。

55
00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:01.797
They were mostly women and children,
他们中大部分是女人和孩子，

56
00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:04.986
and many of them were hacked to death.
很多都是被砍伤致死。

57
00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:07.889
During the past eight years,
在过去的八年里，

58
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.827
fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited
东刚果的战斗定期

59
00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:14.894
full-scale civil and international war.
重燃全面内战和国际战争。

60
00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:19.875
So basically, every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace,
简单来说，每次当我们感觉和平快要到来时，

61
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.717
the conflict explodes again.
战争就会爆发。

62
00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:24.435
Why?
为什么？

63
00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:27.407
Why have the massive international efforts
为什么大量国际的努力

64
00:04:27.407 --> 00:04:33.916
failed to help Congo  achieve lasting peace and security?
依旧无法让刚果达到长期的和平稳定？

65
00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:40.884
Well, my answer to this question revolves around two central observations.
我对这些问题的回答围绕着两个主要观察。

66
00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:46.917
First, one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo
第一，刚果暴乱持续的主要原因之一

67
00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.825
is fundamentally local --
其实是局部的--

68
00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:51.112
and when I say local,
当我说局部，

69
00:04:51.112 --> 00:04:54.643
I really mean at the level of the individual, the family,
我其实指的是个人级别，家庭，

70
00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:58.532
the clan, the municipality, the community, the district,
宗族，城市，社区，片区，

71
00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.771
sometimes the ethnic group.
有时种族。

72
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:06.299
For instance, you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you.
比如，你记得我给你们讲过的伊莎贝拉的故事吧。

73
00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:10.503
Well, the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village
民兵袭击她的村庄

74
00:05:10.503 --> 00:05:13.613
was because they wanted to take the land
是因为他们想要村民们

75
00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:18.328
that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive.
赖以生存的耕地。

76
00:05:18.328 --> 00:05:23.098
The second central observation is that international peace efforts
我的第二个主要观察是，国际和平努力

77
00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:27.062
have failed to help address local conflicts
因为现今建设和平的文化氛围，

78
00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:31.981
because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture.
没能顾及地方性斗争。

79
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:35.597
So what I mean is that
我想说的是，

80
00:05:35.597 --> 00:05:37.970
Western and African diplomats,
从事于解决战争的

81
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.817
United Nations peacekeepers, donors,
西方和非洲的外交官们，

82
00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:43.421
the staff of most nongovernmental organizations
联合国和平卫士，捐赠者们，

83
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:46.257
that work with the resolution of conflict,
大部分民间机构工作人员，

84
00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:51.035
they all share a specific way of seeing the world.
都用同样的视角在看待这个世界。

85
00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:55.041
And I was one of these people, and I shared this culture,
我以前也是他们之一，我也在这样的文化下,

86
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:59.033
so I know all too well how powerful it is.
所以我知道它有多强大。

87
00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:03.302
Throughout the world, and throughout conflict zones,
这个遍布世界和战争地区的普遍文化

88
00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:09.594
this common culture shapes the intervener's understanding of the causes of violence
让调停者认为暴乱的原因主要

89
00:06:09.594 --> 00:06:16.337
as something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres.
是在全国和国际范围内的。

90
00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:19.728
It shapes our understanding of the path toward peace
它使我们认为达到和平需要

91
00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:23.576
as something again that requires top-down intervention
自上而下的干预

92
00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:27.699
to address national and international tensions.
来解决全国和国际范围的紧张关系。

93
00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.418
And it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors
它也使我们认为外国角色的任务

94
00:06:31.418 --> 00:06:36.979
as engaging in national and international peace processes.
是参与到全国与国际范围的和平进程。

95
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.854
Even more importantly, this common culture
更重要的是，这个普遍文化

96
00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:52.300
enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level tensions that often jeopardize the macro-level settlements.
使国际和平建设者们忽略了危害宏观级别和解的微级矛盾。

97
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.401
So for instance, in Congo,
举个例子，在刚果，

98
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:58.615
because of how they are socialized and trained,
因为他们受到的社会和专业教育

99
00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:01.001
United Nations officials, donors, diplomats,
联合国工作人员，捐赠者，外交官，

100
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:04.160
the staff of most nongovernmental organizations,
非政府机构工作人员

101
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.170
they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top-down problem.
都把持续的战争与屠杀视为由上而下解决的问题。

102
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.394
To them, the violence they see
对他们来说，他们所见的暴乱

103
00:07:13.394 --> 00:07:18.374
is the consequence of tensions between President Kabila
是卡比拉总统和各个国家政敌

104
00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:26.037
and various national opponents, and tensions between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
的紧张关系，还有刚果、卢旺达、乌干达紧张关系的结果。

105
00:07:26.037 --> 00:07:32.108
In addition, these international  peacebuilders view local conflicts
此外，这些国际和平使者们仅仅把地区性矛盾

106
00:07:32.108 --> 00:07:37.901
as simply the result of national and international tensions,
看作是全国和国际紧张局势，

107
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:40.316
insufficient state authority,
薄弱的政府，

108
00:07:40.316 --> 00:07:45.980
and what they call the Congolese people's so-called inherent penchant for violence.
和他们所谓的刚果人民天生暴力倾向的结果。

109
00:07:47.184 --> 00:07:51.136
The dominant culture also constructs intervention
主流文化也使全国和国际层面调停

110
00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:53.969
at the national and international levels
成为联合国工作人员和外交官

111
00:07:53.969 --> 00:08:01.182
as the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats.
唯一自然正当的任务。

112
00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:07.627
And it elevates the organization of general elections, which is now a sort of cure-all,
它也把现在类似万灵药的普选组织升为

113
00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:11.411
as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism
最重要的国家重建机制，

114
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.936
over more effective state-building approaches.
甚至超过其他更有效的国家建设途径。

115
00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:21.163
And that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones.
这现象不仅在刚果，也发生在许多其他纷争地带。

116
00:08:21.163 --> 00:08:23.063
But let's dig deeper,
不过让我们再深入，

117
00:08:23.063 --> 00:08:26.153
into the other main sources of violence.
去探究暴乱的其他主要原因。

118
00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:29.682
In Congo, continuing violence
在刚果，持续暴乱

119
00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:34.695
is motivated not only by the national and international causes
不仅由全国与国际原因造成，

120
00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:39.002
but also by longstanding bottom-up agendas
也因为长期存在的由下到上的议程。

121
00:08:39.002 --> 00:08:42.963
whose main instigators are villagers, traditional chiefs,
村民们，酋长们，社区首领们和

122
00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:45.961
community chiefs or ethnic leaders.
民族领袖们是它们的主要煽动者。

123
00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:51.936
Many conflicts revolve around political, social and economic stakes
许多矛盾都围绕着明显地区性的

124
00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:54.764
that are distinctively local.
政治，社会和经济利益。

125
00:08:54.764 --> 00:09:00.128
For instance, there is a lot of competition at the village or district level
比如说，村庄和片区有许多关于谁能根据

126
00:09:00.128 --> 00:09:03.714
over who can be chief of village or chief of territory
传统条律成为村庄或区域的首领，

127
00:09:03.714 --> 00:09:09.516
according to traditional law, and who can control the distribution of land
谁能控制地产分布

128
00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:13.036
and the exploitation of local mining sites.
和矿产开采的竞争。

129
00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:17.256
This competition often results in localized fighting,
这样的竞争经常造成地区的打斗，

130
00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:21.040
for instance in one village or territory,
比如说在某村庄或片区，

131
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.983
and quite frequently, it escalates into generalized fighting,
经常升级为广泛的战争，

132
00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:27.112
so across a whole province,
横跨整个省份，

133
00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:30.451
and even at times into neighboring countries.
甚至有时附近的国家。

134
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:35.518
Take the conflict between Congolese  of Rwandan descent
举个例子，在刚果的卢旺达后裔

135
00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:40.429
and the so-called indigenous  communities of the Kivus.
和所谓的基伏原住民团体的战争

136
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:45.815
This conflict started in the 1930s during Belgian colonization,
从1930年左右，比利时殖民期，

137
00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:51.148
when both communities competed over access to land and to local power.
由土地使用权和当地政权的竞争开始。

138
00:09:51.148 --> 00:09:54.547
Then, in 1960, after Congolese independence,
接着，在1960年，刚果独立后，

139
00:09:54.547 --> 00:10:00.392
it escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians,
斗争因为双方尝试与国内政治家联盟而扩张，

140
00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:04.332
but still to advance their local agendas.
不过依旧只是为推动他们本地的议程。

141
00:10:04.332 --> 00:10:08.700
And then, at the time of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
后来，在1994乌干达种族屠杀时，

142
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.879
these local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,
这些地区性角色与刚果和乌干达武装分子联盟，

143
00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:20.209
but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus.
依旧为推动基伏片区的议程。

144
00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:27.563
And since then, these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence,
从那时开始，这些关于土地和政权的地区性矛盾便已为暴乱加油，

145
00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:29.809
and they have regularly jeopardized
它们也经常危害到

146
00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:33.532
the national and international settlements.
国内和国际的和议。

147
00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:39.167
So we can wonder why in these circumstances
所以我们可以纳闷为什么在这些情况下

148
00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:47.227
the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement local peacebuilding programs.
国际和平使者无法实施本地和平建设计划。

149
00:10:47.227 --> 00:10:52.073
And the answer is that international interveners
它的答案是，国际调和者们

150
00:10:52.073 --> 00:10:55.596
deem the resolution of grassroots conflict
把解决草根矛盾看作是

151
00:10:55.596 --> 00:11:00.830
an unimportant, unfamiliar, and illegitimate task.
不重要，不熟悉和不正当的任务。

152
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:10.317
The very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally with existing cultural norms,
参与地区性矛盾的概念从根本上就与现今文化的标准不符，

153
00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:14.200
and it threatens key organizational interests.
它也威胁重要机构的兴趣。

154
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.817
For instance, the very identity of the United Nations
比如说，如果联合国

155
00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:22.173
as this macro-level diplomatic organization
重新专注于地区性矛盾，它的定位，

156
00:11:22.173 --> 00:11:28.581
would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts.
一个宏观层面的外交机构，就会被颠倒。

157
00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:33.306
And the result is that neither the internal resistance
这些的结果就是，无论是内部对主要

158
00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:35.653
to the dominant ways of working
运行方式的反抗，

159
00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.396
nor the external shocks
还是外部打击，

160
00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:42.838
have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate
都没有说服国际角色去重新评估

161
00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:46.678
their understanding of violence and intervention.
他们对暴乱和调和的理解。

162
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.153
And so far, there have been only very few exceptions.
到目前为止只发生过几起例外。

163
00:11:51.153 --> 00:11:56.764
There have been exceptions, but only very few exceptions, to this broad pattern.
有例外发生过，但是与主流格局相比这些例外微乎其微。

164
00:11:58.034 --> 00:12:01.346
So to wrap up, the story I just told you
总的来说，我刚为你们讲的故事

165
00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:06.295
is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture
是一个关于主流和平建设文化

166
00:12:06.295 --> 00:12:11.102
shapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are,
如何形成调和者们对暴乱的起因，

167
00:12:11.102 --> 00:12:12.783
how peace is made,
和平的建设，

168
00:12:12.783 --> 00:12:16.395
and what interventions should accomplish.
和介入调停需要达到目的理解的故事。

169
00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:23.222
These understandings enable international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level foundations
这些理解使国际和平使者们忽视对可以持续的和平

170
00:12:23.222 --> 00:12:27.871
that are so necessary for sustainable peace.
极其重要的微级根基。

171
00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:30.864
The resulting inattention to local conflicts
所致使的对地区性矛盾的不注意

172
00:12:30.864 --> 00:12:34.882
leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term
造成不充分和平建设的短期结果

173
00:12:34.882 --> 00:12:38.888
and potential war resumption in the long term.
和可能回归战争的长期结果。

174
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:42.034
And what's fascinating is that this analysis
吸引人的是这个分析

175
00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:46.044
helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict
帮助我们更好理解许多持续的矛盾

176
00:12:46.044 --> 00:12:51.333
and international intervention failures, in Africa and elsewhere.
和国际调和在非洲和其他区域的失败。

177
00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:56.894
Local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post-war environments,
在战中和战后环境下，本地矛盾鼓动暴乱

178
00:12:56.894 --> 00:13:00.585
from Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor-Leste,
从阿富汗到苏丹到帝摩尔莱斯塔，

179
00:13:00.585 --> 00:13:07.273
and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive, bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,
在少有的拥有全面从下到上和平建设动机的例子里，

180
00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:12.767
these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable.
这些尝试都成功地创造了长期和平。

181
00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:15.577
One of the best examples is the contrast
最好的例子之一是

182
00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:19.988
between the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland,
相对平静的索马里兰，受益于

183
00:13:19.988 --> 00:13:25.198
which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,
维持的草根和平建设动机，

184
00:13:25.198 --> 00:13:32.765
and the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia, where peacebuilding has been mostly top-down.
和暴乱遍布的，和平建设主要由上到下的剩余索马里地区的对比。

185
00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:35.066
And there are several other cases
也有数个其他地区性、

186
00:13:35.066 --> 00:13:41.800
in which local, grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference.
草根的矛盾决议有重大成效的案例。

187
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.872
So if we want international peacebuilding to work,
所以如果我们想国际和平建设成功，

188
00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:49.694
in addition to any top-down intervention,
在从上到下调停的基础上，

189
00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:53.365
conflicts must be resolved from the bottom up.
矛盾需要从下到上解决。

190
00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:58.017
And again, it's not that national and international tensions don't matter.
再说一次，并不是全国和国际矛盾不重要。

191
00:13:58.017 --> 00:13:59.743
They do.
他们很重要。

192
00:13:59.743 --> 00:14:04.437
And it's not that national and international peacebuilding isn't necessary.
全国和国际和平建设也并不是不必要。

193
00:14:04.437 --> 00:14:05.820
It is.
它是需要的。

194
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:15.792
Instead, it is that both macro-level and micro-level peacebuilding are needed to make peace sustainable,
反之，要使和平持久，微观和宏观层面的和平建设都是需要的，

195
00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:17.933
and local nongovernmental organizations,
而且本地非政府机构，

196
00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:20.912
local authorities and  civil society representatives
本地权威和民间社区代表

197
00:14:20.912 --> 00:14:25.522
should be the main actors in the bottom-up process.
才应是从下到上过程的主要角色。

198
00:14:25.522 --> 00:14:27.951
So of course, there are obstacles.
所以障碍当然存在。

199
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:30.606
Local actors often lack the funding
本地角色时常缺少资金

200
00:14:30.606 --> 00:14:34.143
and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity
或者有时后勤物资和技术能力

201
00:14:34.143 --> 00:14:38.677
to implement effective, local peacebuilding programs.
去执行有效的本地和平建设计划。

202
00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:47.520
So international actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution.
所以国际角色应该为本地矛盾解决扩展他们的募资和支持。

203
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.876
As for Congo, what can be done?
至于刚果，能为它做什么呢？

204
00:14:50.876 --> 00:14:54.600
After two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions,
二十年战争和数百万死亡清楚地证明

205
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.635
it's clear that we need to change our approach.
我们必须改变我们的方法。

206
00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.043
Based on my field research,
根据我的实地调查，

207
00:15:00.043 --> 00:15:03.553
I believe that international and Congolese actors
我认为国际和刚果角色

208
00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:06.979
should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict
应该多加关注如何解决土地斗争

209
00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:11.499
and the promotion of inter-community reconciliation.
和促进社区之间的和平共处。

210
00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:14.141
So for instance, in the province of the Kivus,
比如说，在基伏地带，

211
00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:17.409
the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners
生命与和平协会和它的刚果合作伙伴

212
00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:20.504
have set up inter-community forums
建立了社区之间的论坛

213
00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:24.856
to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land,
用于讨论地区性土地斗争的细节，

214
00:15:24.856 --> 00:15:29.781
and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence.
并且这些论坛有找到控制暴乱的方案。

215
00:15:30.491 --> 00:15:36.917
That's the kind of program that is sorely needed throughout eastern Congo.
当下整个东刚果极其需要的就是这类计划。

216
00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:38.795
It's with programs like this
我们只有通过这样的计划

217
00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:43.745
that we can help people like Isabelle and her husband.
才能帮助像伊莎贝拉和她丈夫那样的人。

218
00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:46.268
So these will not be magic wands,
这些并不是魔法棒，

219
00:15:46.268 --> 00:15:51.936
but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence,
但是因为囊括了根深蒂固的暴乱起因，

220
00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:54.770
they could definitely be game-changers.
它们一定能成为转折点。

221
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.324
Thank you.
谢谢。

222
00:15:57.324 --> 00:16:00.556
(Applause)
