3
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.605
you could heal your wounds faster?

10
00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:44.391
Just like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease,

11
00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:47.143
we could instead instruct our immune system
我们也可以指导自身的免疫系统

12
00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:50.031
to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds.

14
00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:57.699
but there are several organisms that can achieve this feat.

22
00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:23.732
From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection,

33
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.988
So in this case,

34
00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:57.326
instead of the immune cells rushing off towards infection to fight bacteria,

35
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.337
they're rushing toward an injury.

44
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.993
and we'll get a scar.

45
00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.319
So if we don't have these helper T cells,

46
00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:25.930
instead of healthy muscle,
肌肉会在伤口里生成脂肪细胞，

47
00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:28.565
our muscle develops fat cells inside of it,

49
00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:34.253
Now, using our immune system,

57
00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:59.487
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps

60
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.246
the immune system creates a small environment of cells and proteins
