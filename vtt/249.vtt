00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:18.357
at the University of Pennsylvania,
一名机械工程教授

3
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.340
and my favorite hobby is photography.
我的爱好是摄影

4
00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:23.149
And as I travel around the world,
当我环游世界的时候

5
00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.325
I love taking photographs like these,
我喜欢像这样照相

6
00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.268
so I can remember all the beautiful and interesting things
这样我就可以记住我所有见到的

7
00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:29.570
that I've seen.
美丽有趣的事物

8
00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:33.270
But what I can't do is record and share
但是我没办法做到的是记录和分享

9
00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:36.643
how these objects feel to touch.
这些东西摸起来是什么感觉

10
00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.207
And that's kind of surprising,
而这也是一种会令人惊讶的感觉

11
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.496
because your sense of touch is really important.
因为你的触觉真的非常重要

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.390
It's involved in every physical interaction you do every day,
在你每天做的每一个身体的互动，

13
00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:45.964
every manipulation task, anything you do in the world.
每一个控制的动作，在这世界上你做的任何事情中 都有触觉的参与

14
00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:48.495
So the sense of touch is actually pretty interesting.
因此，触觉是很非常有趣的

15
00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.161
It has two main components.
它有两个主要组成要素

16
00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:52.522
The first is tactile sensations,
第一个是触感

17
00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.636
things you feel in your skin.
是你皮肤感受到的感觉

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.918
And the second is kinesthetic sensations.
第二个是运动觉

19
00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:00.132
This has to do with the position of your body and how it's moving,
而这与你的身体的位置，如何移动

20
00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:01.727
and the forces you encounter.
以及你所受的外力有关

21
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:03.648
And you're really good at incorporating
并且你很擅长

22
00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:05.878
both of these types of sensations together
结合这两者的感觉

23
00:01:05.902 --> 00:01:08.882
to understand the physical interactions you have with the world
去理解你和这个世界之间的互动

24
00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.731
and understand as you touch a surface:
和当你触摸到一个表面时

25
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.794
is it a rock, is it a cat, is it a bunny, what is it?
明白它是一个石块，还是一只猫，或是一个兔子， 它是什么呢？

26
00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:16.058
And so, as an engineer,
因此，作为一个工程师

27
00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.474
I'm really fascinated
我对此很着迷

28
00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.807
and I have a lot of respect for how good people are with their hands.
并且我对人们拥有一双手是多么好 感到很敬佩

29
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.733
And I'm intrigued and curious
同时我被勾起了好奇心

30
00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:25.168
about whether we could make technology better
关于我们是否可以让科技更好

31
00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:26.890
by doing a better job at leveraging
通过在用触觉影响人的能力方面

32
00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.036
the human capability with the sense of touch.
做得更好

33
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.993
Could I improve the interfaces to computers and machines

34
00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:34.590
by letting you take advantage of your hands?
通过让你运用你的双手的优势

35
00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:36.179
And indeed, I think we can,
确实，我认为我们可以

36
00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:38.795
and that's at the core of a field called haptics,
而那就是力触觉领域的核心

37
00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.549
and this is the area that I work in.
同时这也是我工作的领域

38
00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:42.918
It's all about interactive touch technology.
它就是交互是触摸技术

39
00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:44.095
And the way it works is,
它的原理

40
00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.624
as you move your body through the world,
就像是你在这个世界中移动你的肢体

41
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.932
if, as an engineer, I can make a system that can measure that motion,
如果，作为 一个工程师， 我可以制造一个可以测量那个动作，

42
00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:52.486
and then present to you sensations over time
并在之后再将触觉传感给你的系统

43
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.754
that kind of make sense,
那感觉就可以被感知到了

44
00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:56.452
that match up with what you might feel in the real world,
它与你在真实世界可能会有的感觉一致

45
00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:59.020
I can fool you into thinking you're touching something
我可以骗你让你以为你正在触摸某物

46
00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.729
even though there's nothing there.
尽管那什么都没有

47
00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.369
So here are three examples
好了，这有三个例子

48
00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:05.503
and these are all done from research in my lab at Penn.
这些都是在我在宾大的实验室里的研究中完成

49
00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:08.784
The first one is all about that same problem that I was showing you:
第一个就是关于我刚向你们展示过的一个问题

50
00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:10.775
how can we capture how objects feel
我们如何能够捕获到对物体的感觉

51
00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.796
and recreate those experiences?
然后再现那些感觉

52
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.819
So the way we solve this problem
所以我们解决这个问题的方法是

53
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.908
is by creating a hand-held tool
通过制造一个便携的工具

54
00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:18.804
that has many different sensors inside.
这里面有很多不同的传感器

55
00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:22.180
It has a force sensor, so we can tell how hard you're pushing;
它有一个力传感器，所以我们可以了解到你的推力有多大

56
00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.512
it has motion tracking, so we can tell exactly where you've moved it;
它有一个运动跟踪器， 所以我们可以准确了解到你将它移到了哪里

57
00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:28.226
and it has a vibration sensor, an accelerometer, inside,
它还有一个震动传感器，一个加速计在里面

58
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.692
that detects the shaking back and forth of the tool
它可以察觉到这个工具的前后震动

59
00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.748
that lets you know that's a piece of canvas
这可以让你知道那个东西是一块帆布

60
00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:34.794
and not a piece of silk or something else.
不是一块丝绸或其他什么东西

61
00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:37.457
Then we take the data we record from these interactions.
然后我们获取这些交互传感器中记录的数据

62
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:38.775
Here's ten seconds of data.
这是十秒的记录

63
00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.684
You can see how the vibrations get larger and smaller,
你可以看到这些震动是如何随着你的运动

64
00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:43.184
depending on how you move.
变大或变小

65
00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.951
And we make a mathematical model of those relationships
接着我们对这些关系建立数学模型

66
00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.394
and program them into a tablet computer
并将它们编程写入平板电脑中

67
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.982
so that when you take the stylus
因此当你拿着这个尖笔

68
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.435
and go and touch the screen,
去触摸这个屏幕时

69
00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.289
that voice-coil actuator in the white bracket
那个在白色托架中的音圈制动器

70
00:02:54.313 --> 00:02:56.580
plays vibrations to give you the illusion
产生震动让你产生

71
00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:58.634
that you're touching the real surface,
你正在触摸物体真正的表面的错觉

72
00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:01.927
just like if you touched, dragged back and forth, on the real canvas.
就好比像你在触碰，前后拉拽真正的帆布

73
00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:03.892
We can create very compelling illusions.
我们可以创造非常强烈的幻觉

74
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:07.486
We can do this for all kinds of surfaces and it's really a lot of fun.
我们可以使所有种类的表面实现这个 它真的非常有意思

75
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.427
We call it haptography -- haptic photography.
我们称之为触觉反馈技术--触觉的摄影术

76
00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:14.231
And I think it has potential benefits in all sorts of areas
并且我认为它在各种领域都有潜在的价值

77
00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.961
like online shopping, maybe interactive museum exhibits,
比如线上购物，又或许是互动博物馆

78
00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:19.739
where you're not supposed to touch the precious artifacts,
在那里你不被允许触摸珍贵的艺术品

79
00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:21.139
but you always want to.
但你总是想去碰

80
00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:24.841
The second example I want to tell you about comes from a collaboration I have
我想为你讲述的第二个例子

81
00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:27.207
with Dr. Margrit Maggio at the Penn Dental School.
是来自我和宾大牙科学院 Margrit Maggio医生的一个合作成果

82
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:29.246
Part of her job is to teach dental students
她工作的一部分是教牙科的学生

83
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.052
how to tell where in a patient's mouth there are cavities.
如何知道在病人的口中哪有龋洞

84
00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:33.597
Of course they look at X-rays,
当然他们会看X光

85
00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:36.871
but a large part of this clinical judgment comes from what they feel
但是这样的临床诊断的一大部分是来自他们的感觉

86
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:39.261
when they touch your teeth with a dental explorer.
当他们用牙探针触碰你的牙齿时

87
00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.293
You've all had this happen, they go across.
你们都经历过这个，这很普遍

88
00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:44.860
What they're feeling for is if the tooth is really hard, then it's healthy,
如果这个牙齿是非常坚硬的他们感觉到的是什么， 那说明它很健康

89
00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.630
but if it's kind of soft and sticky,
但如果它是软的并且黏糊糊的

90
00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:49.158
that's a signal that the enamel is starting to decay.
那是牙釉质蛀蚀的标识

91
00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:52.403
These types of judgments are hard for a new dental student to make,
做出这些种类的判断对一个新牙科学生来说是困难的

92
00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.685
because they haven't touched a lot of teeth yet.
因为他们还没有触碰过很多的牙齿

93
00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.547
And you want them to learn this before they start practicing
而你想要他们在为真正的病人实践之前

94
00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.731
on real human patients.
掌握这些

95
00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:03.041
So what we do is add an accelerometer on to the dental explorer,
所以我们做的是在牙探针中加入一个加速计

96
00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:04.998
and then we record what Dr. Maggio feels
然后我们将Maggio医生触碰不同的拔出的牙齿时

97
00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:07.192
as she touches different extracted teeth.
所感知的内容记录下来

98
00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:09.979
And we can play it back for you as a video
然后我们将它用视频的形式给你播放

99
00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:11.656
with a touch track --
通过一个触碰跟踪--

100
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.899
not just a sound track, but also a touch track,
不仅是一个声音跟踪，也是一个触碰跟踪

101
00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:16.249
that you can feel by holding that repeating tool.
你就可以通过拿着那个重复工具来感知

102
00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:19.566
You feel the same things the dentist felt when they did the recording,
你可以感觉到牙医做记录时和他一样的感觉

103
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.031
and practice making judgments.
并练习做出判断

104
00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.217
So here's a sample one.
这有一个样本

105
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.730
Here's a tooth that looks kind of suspicious, right?
这有一个牙齿它看起来有些可疑，对吗？

106
00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:27.278
It has all those brown stains.
它有很多的棕色污渍

107
00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:30.785
You might be thinking, "We should definitely put a filling in this tooth."
你可能会认为， “很明显我们应该放一些填充物在这个牙齿里”

108
00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.769
But if you pay attention to how it feels,
但是如果你注意到了它的触感是什么样的

109
00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:35.427
all the surfaces of this tooth are hard and healthy,
这个牙齿的所有表面都是坚硬并且健康的

110
00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.710
so this patient does not need a filling.
所以这个病人不需要填补牙齿

111
00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:40.857
And these are exactly the kind of judgments doctors make every day
这些的确是医生每天都要做的判断

112
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.953
and I think this technology we've invented has a lot of potential
我认为我们已经发明的这个技术

113
00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:47.428
for many different things in medical training, because it's really simple
在医疗训练中的不同处有很多的潜能， 因为它真的很简单

114
00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:50.998
and it does a great job at recreating what people feel through tools.
并且它在再现人们通过工具得到的感觉方面做得非常好

115
00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:54.042
I think it could also help make games more interactive and fun
我想它还可以让游戏更加具有互动性和有趣

116
00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:56.643
and more realistic in the sensations that you feel.
并且在你的感觉上更加真实

117
00:04:56.667 --> 00:05:00.296
The last example I want to tell you about is again about human movement.
我想讲的最后一个例子还是关于人的动作

118
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.320
So if any of you have ever learned sports,
如果你们都曾学习过体育运动

119
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.607
how do you get good at something like surfing?
你是如何熟练掌握像冲浪这样的运动的呢？

120
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:05.782
You practice.
你练习

121
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.668
You practice some more and more, right?
你一次又一次地去练习，对吗？

122
00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:10.761
Making small corrections, maybe getting some input from a coach,
做一些小的改正，可能是从教练那得到一些建议

123
00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:12.561
learning how to improve your motions.
学习如何改进你的动作

124
00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:14.047
I think we could use computers
我认为我们可以使用电脑

125
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.667
to help make that process more efficient and more fun.
来让那个过程更加高效并且更加有趣

126
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.651
And so here, for example, if I have six different arm movements
举个例子，这就是如果我有六个不同的手臂摆动

127
00:05:19.675 --> 00:05:20.871
that I want you to learn,
需要你去学习

128
00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:24.271
you come into my lab at Penn and try out our system.
你来到我在宾大的实验室然后试用我们的系统

129
00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:27.754
We use a Kinect to measure your motions, we show graphics on the screen,
我们用一个Kinect（XBOX360体感周边外设）来测量 你的动作，我们在屏幕上展示图片

130
00:05:27.778 --> 00:05:29.871
and then we also give you touch cues,
然后我们还会给你一些触碰提示

131
00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.483
haptic feedback on your arm,
触觉反馈在你的手臂上

132
00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:34.867
delivered by these haptic arm bands which have motors inside,
通过这些里面有电动机的触觉臂带来传递，

133
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.462
and guide you as you move.
并且在你运动的时候引导你

134
00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:37.752
So, if we put it together,
所以，如果我们把它放到一起

135
00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:40.101
as you're trying to track this motion,
当你正在尝试跟踪这个动作时，

136
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.289
if you deviate -- say, maybe, your arm is a little too high --
如果你偏离了--假设，可能是，你的手高了一点点--

137
00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:45.422
we turn on the motors right there on the skin
我们把在这皮肤上的电动机打开

138
00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.217
to let you know you should move down,
来让你知道你应该向下移一点

139
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:49.103
almost like a coach gently guiding you
就很像一个教练温柔地指导你

140
00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:52.018
and helping you master these movements more quickly
帮助你更快地掌握这些动作

141
00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:53.891
and make more precise corrections.
和做些更加精确的改正

142
00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:56.677
We developed this system for use in stroke rehabilitation,
我们为在中风康复中的使用开发了这个系统

143
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:59.005
but I think there are a lot of applications,
