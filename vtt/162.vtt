A lot of it.

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:22.023
And it comes with the territory of my work.
这跟我的工作领域有关。

5
00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:23.602
I'm a digital creator,

I make things specifically for the internet.
专门制作网络作品。

7
00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:30.959
Like, a few years ago, I made a video series called "Every Single Word"
大概几年前，我制作了一个 视频系列，名叫“每字每句“，

8
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.049
where I edited down popular films

9
00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:35.921
to only the words spoken by people of color,

10
00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:40.289
as a way to empirically and accessibly talk about the issue of representation
以此来直观实际地讨论 好莱坞的有色群体代表

11
00:00:40.313 --> 00:00:41.463
in Hollywood.
这一话题。

12
00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.302
Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill
后来，由于“跨性别厕所令”

13
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:48.865
started gaining media attention around the United States,
开始在全美范围引发媒体关注，

14
00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:51.509
I hosted and produced an interview series

15
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.302
called "Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People"

16
00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.992
where I did exactly that.
真的是坐在厕所里访谈。

17
00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:57.183
(Laughter)
（笑声）

18
00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:58.398
And then --

19
00:00:58.422 --> 00:00:59.889
Sure, I'll take applause.

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:07.625
And then, are you familiar with those unboxing videos on YouTube

23
00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.216
where YouTubers open up the latest electronic gadgets?

24
00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:14.611
Great, so I satirized those in a weekly series,
好的，那为了讽刺他们， 我又做了一个周播系列，

25
00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:18.088
where instead I unboxed intangible ideologies
不过我拆箱的是无形的意识形态，

26
00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:23.538
like police brutality, masculinity and the mistreatment of Native Americans.
比如警察暴行，男性气概 和对美洲原住民的虐待。

27
00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:24.812
(Laughter)
（笑声）

28
00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:26.018
My work --

29
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:27.193

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:31.414
(Laughter)
（笑声）

32
00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:32.605
Mom, hi.
嗨，是你啊，老妈。

33
00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:35.160
(Laughter)
（笑声）

34
00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.976
So, my work became popular.
于是我的作品火起来了，

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.152
Very popular.
非常火。

36
00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:42.357
I got millions of views, a ton of great press
有数百万浏览量，大量媒体报导，

37
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:44.248
and a slew of new followers.
我还多了一群新的追随者。

38
00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:47.603
But the flip side of success on the internet
但是在网上成功的另一面

39
00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:49.190
is internet hate.
是网络仇恨。

40
00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:51.358
I was called everything.
我被冠以各种称号。

41
00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:57.175
From "beta" to "snowflake" and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck."
“贝塔“、" 雪片人“， 当然，还有一直很流行的“绿帽侠”。

42
00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:59.854
Don't worry, I will break these terms down for you.
别担心，我会一个一个解释。

43
00:01:59.878 --> 00:02:01.048
(Laughter)
（笑声）

44
00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:03.556
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar,
“贝塔”，如果你不了解这个词的话，

45
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.833
is shorthand online lingo for "beta male."
它是网络词汇“贝塔男” （性格温和，带点阴柔美的男性）的缩写。

46
00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:09.596
But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings
不过说真的，我戴着珍珠耳环，

47
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.905
and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands,
而我的时尚观是白富美上班族，

48
00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.016
so I'm not angling to be an alpha.
压根儿没想成为阿尔法女 （比男性更出色的女性，类似女汉子）。

49
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.603
(Applause)
（鼓掌）

50
00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:18.961
Doesn't totally work.
完全没可能嘛。

51
00:02:19.948 --> 00:02:21.077
(Laughter)
（笑声）

52
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:24.429
Now, "snowflake" is a put-down for people who are sensitive
再来说“雪片人”， 它是形容一个人很敏感，

53
00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:26.484
and believe themselves to be unique,
觉得自己很特殊，

54
00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:30.270
and I'm a millennial and an only child, so, duh!
而我是千禧一代（80年以后出生）， 又是独生子，所以，还真说对了！

55
00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:32.802
(Laughter)
（笑声）

56
00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:36.561
But my favorite, favorite, favorite is "cuck."
但是我最、最、最爱的 还是绿帽侠“cuck"。

57
00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:39.381
It's a slur, short for "cuckold,"
它是被戴绿帽的人 "cuckold"的简读，

58
00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.135
for men who have been cheated on by their wives.
指被自己妻子背叛的男人。

59
00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.390
But friends, I am so gay,
可是朋友们呐，我是同性恋，

60
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:48.278
that if I had a wife, I would encourage her to cheat on me.
就算真有妻子， 我也会鼓励她出轨。

61
00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.508
(Laughter)
（笑声）

62
00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:51.682
Thank you.
谢谢。

63
00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:56.169
Let's take a look at some of this negativity in action.
让我们回到正题，看几个负面评论。

64
00:02:56.913 --> 00:02:58.445
Sometimes it's direct.
有时评论很直接。

65
00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.890
Like Marcos, who wrote,
像马科斯，他写道，

66
00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:02.210
"You're everything I hate in a human being."
“你身上具有一切我讨厌的人类特征。”

67
00:03:02.643 --> 00:03:03.843
Thank you, Marcos.
马科斯，谢谢哈。

68
00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:06.096
Others are more concise.
有些就更简洁些。

69
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.615
Like Donovan, who wrote, "gaywad fagggggg."
像多诺万，他写的是， “土里土气的基佬。“

70
00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.302
Now, I do need to point out, Donovan is not wrong, OK?
对了，我有必要说下， 多诺万并没有错。

71
00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:18.381
In fact, he's right on both counts, so credit where credit is due.
实际上他两点都说对了， 得给予他认可。

72
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:19.557
Thank you, Donovan.
多诺万，也谢谢你啦。

73
00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:22.812
Others write to me with questions, like Brian, who asked,
还有人问问题，像布莱恩，他问，

74
00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:26.953
"Were you born a bitch or did you just learn to be one over time?"
“你是天生的婊子还是后天学成的？”

75
00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:29.318
But my favorite thing about this
不过我最喜欢的就是

76
00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:33.048
is that once Brian was done typing, his finger must have slipped
布莱恩打完字肯定手滑了，

77
00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:36.559
because then he sent me the thumbs-up emoji.
因为他接着发了一个“赞”的表情。

78
00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:37.853
(Laughter)
（笑声）

79
00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:40.380
So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.
所以，亲，我也给你个赞吧。

80
00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:42.900
(Laughter)
（笑声）

81
00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:46.270
It's fun to talk about these messages now.
这些网友留言说起来很好玩。

82
00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:47.445
Right?
对吧？

83
00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.943
And it's cathartic to laugh at them.
调侃这些留言也是一种宣泄。

84
00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:55.233
But I can tell you that it really does not feel good to receive them.
但是我可以告诉大家 接到它们的滋味可真不好受。

85
00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:59.050
At first, I would screenshot their comments
一开始，我会截屏网友的评论

86
00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:00.754
and make fun of their typos,
然后取笑他们的拼写错误，

87
00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:04.792
but this soon felt elitist and ultimately unhelpful.
不过很快我就觉得自己太“高高在上”， 而且最终这也没啥用。

88
00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:09.113
So over time, I developed an unexpected coping mechanism.
所以逐渐地，我研究出 一套新奇的应付机制。

89
00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:12.842
Because most of these messages I received were through social media,
因为多数我收到的留言 都是通过社交媒体，

90
00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:16.386
I could often click on the profile picture of the person who sent them
我经常可以点开 发送人的个人资料图片，

91
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.799
and learn everything about them.
了解他们的所有信息。

92
00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:20.791
I could see pictures they were tagged in,
我能看见标记了他们的图片，

93
00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:22.950
posts they'd written, memes they'd shared,
他们写的帖子，分享的谜因，

94
00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:26.794
and somehow, seeing that it was a human on the other side of the screen
知道屏幕另一边有一个人存在

95
00:04:26.818 --> 00:04:28.461
made me feel a little better.
多少能让我感觉好一些。

96
00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:31.294
Not to justify what they wrote, right?
不是去证实他们 写的对不对，可以理解吧？

97
00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:33.185
But just to provide context.
只是去了解下背景。

98
00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:37.175
Still, that didn't feel like enough.
但是，感觉还缺点什么。

99
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.199
So, I called some of them --
所以，我给其中一些人打电话——

100
00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:42.746
only the ones I felt safe talking to --

101
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.373
with a simple opening question:
用一个简单的问题开场：

102
00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:46.931
"Why did you write that?"
“你为什么要写那个（评论）？”

103
00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:50.294
The first person I spoke to was Josh.

104
00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:52.663
He had written to tell me that I was a moron,

105
00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:55.151
I was a reason this country was dividing itself,

106
00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:59.107
and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.
结尾他又补充说 同性恋是一种罪恶。

107
00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.177
I was so nervous for our first conversation.
第一次对话我紧张极了。

108
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:04.852
This wasn't a comments section.
这可不是网友评论部分，

109
00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:08.048
So I couldn't use tools like muting or blocking.
所以我不能静音或屏蔽。

110
00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:11.504
Of course, I guess, I could have hung up on him.
当然，我想， 我本来也可以挂断的。

111
00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:13.524
But I didn't want to.
但是我不想。

112
00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:15.760
Because I liked talking to him.
因为我喜欢跟他说话。

113
00:05:15.784 --> 00:05:17.118
Because I liked him.
说实话我挺喜欢他的。

114
00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:20.642
Here's a clip of one of our conversations.

you're about to graduate high school, right?

118
00:05:26.628 --> 00:05:28.135
DM: How is high school for you?
迪伦·马龙： 那你的高中怎么样？

119
00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.937
Josh: Am I allowed to use the H-E-double-hockey-stick word?
乔什：我可以说H-E-L-L 这样骂人的话吗？

120
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.651
DM: Oh, yeah. You're allowed to.
迪伦·马龙：行，说吧。

121

DM: Really?

乔什：虽然只有两周就毕业了， 但我现在还感觉跟在地狱似的。

124
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.709
I'm a little bit bigger -- I don't like to use the word "fat,"
我体型比较大—— 我不喜欢用“胖”这个词，

125
00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:44.372
but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates
我只是比很多同学都大了一圈儿，

126
00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:48.334
and they seem to judge me before they even got to know me.
可是他们甚至还不认识我呢， 就对我指指点点。

127
00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:49.627
DM: That's awful.

I was bullied in high school, too.

130
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.286
So did our common ground of being bullied in high school

131
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.843
erase what he wrote me?
他写给我的那些东西？

132
00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:03.572
No.
不会。

133
00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:06.723
And did our single phone conversation
我们这一通电话交流

134
00:06:06.747 --> 00:06:09.628
radically heal a politically divided country

135
00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.953
and cure systemic injustice?

136
00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:14.571
No, absolutely not, right?
不会，完全不会，对吧？

137
00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:18.151
But did our conversation humanize us to each other
但是我们的对话 是不是比个人资料图片和发帖

138
00:06:18.175 --> 00:06:21.356
more than profile pictures and posts ever could?
都更能拉近彼此的距离？

139
00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:22.897
Absolutely.
当然。

140
00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:24.777
I didn't stop there.
我没有就此止步。

141
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.603
Because some of the hate I received was from "my side."

142
00:06:28.943 --> 00:06:32.866
So when Matthew, a queer liberal artist like me

publicly wrote that I represented some of the worst aspects of liberalism,

through epically worded video essays and comments and posts,

Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do

Now in every one of my calls,

I always ask my guests to tell me about themselves.

194

is a key ingredient in getting these conversations off the ground,

to be empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with.

pack my bags and grab my one-way ticket to hell, right?

It just means that I'm acknowledging
