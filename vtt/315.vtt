1
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.070
Like many of us,
与许多人一样，

2
00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:17.010
I've had several careers in my life,
我一生中做过很多工作，

3
00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.185
and although they've been varied,
尽管它们各有不同，

4
00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:23.096
my first job set the foundation for all of them.
但是我的第一份工作却为所有的工作奠定了基石。

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.133
I was a home-birth midwife throughout my 20s.
在20多岁时，我是一位家庭助产士。

6
00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:32.567
Delivering babies taught me valuable and sometimes surprising things,
接生孩子教会了我许多宝贵乃至不可思议的事情，

7
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:35.361
like how to start a car at 2am.
比如如何在凌晨两点当气温是零下十度的时候，

8
00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.183
when it's 10 degrees below zero.
发动汽车。

9
00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:38.208
(Laughter)
（笑声）

10
00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:42.567
Or how to revive a father who's fainted at the sight of blood.
如何唤醒一个晕血的父亲。

11
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:43.642
(Laughter)
（笑声）

12
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.112
Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so,
如何剪脐带，

13
00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:48.357
to make a beautiful belly button.
才能形成一个漂亮的肚脐眼。

14
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.166
But those aren't the things that stuck with me or guided me
但是在我不做助产士之后

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.174
when I stopped being a midwife and started other jobs.
这些事情就不再是我生活的指引

16
00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:00.291
What stuck with me was this bedrock belief
一直陪伴我的是这个坚如磐石的观念：

17
00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:05.327
that each one of us comes into this world with a unique worth.
我们每一个人出生都是具有独特价值的

18
00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:09.473
When I looked into the face of a newborn,
当我看着新生儿的脸蛋时，

19
00:01:10.012 --> 00:01:13.705
I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,
我看到了价值，

20
00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.571
that sense of unapologetic selfhood,
看到了真实不屈的自我，

21
00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.771
that unique spark.
看到了独特的闪光。

22
00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:24.163
I use the word "soul" to describe that spark,
我用“灵魂”去描述那一道闪光，

23
00:01:24.187 --> 00:01:28.826
because it's the only word in English that comes close to naming
因为这是英语中唯一意思接近

24
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.562
what each baby brought into the room.
每一个婴儿所带来事物的单词。

25
00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:37.111
Every newborn was as singular as a snowflake,
每一个新生儿都如雪花般独特，

26
00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:40.506
a matchless mash-up of biology
都是自然、世族和神秘

27
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.194
and ancestry and mystery.
无法媲美的融合。

28
00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:45.851
And then that baby grows up,
当他们长大时，

29
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.990
and in order to fit into the family,
为了融入家庭，

30
00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:50.055
to conform to the culture,
顺应文化，

31
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.349
to the community, to the gender,
顺应团体，顺应性别角色，

32
00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:57.474
that little one begins to cover its soul, layer by layer.
他们开始一层又一层的掩盖灵魂。

33
00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.731
We're born this way,
我们生来如此，

34
00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.383
but --
但是

35
00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:02.999
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:06.012
But as we grow, a lot of things happen to us
但是随着我们长大，

37
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.870
that make us ...
许多发生在我们身上的事情

38
00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:14.779
want to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity.
使得我们想去掩盖灵魂上的独特和真实。

39
00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:16.170
We've all done this.
我们都这么做了。

40
00:02:16.194 --> 00:02:19.033
Everyone in this room is a former baby --
这个屋子里的每一个人，

41
00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:20.079
(Laughter)
（笑声）

42
00:02:20.103 --> 00:02:22.588
with a distinctive birthright.
都曾是一个独特的孩子。

43
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.596
But as adults, we spend so much of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,
但作为成人，我们大多数时间都无法轻松自信的生活

44
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.598
like we have ADD: authenticity deficit disorder.
就像得了“真实性缺乏综合症”一样。

45
00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.877
But not those babies --
但还好孩子们

46
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:36.143
not yet.
还没有变成这样。

47
00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.945
Their message to me was:
我从孩子那里学到：

48
00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:40.524
uncover your soul
去发现你的灵魂，

49
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:44.975
and look for that soul-spark in everyone else.
并去找寻他人灵魂中的闪光。

50
00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.222
It's still there.
它仍在那里。

51
00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:49.754
And here's what I learned from laboring women.
我从产妇那里学到：

52
00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:53.234
Their message was about staying open,
保持开放态度，

53
00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:55.485
even when things are painful.
甚至这是痛苦的。

54
00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:58.832
A woman's cervix normally looks like this.
通常而言，女人的子宫颈看起来像这样。

55
00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.006
It's a tight little muscle
它是子宫底部

56
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.657
at the base of the uterus.
一块紧致的小肌肉。

57
00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:08.778
And during labor, it has to stretch from this to this.
而当生产时，它必须从这么大扩张至这么大。

58
00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:10.065
Ouch!
哎哟！

59
00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.695
If you fight against that pain,
如果你与痛苦做抗争，

60
00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:14.847
you just create more pain,
你只会变得更痛苦，

61
00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:17.627
and you block what wants to be born.
并且堵住那跃跃欲出的生命。

62
00:03:18.302 --> 00:03:22.140
I'll never forget the magic that would happen
我永远不会忘记

63
00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:24.807
when a woman stopped resisting the pain
当女人停止对痛苦的抵抗并要张开宫口时，

64
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.292
and opened.
将会发生的奇迹。

65
00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:30.483
It was as if the forces of the universe took notice
那就像全宇宙的力量汇集，

66
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:33.126
and sent in a wave of help.
送来一阵帮助。

67
00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:35.715
I never forgot that message,
我永远不会忘记那条讯息，

68
00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.322
and now, when difficult or painful things happen to me in my life or my work,
现在，当我在生活或工作中遇到困难或痛苦之事时，

69
00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.357
of course at first I resist them,
起初我会抵抗，

70
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.605
but then I remember what I learned from the mothers:
但后来我便会想起我从母亲们那里学到的：

71
00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.962
stay open.
保持开放，

72
00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:50.757
Stay curious.
保持好奇。

73
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:53.486
Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.
探寻痛苦将要带来什么。

74
00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.295
Something new wants to be born.
新的事物想要到来。

75
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.429
And there was one more big soulful lesson,
还有更大的一课，

76
00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:02.247
and that one I learned from Albert Einstein.
那是我从爱因斯坦那里学到的。

77
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.545
He wasn't at any of the births, but --
这与生产无关，但是

78
00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.601
(Laughter)
（笑声）

79
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:08.267
It was a lesson about time.
这是关于时间的一课。

80
00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:13.705
At the end of his life, Albert Einstein concluded
在他生命的晚期，爱因斯坦总结出

81
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.250
that our normal, hamster-wheel experience of life is an illusion.
我们平凡忙碌的生活体验不过是幻觉一场。

82
00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.056
We run round and round, faster and faster,
我们不停的奔走，越来越快，

83
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.703
trying to get somewhere.
试图到达一个地方。

84
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.259
And all the while,
而自始至终，

85
00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:30.467
underneath surface time is this whole other dimension
在这些表象下，时间在另一个维度

86
00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:35.807
where the past and the present and the future merge
将过去、现在和将来融合，

87
00:04:36.187 --> 00:04:38.760
and become deep time.
成为深度时间。

88
00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:41.929
And there's nowhere to get to.
我们无处可去。

89
00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:46.885
Albert Einstein called this state, this dimension,
爱因斯坦将这种状态，这种维度

90
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.570
"only being."
称作为“唯一的存在”。

91
00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:50.550
And he said when he experienced it,
他说当他切身体会时，

92
00:04:50.574 --> 00:04:52.881
he knew sacred awe.
他感受到了圣神的敬畏。

93
00:04:53.638 --> 00:04:55.287
When I was delivering babies,
当我接生孩子时，

94
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:57.206
I was forced off the hamster wheel.
我脱离了忙碌的生活节奏。

95
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.009
Sometimes I had to sit for days, hours and hours,
有时我要坐几个小时乃至几天，

96
00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.619
just breathing with the parents;
只是与父母们共呼吸；

97
00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:04.979
just being.
只是存在。

98
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.435
And I got a big dose of sacred awe.
而我也感到了那种圣神的敬畏。

99
00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:13.630
So those are the three lessons I took with me from midwifery.
所以这是我从助产士生涯中学到的三课：

100
00:05:14.073 --> 00:05:16.518
One: uncover your soul.
第一，发现你的灵魂。

101
00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:23.364
Two: when things get difficult or painful, try to stay open.
第二，当事情变得困难或痛苦时，保持开放心态。

102
00:05:23.388 --> 00:05:27.321
And three: every now and then, step off your hamster wheel
第三，时不时的脱离忙碌的生活，

103
00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:29.370
into deep time.
进入深度时间。

104
00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:33.953
Those lessons have served me throughout my life,
这三课伴随我一生，

105
00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:37.134
but they really served me recently,
而最近当我从事生命中最重要的工作时，

106
00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:41.746
when I took on the most important job of my life thus far.
他们变得格外有用。

107
00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:46.758
Two years ago, my younger sister came out of remission
两年前，我的妹妹被诊断出

108
00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:49.141
from a rare blood cancer,
患有一种罕见的血癌，

109
00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.862
and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant.
而可行的治疗方案仅剩骨髓移植。

110
00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:57.617
And against the odds, we found a match for her,
历经千难万苦，我们为她找到了配型，

111
00:05:57.641 --> 00:05:59.551
who turned out to be me.
而那个配型就是我。

112
00:06:00.614 --> 00:06:03.393
I come from a family of four girls,
我来自一个四姐妹之家，

113
00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:10.308
and when my sisters found out that I was my sister's perfect genetic match,
当我的姐妹们发现我是妹妹的最佳配型时，

114
00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:12.662
their reaction was, "Really? You?"
她们的反应是，“真的吗？你？”

115
00:06:12.686 --> 00:06:14.069
(Laughter)
（笑声）

116
00:06:14.093 --> 00:06:16.249
"A perfect match for her?"
“你是她的最佳配型？”

117
00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.803
Which is pretty typical for siblings.
这对兄弟姐妹来说太典型了。

118
00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:22.017
In a sibling society, there's lots of things.

120
00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:27.918
But there's also jealousy

00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:29.707
and competition
和竞争，

122
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.853
and rejection and attack.
排斥和攻击。

123
00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:39.625
In siblinghood, that's where we start assembling many of those first layers
在兄妹关系中，我们开始对灵魂

124
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.136
that cover our soul.
进行第一层的隐藏。

125
00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:44.929
When I discovered I was my sister's match,
当我发现和我妹妹配型成功时，

126
00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:46.670
I went into research mode.
我开启了搜索模式。

127
00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:48.604
And I discovered that
我发现

128
00:06:49.848 --> 00:06:52.582
the premise of transplants is pretty straightforward.
移植的前期治疗十分直截了当：

129
00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:55.866
You destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient
利用大量化疗手段

130
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.626
with massive doses of chemotherapy,
摧毁癌症病人的所有骨髓，

131
00:06:59.113 --> 00:07:01.523
and then you replace that marrow

132
00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:05.387
with several million healthy marrow cells from a donor.
进行移植替换。

133
00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:07.563
And then you do everything you can
再次，用尽方法确保

134
00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:11.872
to make sure that those new cells engraft in the patient.
新的细胞在病人体内成长。

135
00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:16.794
I also learned that bone marrow transplants are fraught with danger.
同时我了解到骨髓移植充满着风险。

136
00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:22.128
If my sister made it through the near-lethal chemotherapy,
尽管我的妹妹能够熬过近乎置人于死地的化疗，

137
00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:25.738
she still would face other challenges.

139

might attack her body.
可能会攻击她的身体。

140
00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:34.642
And her body might reject my cells.
并且，她的身体可能会排斥我的细胞。

141
00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:37.111
They call this rejection or attack,
他们称之为排斥反应或攻击反应，

142
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:38.761
and both could kill her.
这都会杀了她。

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:41.395
Rejection. Attack.
排斥。攻击。

144
00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:44.102

00:07:47.663 --> 00:07:50.472
My sister and I had a long history of love,
我妹妹和我有过长时间的友爱，

147
00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:53.788

where we talked about the deeper stuff;
