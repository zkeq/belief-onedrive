Film, it's an incredible medium,

but essentially, it's the same now as it was then.

46
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.349
It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence.

47
00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.182
And we've done incredible things with those rectangles.

48
00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:51.067
But I started thinking about,

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:55.436
is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies

and tell different kinds of stories

而这些用我们已经使用了100年的传统的电影制作工具却无法实现？

53
00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:08.605
So I started experimenting,

54
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:13.694
and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine.

And here's one of the early experiments:

It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.

and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery

to this than the things that  I had made in rectangles.

70

okay, well that's a part of you,
好吧，这是你的一部分，

but how do I put all of you inside of the frame?

So now I've got you inside of the frame,

and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions

to this work than the previous one.

80
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.050
But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent?

81
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.307
And a frame is just a window.

82
00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.386
I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema --

they're these windows into  these other worlds.

in the world, inhabiting the world.

So that leads me back to virtual reality.

Let's talk about virtual reality.
下面我们说一下虚拟现实。

90
00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:25.754
Unfortunately,
不幸的是，

talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture.

So, it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain?
这个很难解释。为什么这么说呢？

95
00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:46.602
It's difficult because it's a very  experiential medium.

You feel your way inside of it.

It's a machine, but inside of it,

it feels like real life, it feels like truth.

that we capture when we shoot virtual reality.

This is a camera system that we built

我们基本上是打造了你居住的一个球形的世界。
