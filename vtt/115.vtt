00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.424
So it all came to life
这一切都是

2
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.280
in a dark bar in Madrid.
在马德里的一个黑暗的酒吧里发生的。

3
00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:21.067
I encountered my colleague from McGill, Michael Meaney.
我遇到了麦吉尔大学的同事，迈克尔·梅尼。

4
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.396
And we were drinking a few beers,

5
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.473
and like scientists do,

6
00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:26.943
he told me about his work.
他跟我聊他的工作。

7
00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:35.078
And he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups
他告诉我，他感兴趣的是

8
00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:37.172
after they were born.
小鼠出生后，母鼠如何舔它们的婴儿。

9
00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.895
And I was sitting there and saying,
我呆住了，说：

10
00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:42.919
"This is where my tax dollars are wasted --
“我交的税就浪费在这儿了啊，——

11
00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:43.977
(Laughter)
（笑声）

12
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.345

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:50.152
And he started telling me
他开始给我讲，

14
00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:53.576
that the rats, like humans,

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.046
lick their pups in very different ways.
用不同的方式舔抚她们的孩子。

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.805
Some mothers do a lot of that,
一些母亲做的很多，

17
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.034
some mothers do very little,

19
00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:05.588
But what's interesting about it
但是有趣的是，

20
00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:10.530
is when he follows these pups when they become adults --
当他跟踪这些小鼠直到成年——

21
00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:14.733
like, years in human life, long after their mother died.
相当于人类的很多年后， 母亲去世后的很长时间。

22
00:01:14.757 --> 00:01:16.825
They are completely different animals.
它们变成了完全不同的动物。

23
00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:21.222
The animals that were licked and groomed heavily,
那些受到大量舔舐和梳毛的动物，

24
00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:22.998
the high-licking and grooming,
即高舔舐和梳毛的动物，

25
00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.243
are not stressed.
不会紧张不安。

26
00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:28.091
They have different sexual behavior.

28
00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:36.574
than those that were not treated as intensively by their mothers.

29
00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:40.918
So then I was thinking to myself:
那么我问自己：

30
00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:42.234
Is this magic?
这是魔法吗？

31
00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:44.191
How does this work?
怎么会这样的？

32
00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:46.424
As geneticists would like you to think,
遗传学家希望你这样想：

33
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.182
perhaps the mother had the "bad mother" gene
也许那些妈妈拥有“坏妈妈”基因，

34
00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:54.687
that caused her pups to be stressful,
导致她的婴儿紧张不安，

35
00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:57.414
and then it was passed from generation to generation;
然后这种基因代代相传；

36
00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:00.138
it's all determined by genetics.
全部是遗传决定的。

37
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.656
Or is it possible that something else is going on here?
有没有别的可能？

38
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.251
In rats, we can ask this question and answer it.
在老鼠身上，我们可以 提出这个问题并解答它。

39
00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.880
So what we did is a cross-fostering experiment.
所以我们做了交叉养育实验。

40
00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:15.659
You essentially separate the litter, the babies of this rat, at birth,
基本上在一窝小鼠出生时 把它们分开，

41
00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:17.550
to two kinds of fostering mothers --

42
00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.902
not the real mothers, but mothers that will take care of them:
不是生母，而是照顾小鼠的母鼠：

43
00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:23.180
high-licking mothers and low-licking mothers.
高舔舐母鼠和低舔舐母鼠。

44
00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:27.082
And you can do the opposite with the low-licking pups.
另外一边是低舔舐小鼠。

45
00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:29.901
And the remarkable answer was,
令人惊奇的答案是，

46
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.964
it wasn't important what gene you got from your mother.
从母亲那里得到什么基因并不重要。

47
00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:39.736
It was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats.
定义这些老鼠的这种特征的不是生母，

48
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.766
It is the mother that took care of the pups.
而是照顾小鼠的母鼠。

49
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:47.416
So how can this work?
那么，这是怎么实现的？

50
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.544
I am an a epigeneticist.
我是一个表观遗传学家。

51
00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:54.240
I am interested in how genes are marked

52
00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:55.434
by a chemical mark
我们在母体子宫里时，

53
00:02:55.434 --> 00:03:00.283
during embryogenesis, during the time we're in the womb of our mothers,

54
00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.312
and decide which gene will be expressed

55
00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:04.482
in what tissue.

57
00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:12.377
And we thought: Is it possible

58
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:19.348
that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring
妈妈通过自己的行为

59
00:03:15.422 --> 00:03:20.435
through her behavior?

60
00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.556
And we spent 10 years,

61
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.621
and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events

63
00:03:29.822 --> 00:03:32.559
is translated to biochemical signals

71
00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:55.010
where all I have to do is behave well and proper,

72
00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:58.608
and that will gain me social acceptance?

73
00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:04.389
And now one can think about how important that process can be
现在可以想想这个过程

74
00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:05.462
for our lives.

75
00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.524
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.

76
00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:11.160
The DNA is old.
DNA历史悠久。

77
00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.252
It evolved during evolution.

78
00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:18.091
But it doesn't tell us if you are going to be born in Stockholm,
但它并不告诉我们，

79
00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:21.245
where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter,
你会出生在夏季白天长、 冬季白天短的斯德哥尔摩，

80
00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.830
or in Ecuador,

83
00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.545
So what we suggest is, perhaps what happens early in life,

84
00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.736
those signals that come through the mother,

90
00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:57.617
If there's no food around,

91
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.257
you'd better develop your brain to binge whenever you see a meal,

92
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:07.037
or store every piece of food that you have as fat.

93
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.069
So this is good.

94
00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:11.950
Evolution has selected this

But sometimes things can go wrong;
但有些事可能会出错：

98
00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:26.388
for example, if you're born to a poor family
例如，如果你出生在一个贫穷的家庭，

99
00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:29.341
and the signals are, "You better binge,

100
00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:32.580
you better eat every piece of food you're going to encounter."

101
00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:34.856
But now we humans and our brain have evolved,

102
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.976
have changed evolution even faster.

104
00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:46.798
And therefore, the preparation that we had by our mothers

105
00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:49.414
is turning out to be maladaptive.

106
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:54.384
The same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine

107
00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:56.865
is going to cause obesity,
却会导致肥胖症、

108
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.859
cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease.
心血管问题和代谢疾病。

109
00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:03.958
So this concept that genes could be marked by our experience,
所以，这个可以通过经历、 尤其是早期生活经历

110
00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:06.283
and especially the early life experience,
来标记基因的概念

111
00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:09.121
can provide us a unifying explanation
可以为我们提供

112
00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:11.488
of both health and disease.
对健康和疾病的统一解释。

113
00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.790
But is true only for rats?
但这只在老鼠身上才正确吗？

114
00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:17.766
The problem is, we cannot test this in humans,
问题是，我们不能用人类做测试，

115
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.902
because ethically, we cannot administer child adversity in a random way.
因为从道德上，我们不能 随机地为儿童设置逆境。

116
00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:25.230
So if a poor child develops a certain property,
所以，如果穷孩子养成某种特征，

117
00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:28.993
we don't know whether this is caused by poverty
我们不知道它是由贫穷引起的

118
00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:31.775
or whether poor people have bad genes.
还是因为穷人有不良的基因。

119
00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.980
So geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor
所以，遗传学家试图告诉你

120
00:06:34.534 --> 00:06:37.014
because their genes make them poor.
穷人之所以穷是因为基因让他们穷。

121
00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:39.044
Epigeneticists will tell you
表观遗传学家会告诉你

122
00:06:39.068 --> 00:06:43.178
poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment
穷人所在的不良环境或贫穷环境

123
00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:46.166
that creates that phenotype, that property.
环境创造了那些表型，那种贫穷。

124
00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:53.238
So we moved to look into our cousins, the monkeys.
所以我们转而观察我们的表亲：猴子。

125
00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:57.601
My colleague, Stephen Suomi, has been rearing monkeys
我的同事斯蒂芬·苏米

126
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:58.786
in two different ways:
以两种不同的方式饲养猴子：

127
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.711
randomly separated the monkey from the mother
随机地将猴子与母亲分离，

128
00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:04.327
and reared her with a nurse
通过护理员和代养条件

129
00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:07.310
and surrogate motherhood conditions.
来培养她。

130
00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:10.005
So these monkeys didn't have a mother; they had a nurse.
所以这些猴子没有妈妈， 只有护理员。

131
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.649
And other monkeys were reared with their normal, natural mothers.
而其他猴子是正常的亲生妈妈养育的。

132
00:07:14.673 --> 00:07:19.369
And when they were old, they were completely different animals.
当他们年老时，他们变成了完全不同的动物。

133
00:07:19.393 --> 00:07:22.486
The monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol,
有妈妈的猴子不嗜酒，

134
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.189
they were not sexually aggressive.
他们没有性暴力倾向。

135
00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:27.980
The monkeys that didn't have a mother were aggressive, were stressed
没有妈妈的猴子有攻击性，紧张，

136
00:07:27.684 --> 00:07:29.618
and were alcoholics.
还是酒鬼。

137
00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:35.784
So we looked at their DNA early after birth, to see:
我们在出生后的早期观察他们的DNA：

138
00:07:35.808 --> 00:07:38.575
Is it possible that the mother is marking?
看看有没有可能是妈妈在标记？

139
00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:43.957
Is there a signature of the mother in the DNA of the offspring?
后代的DNA里有没有妈妈的签名？

140
00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:46.233
These are Day-14 monkeys,
这些是14天的猴子，

141
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:50.333
and what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics.
这里看到的是我们研究 表观遗传学的现代方式。

142
00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:55.020
We can now map those chemical marks, which we call methylation marks,
我们能把这些化学标记—— 称为甲基化标记，

143
00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:58.286
on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.
以单核苷酸分辨率绘制到DNA上。

144
00:07:58.326 --> 00:08:00.203
We can map the entire genome.
我们能够绘制整个基因组。

145
00:08:00.227 --> 00:08:03.294
We can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not.
现在我们可以比较 有妈妈或没有妈妈的猴子了。

146
00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:05.272
And here's a visual presentation of this.
这里是直观展示。

147
00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:10.033
What you see is the genes that got more methylated are red.
你看到的是 较多甲基化的基因呈现红色。

148
00:08:09.997 --> 00:08:13.055
The genes that got less methylated are green.
较少甲基化的基因呈现绿色。

149
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:15.579
You can see many genes are changing,
你能看到很多基因在改变，

150
00:08:15.603 --> 00:08:18.317
because not having a mother is not just one thing --

151
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:19.872
it affects the whole way;

153
00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:25.161
when you become an adult.

155
00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:30.376
extremely well-separated from each other.
它们极其明显的大不相同。

156
00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:33.688
How early does this develop?

157
00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:36.111
These monkeys already didn't see their mothers,
这些猴子已经没见过妈妈，

158
00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:37.834
so they had a social experience.

159
00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:42.123
Do we sense our social status, even at the moment of birth?
我们在出生的时刻也能 感受自己的社会地位吗？

160
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:47.000
So in this experiment, we took placentas of monkeys
所以在这个实验中，

161
00:08:44.664 --> 00:08:49.118
that had different social status.
我们采用具有不同 社会地位的猴子的胎盘。

162
00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:54.892
What's interesting about social rank is that across all living beings,

163
00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:57.534
they will structure themselves by hierarchy.

169
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.526
is much healthier than monkey number four.
比四号猴子健康得多。

170
00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:18.400
And if you put them in a cage,
如果把它们放在一个笼子里，

171
00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:23.121
monkey number one will not eat as much.

172
00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:24.982
Monkey number four will eat [a lot].

173
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:30.222
And what you see here in this methylation mapping,
在这个甲基绘制图中可以看到，

174
00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:33.021
a dramatic separation at birth

175
00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.759
of the animals that had a high social status

178
00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:46.477
and that social information is not bad or good,

180
00:09:47.944 --> 00:09:52.185
because we have to program our biology differently

181
00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:55.290
if we are in the high or the low social status.

for 15 years.
跟踪调查了15年。

195
00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:40.631
And what happened was, that as the stress increased --
事实是，随着压力增大——

196
00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:43.263
and here we had objective measures of stress:
我们这里有对压力的客观度量：

197
00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:47.725
How long were you without power? Where did you spend your time?
你停电多长时间？在哪里度日？

198
00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:52.752
Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment or in some posh country home?
在婆婆的小公寓还是 奢侈的乡间别墅？

199
00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:55.434
So all of these added up to a social stress scale,

200
00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:56.840
and you can ask the question:

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.648
the children develop more autism,

00:11:10.607 --> 00:11:13.031
We would map the methylation state,

207
00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:18.527
and again, you see the green genes becoming red as stress increases,

211
00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:36.468
if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes,
如果我们不仅仅做我们基因历史的奴隶，

212
00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:39.120
that they could be programmed, can we deprogram them?
如果基因可以编写， 那我们能抹掉对基因的编写吗？

213
00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:44.495

00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:00.310
We first determined that the difference between these animals

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:16.175
to develop this addictive phenotype.
它们的基因组已经准备好 发展出成瘾表型。

246
00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:23.155
So we treated these animals with drugs that either increase DNA methylation,
然后我们用药治疗这些动物，

247
00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:25.367
which was the epigenetic marker to look at,

00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:28.910
or decrease epigenetic markings.
要么减少表观基因标记。

249
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:32.189
And we found that if we increased methylation,

250
00:13:32.213 --> 00:13:34.096
these animals go even crazier.
这些动物会更疯狂。

251

255
00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:47.155
And a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug
表观基因药物与其他药物

256
00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:48.485
and any other drug
的基本区别是，

257
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:50.681
is that with epigenetic drugs,
通过表观基因药物，

258
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:54.837
we essentially remove the signs of experience,
我们在根本上去除了经历的印记，

259
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:56.988
and once they're gone,
一旦去除印记，

260
00:13:56.952 --> 00:13:59.997
they will not come back unless you have the same experience.

The animal now is reprogrammed.
现在动物被重新编码。

262
00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:05.956
So when we visited the animals 30 days, 60 days later,
所以在30天、60天后—— 等于人类的很多年，

263
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.899
which is in human terms many years of life,
再造访这些动物时，

264
00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:14.229
they were still not addicted -- by a single epigenetic treatment.
它们仍然没有瘾—— 只通过单一的表观基因治疗。

265
00:14:16.292 --> 00:14:19.563
So what did we learn about DNA?

273
00:14:42.692 --> 00:14:48.587
And so you have, in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics,
因此，尽管遗传学具有确定性，

274
00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:52.284
you have control of the way your genes look,
你仍可以控制基因的表达方式，

275
00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:55.594
and this has a tremendous optimistic message

276
00:14:55.618 --> 00:14:59.126
for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases
例如癌症、心理疾病等

looking at them as maladaptation.
可以把这些疾病看作适应不良。

280
00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:10.662
And if we can epigenetically intervene,

281
00:15:10.686 --> 00:15:14.182
[we can] reverse the movie by removing an actor
我们就可以去掉一个演员，让电影倒退

282
00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:17.063
and setting up a new narrative.
并设置新的故事线。

283
00:15:17.848 --> 00:15:20.345
So what I told you today is,
所以我今天告诉你的是，

284
00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:25.461
our DNA is really combined of two components,
我们的DNA实际由两个部分组成，
