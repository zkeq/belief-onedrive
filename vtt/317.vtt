00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.100
Here's a question that matters.
这里有一个重要的问题。

2
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.676
[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]
【改造人体会出现道德问题吗】

3
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.196
Because we're beginning to get all the tools together to evolve ourselves.
因为我们已经开始拥有改造自身所需的所有工具了。

4
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.636
And we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants
我们可以改造细菌，我们可以改造植物，

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.076
and we can evolve animals,
我们也可以改造动物，

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.916
and we're now reaching a point where we really have to ask,
我们现在已经到了必须要问这个问题的时候了，

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.780
is it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings?
这是否会导致道德问题，或者我们是否想要改造人类？

8
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.156
And as you're thinking about that,
在你们思考这个问题的时候，

9
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.916
let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics,
让我就假肢为例子和你们谈谈这件事，

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.620
prosthetics past, present, future.
假肢的过去，现在和未来。

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.316
So this is the iron hand
这是一只铁制手臂，

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.676
that belonged to one of the German counts.
它属于一位德国伯爵。

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.116
Loved to fight, lost his arm in one of these battles.
嗜爱战争的他，在一场战役中失去了他的手臂。

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.596
No problem, he just made a suit of armor,
不过也不是问题，他做了一套战服，

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.956
put it on,
穿上它，

16
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.236
perfect prosthetic.
就拥有了完美的假肢。

17
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.180
That's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from.
这就是术语“铁拳执政”的来源。

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.876
And of course these prosthetics have been getting more and more useful,
当然，这些假肢变得越来越实用，

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.156
more and more modern.
越来越现代化。

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630
You can hold soft-boiled eggs.
你可以用它拿像水煮蛋这样柔软的东西。

21
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.156
You can have all types of controls, and as you're thinking about that,
你可以做出各种控制，当你们思考这件事的时候，

22
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.196
there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr
像修米･赫尔这样神奇的人

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.059
who have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.
就做出了绝对不可思议的假肢。

24
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.356
So the wonderful Aimee Mullins will go out and say,
这就让伟大的艾米·穆林斯（残奥会短跑冠军）能走出家门说，

25
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.060
how tall do I want to be tonight?
今晚我要什么身高，戴哪副假肢呢？

26
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.756
Or Hugh will say what type of cliff do I want to climb?
或者她会说：我今天应该爬哪种岩壁？

27
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.276
Or does somebody want to run a marathon, or does somebody want to ballroom dance?
亦或者，有人想去跑个马拉松，或是参加交际舞会吗？

28
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.276
And as you adapt these things,
当你适应了这些事情的时候，

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.436
the interesting thing about prosthetics is they've been coming inside the body.
有趣的是，现在的假肢都已经能来自体内了。

30
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.436
So these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees.
所以这些外部假肢就变成了人造膝盖，

31
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.516
They've become artificial hips.
变成了人造髋关节。

32
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.756
And then they've evolved further
然后它们又更进一步的发展了，

33
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.796
to become not just nice to have
不再只是锦上添花的东西，

34
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.020
but essential to have.
而是至关重要的部分。

35
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.596
So when you're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,
当你把一个心脏起搏器当成假肢时，

36
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.316
you're talking about something that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg,"
那你就不仅仅是在说，“我缺条腿”这么简单，

37
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.756
it's, "if I don't have this, I can die."
而是“如果我没有这个，我就会死掉。”

38
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.876
And at that point, a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic relationship
在那种程度上，假肢与人体就形成了

39
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.100
with the human body.
一种共生关系。

40
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.916
And four of the smartest people that I've ever met --
而四个我见过的最聪明的人——

41
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.196
Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr, Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander --
艾德·鲍登，修米･赫尔，乔･雅各布森，鲍勃･兰登——

42
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.796
are working on a Center for Extreme Bionics.
他们都在一家极致仿生中心工作。

43
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.436
And the interesting thing of what you're seeing here is
而你们现在看到的一件有趣的事情是，

44
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.876
these prosthetics now get integrated into the bone.
这些假肢已经能融入人体骨骼当中，

45
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.555
They get integrated into the skin.
能融入皮肤之中，

46
00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.295
They get integrated into the muscle.
也能融入肌肉组织之中。

47
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.156
And one of the other sides of Ed
而另一方面，艾德也开始

48
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.076
is he's been thinking about how to connect the brain
思考如何使用灯光或其他机制

49
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.796
using light or other mechanisms
使大脑能够直接和

50
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.100
directly to things like these prosthetics.
假肢类的东西相联结。

51
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.596
And if you can do that,
如果我们能做到那一点，

52
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.820
then you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity.
那么我们就可以改变人类的基本组成部分了。

53
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.660
So how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve.
你对于一个事物的反应速度是由神经元直径决定的。

54
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.620
And of course, if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic,
但是当然，如果你的神经是外缘的，或是假肢，

55
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.300
say with light or liquid metal,
举个例子，光线或是液态金属，

56
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.796
then you can increase that diameter
那么你们就能增宽神经元的直径，

57
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.876
and you could even increase it theoretically to the point where,
从理论上来说，我们甚至可以提升反应速度，

58
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.940
as long as you could see the muzzle flash, you could step out of the way of a bullet.
快到只要能看见枪口的闪光，就能躲开子弹。

59
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.780
Those are the order of magnitude of changes you're talking about.
这些就是我们准备讨论的变化的级别。

60
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.596
This is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics.
这是假肢的第四种境界。

61
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.156
These are Phonak hearing aids,
这是一些峰力助听器，

62
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.236
and the reason why these are so interesting
这些东西很有趣，

63
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.726
is because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something
原因是它们已经跨越了假肢是

64
00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:21.389
for somebody who is "disabled"
帮助“障碍人群”的门槛了。

65
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.436
and they become something that somebody who is "normal"
它们变成了“正常人群”

66
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.356
might want to actually have,
也想要的东西，

67
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.356
because what this prosthetic does, which is really interesting,
因为这种假肢所能做的，非常有趣，

68
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.360
is not only does it help you hear,
不仅仅能够帮助你听见声音，

69
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.700
you can focus your hearing,
还能帮助你专注于听，

70
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.140
so it can hear the conversation going on over there.
能帮你听见别处的声音。

71
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.156
You can have superhearing.
这样你就有了顺风耳。

72
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.500
You can have hearing in 360 degrees. You can have white noise.
你可以听到全方位的声音。你可以听见白噪声。

73
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.990
You can record, and oh, by the way, they also put a phone into this.
你可以录音，顺便提一下，它们还可以承载手机功能。

74
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.650
So this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone.
所以它的功能不仅是助听，还可以成为你的手机。

75
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.900
And at that point, somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.
到了那时，就会有人自愿去安装假肢了。

76
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.140
All of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together,
这些成千的连接疏松的碎片正在聚集起来，

77
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.876
and it's about time we ask the question,
是时候让我们提出疑问，

78
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.060
how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two?
我们在下一个，或者两个世纪打算如何改造人类？

79
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.500
And for that we turn to a great philosopher
我们向一个伟大的哲学家求助，

80
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.796
who was a very smart man despite being a Yankee fan.
他是非常聪明的人，尽管是洋基队的粉丝。

81
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.700
(Laughter)
（笑声）

82
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.436
And Yogi Berra used to say, of course, that it's very tough to make predictions,
当然，就像约吉·贝拉说过的那样，预测不是一件简单的事情，

83
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.836
especially about the future.
特别是关于未来的预测。

84
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.956
(Laughter)
（笑声）

85
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.036
So instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with,
所以说，我们开篇就先不预测未来，

86
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.230
let's take what's happening in the present with people like Tony Atala,
让我们看看当下，发生在像托尼・阿塔拉这样的人身上的故事吧，

87
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.659
who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.
托尼身上有着30多个再设计过的器官。

88
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.300
And maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn't having something external, titanium.
也许最终版本的假肢已经不需要了，例如金属钛这种外缘材料。

89
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.316
Maybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code,
也许会来自你们自身的基因编码，

90
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.660
remake your own body parts,
重新制造身体的一部分，

91
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.340
because that's a whole lot more effective than any kind of a prosthetic.
因为那会比任何一种假肢效果都要好。

92
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.276
But while you're at it, then you can take the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.
当你们这么想的时候，就可以看看克雷格·文特尔和翰姆·史密斯的工作。

93
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.356
And one of the things that we've been doing
我们一直以来想要做的事情之一，

94
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.940
is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells.
就是想出如何重新编码细胞。

95
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.670
And if you can reprogram a cell,
如果你可以重新编码细胞，

96
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.940
then you can change the cells in those organs.
你就可以改变那些器官中的细胞。

97
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.200
So if you can change the cells in those organs,
因此，如果我们可以改变器官中的细胞，

98
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.956
maybe you make those organs more radiation-resistant.
也许我们就能使得那些细胞更加耐辐射；

99
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.876
Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.
也许能让它们吸收更多氧气；

100
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.556
Maybe you make them more efficient
让它们更加高效的

101
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.060
to filter out stuff that you don't want in your body.
过滤人体所不需要的杂质。

102
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.916
And over the last few weeks, George Church has been in the news a lot
在过去的几周里，乔治·丘奇经常上新闻，

103
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.236
because he's been talking about taking one of these programmable cells
因为他一直都在描述一种可编码细胞，

104
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.220
and inserting an entire human genome into that cell.
以及将整个人类基因组插入那个细胞。

105
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.156
And once you can insert an entire human genome into a cell,
一旦我们能够将整个人类基因组插入那个细胞当中，

106
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.276
then you begin to ask the question,
我们就会开始问这样的问题：

107
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.980
would you want to enhance any of that genome?
你们想要加强基因中的任何部分吗？

108
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.626
Do you want to enhance a human body?
你们想要强化人体吗？

109
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.916
How would you want to enhance a human body?
你们想要怎样强化人体？

110
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.036
Where is it ethical to enhance a human body
怎样强化是合乎道德的？

111
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.316
and where is it not ethical to enhance a human body?
而怎样又是不合乎道德的？

112
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.236
And all of a sudden, what we're doing
突然之间，我们正在做的，

113
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.196
is we've got this multidimensional chess board
仿佛是得到了一个多维棋盘：

114
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.476
where we can change human genetics by using viruses
我们可以通过病毒来改变人类的基因，

115
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.940
to attack things like AIDS,
从而攻克艾滋这样的疾病，

116
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.356
or we can change the gene code through gene therapy
或者我们也可以通过改变基因序列，基因疗法，

117
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.316
to do away with some hereditary diseases,
来对付遗传性疾病，

118
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.956
or we can change the environment,
又或者说，我们 可以改变我们的环境，

119
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.647
and change the expression of those genes in the epigenome
我们还可以改变显性基因的基因表达，

120
00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:05.631
and pass that on to the next generations.
将表象传递给下一代人。

121
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.250
And all of a sudden, it's not just one little bit,
一瞬之间，就变得不止是一点点了，

122
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.156
it's all these stacked little bits
这些一点点累积起来，

123
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.260
that allow you to take little portions of it
每次拿走一点点，

124
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.100
until all the portions coming together
直到它们汇集起来，

125
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.060
lead you to something that's very different.
让你变得完全不同。

126
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.156
And a lot of people are very scared by this stuff.
很多人对此感到害怕。

127
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.100
And it does sound scary, and there are risks to this stuff.
这听起来确实很恐怖，也很有风险。

128
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.556
So why in the world would you ever want to do this stuff?
那么我们到底为什么想要这么做呢？

129
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.596
Why would we really want to alter the human body
为什么我们希望彻底的

130
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.820
in a fundamental way?
改变人体呢？

131
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.156
The answer lies in part
英国皇家天文协会的洛德・里斯

132
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.010
with Lord Rees, astronomer royal of Great Britain.
给我们提供了部分答案。

133
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.196
And one of his favorite sayings is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.
他最喜欢说的一句话就是：宇宙是百分之百邪恶的。

134
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.436
So what does that mean?
这是什么意思呢？

135
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.356
It means if you take any one of your bodies at random,
意思就是，随机取下你身体的一部分

136
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.276
drop it anywhere in the universe,
扔在宇宙的任何地方，

137
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.020
drop it in space, you die.
扔在太空，你就死定了。

138
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.916
Drop it on the Sun, you die.
扔在太阳上，死定了。

139
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.956
Drop it on the surface of Mercury, you die.
扔在水星表面上，死定了。

140
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.620
Drop it near a supernova, you die.
扔在超新星附近，死定了。

141
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.180
But fortunately, it's only about 80 percent effective.
但幸运的是，这句话只有80%是正确的。

142
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.500
So as a great physicist once said,
一位伟大的物理学家曾说过，

143
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.956
there's these little upstream eddies of biology
就是那些处于上游的小生物漩涡，

144
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.620
that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy.
创造了汹涌洪流当中的秩序。

145
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.876
So as the universe dissipates energy,
所以随着宇宙不断耗散能量，

146
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.380
there's these upstream eddies that create biological order.
这些处于上游的小型生命漩涡，创造了生物界的秩序。

147
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.716
Now, the problem with eddies is, they tend to disappear.
现在，关于小漩涡的问题就是它们要消失了。

148
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.620
They shift. They move in rivers.
它们会在星河中移动。

149
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.476
And because of that, when an eddy shifts,
因为这样的原因，当小漩涡移动的时候，

150
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.036
when the Earth becomes a snowball, when the Earth becomes very hot,
当地球变成雪球的时候，变得炙热的时候，

151
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.316
when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, when you have supervolcanoes,
当地球被小行星击中的时候，当我们遇到超级火山爆发的时候，

152
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.196
when you have solar flares,
当我们遇到太阳耀斑爆发的时候，

153
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.556
when you have potentially extinction-level events
当我们遇到潜在的毁灭级事件的时候，

154
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.796
like the next election --
比如下届选举这种事——

155
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.980
(Laughter)
（笑声）

156
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.500
then all of a sudden, you can have periodic extinctions.
然后突然之间，我们就会遇到周期性的大灭绝。

157
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.660
And by the way, that's happened five times on Earth,
顺便提一下，这已经在地球上上演过五次了。

158
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.276
and therefore it is very likely
因此，人类有朝一日

159
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.340
that the human species on Earth is going to go extinct someday.
在地球上灭绝是非常可能发生的。

160
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.756
Not next week,
不是下个星期，

161
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.596
not next month,
不是下个月，

162
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.500
maybe in November, but maybe 10,000 years after that.
也许就是11月，但也许是那之后的一万年。

163
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.516
As you're thinking of the consequence of that,
想象一下那样的结果，

164
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.956
if you believe that extinctions are common and natural
如果你相信大灭绝是平常的，自然的，

165
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.276
and normal and occur periodically,
会周期性发生，

166
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.180
it becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species.
这就成为了一个使我们的物种多样化的道德准则。

167
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.956
And it becomes a moral imperative
之所以会成为道德准则，

168
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.956
because it's going to be really hard to live on Mars
是因为如果我们不彻底修改人体，

169
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.700
if we don't fundamentally modify the human body.
那么我们就很难在火星上生存。

170
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.916
Right?
不难理解吧？

171
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.276
You go from one cell,
我们都来自一个细胞，

172
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.516
mom and dad coming together to make one cell,
父母一起产生的一个细胞，

173
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.716
in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.
通过连续分裂产生了10兆个细胞。

174
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.196
We don't know, if you change the gravity substantially,
我们不能确定彻底改变重力时，

175
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.700
if the same thing will happen to create your body.
相同的事情还会发生在我们体内。

176
00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:53.036
We do know that if you expose our bodies as they currently are
我们能确定的是现在将自己的身体

177
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.630
to a lot of radiation, we will die.
暴露在强辐射下，我们就会死。

178
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.916
So as you're thinking of that, you have to really redesign things
当你这样想的时候，就会发现仅仅是为了去火星，

179
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.196
just to get to Mars.
我们就必须重新编码自己。

180
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.140
Forget about the moons of Neptune or Jupiter.
更不用说去海王星或木星的卫星了。

181
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.276
And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,
借用一下尼古拉·卡尔达肖夫（前苏联天体物理学家）的话，

182
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.476
let's think about life in a series of scales.
让我们在一系列的尺度上考虑一下生命。

183
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.996
So Life One civilization
在一级生命文明当中

184
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.670
is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks.
可以开始改变人类的长相。

185
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.196
And we've been doing that for thousands of years.
我们已经这样做了数千年了。

186
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.380
You've got tummy tucks and you've got this and you've got that.
你可以做腹部整形，整整这儿，整整那儿。

187
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.516
You alter your looks, and I'm told
你能改变你的长相，我听人说

188
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.860
that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons.
不是所有改变的背后都有医疗缘由。

189
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.556
(Laughter)
（笑声）

190
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.780
Seems odd.
看起来很奇怪。

191
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.700
A Life Two civilization is a different civilization.
二级生命文明就是完全不同的了。

192
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.700
A Life Two civilization alters fundamental aspects of the body.
二级生命文明就开始改变人体的基本特征了。

193
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.516
So you put human growth hormone in, the person grows taller,
所以你可以注射生长激素，使人长的更高，

194
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.476
or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism
或者使用某种药物，使人变胖，新陈代谢失调，

195
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.116
or does a whole series of things,
或者发生一系列的改变。

196
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.836
but you're altering the functions in a fundamental way.
但是你已经彻底改变了基础机能了。

197
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.476
To become an intrasolar civilization,
要成为整个太阳系内文明，

198
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.220
we're going to have to create a Life Three civilization,
我们必须要经历三级生命文明，

199
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.140
and that looks very different from what we've got here.
而且明显有别于所提到的二级文明。

200
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.876
Maybe you splice in Deinococcus radiodurans
也许你会被植入耐辐射球菌，

201
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.020
so that the cells can resplice after a lot of exposure to radiation.
这样在大量暴露于辐射后受损的细胞仍能复原。

202
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.156
Maybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood
也许你就会将氧气直接吸入血液当中

203
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.620
instead of through your lungs.
而不是肺中。

204
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.140
But you're talking about really radical redesigns,
但是我们正在讨论的是完全彻底的重设，

205
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.516
and one of the interesting things that's happened in the last decade
在过去十年间发生了一件有趣的事情，

206
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.276
is we've discovered a whole lot of planets out there.
那就是我们在宇宙间发现了更多的行星。

207
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.980
And some of them may be Earth-like.
其中的很多都属于类地行星。

208
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.876
The problem is, if we ever want to get to these planets,
问题在于，如果我们想要到达那些行星，

209
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.556
the fastest human objects --
人类拥有的的最快物体——

210
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.156
Juno and Voyager and the rest of this stuff --
朱诺和旅行者，还有剩下类似的东西——

211
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.676
take tens of thousands of years
将花费我们数千万年，

212
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.820
to get from here to the nearest solar system.
才能从这里到达离我们最近的恒星系。

213
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.500
So if you want to start exploring beaches somewhere else,
所以，如果我们想在其他地方漫步沙滩，

214
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.620
or you want to see two-sun sunsets,
或者想要看双日落，

215
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.796
then you're talking about something that is very different,
那么我们在讨论的一定是非常不同的东西，

216
00:10:52.820 --> 00:11:00.820
because you have to change the timescale and the body of humans in ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable.
因为我们必须要改变时间维度和人体的构造直到超乎想象的地步。

217
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.660
And that's a Life Four civilization.
那就是四级生命文明。

218
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.476
Now, we can't even begin to imagine what that might look like,
现在，虽然我们无法想象我们会变成什么样，

219
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.836
but we're beginning to get glimpses
但是我们已经能看到

220
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.220
of instruments that might take us even that far.
能把我们带到那里的一些尖端设备了。

221
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.396
And let me give you two examples.
我给你们举两个例子。

222
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.373
So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,
这就是我们出色的弗洛伊德・瑞姆斯伯格，（另一位TEDMED演讲者）

223
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.156
and one of the things that Floyd's been doing
弗洛伊德一直在做的事情之一就是

224
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.170
is he's been playing with the basic chemistry of life.
研究基础生命化学。

225
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.596
So all life on this planet is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.
地球上的所有生命都由ATCG组成，DNA链中的四个结构单元。

226
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.756
All bacteria, all plants, all animals, all humans, all cows,
所有的细菌，植物，动物，人类，奶牛，

227
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.980
everything else.
所有的生物。

228
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.436
And what Floyd did is he changed out two of those base pairs,
弗洛伊德做的就是改变了其中的两组碱基对，

229
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.980
so it's ATXY.
就变成了ATXY组合。

230
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:47.276
And that means that you now have a parallel system to make life,
这就意味着，你现在拥有了一个制造生命的平行体系，

231
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.596
to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,
去产生幼儿，去繁殖，去进化，

232
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.796
that doesn't mate with most things on Earth
不能与地球上的大多数生命配对，

233
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.700
or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.
或者说事实上全都不能。

234
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.236
Maybe you make plants that are immune to all bacteria.
也许你能够制造出对所有细菌免疫的植物。

235
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.756
Maybe you make plants that are immune to all viruses.
也许你能制造出对所有病毒免疫的植物。

236
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.316
But why is that so interesting?
但是，这为什么有趣呢？

237
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.500
It means that we are not a unique solution.
因为这就意味着，我们不只有唯一的解决方案了。

238
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.956
It means you can create alternate chemistries to us
这就意味着，我们能够造出不同于我们的化学生物，

239
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.796
that could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet
它们能够适应不同星球上的生活，

240
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.180
that could create life and heredity.
它们能创造生命，繁衍生息。

241
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.180
The second experiment,
第二个实验，

242
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.380
or the other implication of this experiment,
或者说是这个实验的另一个运用，

243
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.396
is that all of you, all life is based on 20 amino acids.
就是我们所有人，所有的生命都基于20种氨基酸。

244
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.876
If you don't substitute two amino acids,
如果我们并不是去替换其中的两种，

245
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.476
if you don't say ATXY, if you say ATCG + XY,
我们不用ATXY的模式，我们用ATCG＋XY的模式，

246
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.260
then you go from 20 building blocks to 172,
我们就能够从20种基础氨基酸增长到172种，

247
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.476
and all of a sudden you've got 172 building blocks of amino acids
转瞬间，我们就有了172种基础氨基酸的模型

248
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.300
to build life-forms in very different shapes.
去建造完全不同的生命形式。

249
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.356
The second experiment to think about is a really weird experiment
第二个实验，是在中国做的

250
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.460
that's been taking place in China.
一个非常诡异的实验。

251
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.780
So this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads.
这个家伙已经换植过上百只老鼠的头了。

252
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.116
Right?
听上去怎么样？

253
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.220
And why is that an interesting experiment?
为什么这个实验很有趣呢？

254
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.316
Well, think of the first heart transplants.
想一想第一场心脏移植手术。

255
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.956
One of the things they used to do
他人们以前经常做的一件事

256
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.516
is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor
就是会把器官捐赠者的妻子或女儿带过来，

257
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.436
so the donee could tell the doctors,
这样被捐赠者就可以回答医生的问题，

258
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.076
"Do you recognize this person? Do you love this person?
“你认识这个人吗？你爱她吗？

259
00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:20.896
Do you feel anything for this person?"
你看到她能感觉到什么吗？”

260
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.460
We laugh about that today.
今天，我们当然会把这当笑话讲。

261
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.596
We laugh because we know the heart is a muscle,
我们笑是因为我们知道心脏只是一块肌肉，

262
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.116
but for hundreds of thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years,
但是，在历史上的若干年间，

263
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.036
"I gave her my heart. She took my heart. She broke my heart."
“我把心献给了她。她勾走了我的心。让我心碎。”

264
00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.466
We thought this was emotion
我们都把心脏当成感情的来源，

265
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.700
and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart. Nope.
我们以为感情会与心相随，一同被移植。不是这样的。

266
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.300
So how about the brain?
但是如果换成大脑呢？

267
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.940
Two possible outcomes to this experiment.
有两种可能的结局。

268
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.116
If you can get a mouse
如果你能成功得到

269
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.846
that is functional,
一只活着的老鼠，

270
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.980
then you can see,
你会观察到，

271
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.460
is the new brain a blank slate?
它的新大脑是否是一片空白？

272
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.140
And boy, does that have implications.
甚至，这个大脑是不是有同样的功能？

273
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.140
Second option:
第二种可能：

274
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.740
the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.
新的老鼠还记得它的恋爱对象。

275
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.676
The new mouse remembers what it's afraid of,
新的老鼠还记得它害怕什么，

276
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.396
remembers how to navigate the maze,
记得迷宫的线路，

277
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.620
and if that is true,
如果这是真的，

278
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.180
then you can transplant memory and consciousness.
我们就能够移植我们的记忆和意识。

279
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.316
And then the really interesting question is,
然后就引发了一个有趣的问题，

280
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.276
if you can transplant this, is the only input-output mechanism
移植大脑的过程，是否是对于下半身唯一的

281
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.500
this down here?
输入输出信号的控制呢？

282
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.956
Or could you transplant that consciousness into something
或者说，我们能否将意识转入一个

283
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.956
that would be very different,
十分不同的东西里，

284
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.236
that would last in space,
使它能够在宇宙中长远留存，

285
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.316
that would last tens of thousands of years,
能够持续数万年，

286
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.340
that would be a completely redesigned body
这是身体的完全重设，

287
00:14:31.364 --> 00:14:35.044
that could hold consciousness for a long, long period of time?
使我们的意识能够存在很长，很长一段时间？

288
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.900
And let's come back to the first question:
那么，让我们重新回到开始的问题：

289
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.260
Why would you ever want to do that?
为什么我们会想要那么做？

290
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.396
Well, I'll tell you why.
好吧，让我来告诉你们原因。

291
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.140
Because this is the ultimate selfie.
因为这就是我们的终极自拍照。

292
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.620
(Laughter)
（笑声）

293
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.820
This is taken from six billion miles away,
这将来自六十亿英里以外，

294
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.060
and that's Earth.
那就是地球。

295
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.820
And that's all of us.
里面包括我们所有人。

296
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.580
And if that little thing goes, all of humanity goes.
如果那个小东西能够持续下去，整个人类就会存活下去。

297
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.356
And the reason you want to alter the human body
我们之所以想要改变人体，

298
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.156
is because you eventually want a picture that says,
是因为我们最终想要 一张照片，上面写着，

299
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.116
that's us, and that's us,
这是我们，这是我们，

300
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.556
and that's us,
这也是我们，

301
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.700
because that's the way humanity survives long-term extinction.
因为这让人类得以幸存于漫长的灭绝事件中。

302
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.516
And that's the reason why it turns out
这就是为什么结果表明，

303
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.476
it's actually unethical not to evolve the human body
不进化人体是不道德的。

304
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.836
even though it can be scary, even though it can be challenging,
即使那可能很可怕，即使可能很困难，

305
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.236
but it's what's going to allow us to explore, live
但这会使我们能够去探索，生存，

306
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.780
and get to places we can't even dream of today,
到达当今无法想象的地方，

307
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.316
but which our great-great-great-great- grandchildren might someday.
也许我们的曾曾曾曾孙辈有朝一日会实现这个目标。

308
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.556
Thank you very much.
非常感谢。

309
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:44.100
