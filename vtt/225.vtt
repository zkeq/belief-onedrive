it's crucial that young people understand the ground rules for consent,

are educating our kids for us.

and yes, enjoyably,

She then proceeded to describe her sex life to me:

46
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.715
I should probably say right up top that despite the hype,

when we label that as "not sex,"
如果认为这些新行为“不是性行为”，

52
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.860
that opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect.

53
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.396
That's particularly true of oral sex,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.316
which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse.

Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal,"

like they'd all read the same instruction manual --

at least if boys were on the receiving end.

it was a way to boost social status.

62
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.436
As a freshman at a West Coast college said to me,

"A girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night

because she doesn't want to have sex with him,

and I don't want anything to happen ... "

I heard so many stories of girls performing one-sided oral sex

69
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.716
that I started asking,
我不禁要问，

70
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.996
"What if every time you were alone with a guy,

71
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.996
he told you to get him a glass of water from the kitchen,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.780
You wouldn't stand for it.
你能受得了吗？

77
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.396
But it wasn't always that boys didn't want to.
但话说回来，有时候并不是男孩不想。

78
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.076
It was that girls didn't want them to.

Girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals.

and more than half do so regularly.

93
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.876

94
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.916
if this was how they would choose to spend their time.

95
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.476
(Laughter)

96
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.916

I trust I don't have to tell you

The labiaplasty trend has become so worrisome

129
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.516
that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

the number of girls involved is still quite small,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.076
but you could see them as canaries in a coal mine,

telling us something important about the way girls see their bodies.

a psychologist at the University of Michigan,

"Intimate justice."

145
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.276

And how does each partner define "good enough"?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.660
that can be deceptive.

that's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment.

190
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.036
Listening to all of this and thinking about it,

191

I began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological clitoridectomy
我意识到我们可能对美国女孩

192
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.620

196
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.276
Parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees,

197
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.756
and they leave this whole situation in here unnamed.

There's no better way to make something unspeakable

Then kids go into their puberty education classes

periods and unwanted pregnancy.

206
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.436
you know, the one that looks kind of like a steer head --

And it always grays out between the legs.
双腿之间的部分永远都是灰色。

209
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.756

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.156
we certainly never say clitoris.
也从不说阴蒂。

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.396
No surprise,

fewer than half of teenage girls age 14 to 17

And then they go into their partnered experience

215
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.716
and we expect that somehow they'll think sex is about them,

221
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.756

Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me

as the definition of virginity.

229
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.396
Not because intercourse isn't a big deal,

230
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.796
but it's worth questioning why we consider this one act,

231
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.636
which most girls associate with discomfort or pain,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.420
so much more transformative than anything else.
远比此有蜕变性。

235
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.916
And it's worth considering how this is serving girls;

244
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.620
So I asked a gay girl that I met,

253
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.580
whoa.
哇哦。

254
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.596
What if just for a second
我们是不是从没想过，

255
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.980
we imagined that was the definition?

256
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.716
Again, not because intercourse isn't a big deal --

but it isn't the only big deal,

and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal,

260
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.076
this helps us reconceptualize it as a pool of experiences

269
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.636
The only way that shift in thinking can happen though
