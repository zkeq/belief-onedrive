where men live as long as women.

The other 75 percent is lifestyle.

where I went to investigate this,

It means that the villagers' lives constantly intersect.

42
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.836
And as I walked through the village,

I could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me

Villagrande couldn't have survived

Urban priorities changed as we moved towards the industrial revolution

147
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.396
how often they went to the doctor,
多久去一次医院，

148
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.916
whether they smoked or drank, etc.

149
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.156
She recorded all of this
她把这些都记录了下来

150
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.756
and then she and her colleagues sat tight and waited for seven years
然后她和她的同事就静静的等了七年

151
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.500
to see who would still be breathing.
观察七年后哪些人还健在。

152
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.700

153
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.700
what reduced their chances of dying the most?

154
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.876
That was her question.
这就是她提出的问题。

155
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.436
So let's now look at her data in summary,
我们来简要地看看她收集的数据

156
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.196
going from the least powerful predictor to the strongest.
从影响最低的到最高的。

157
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.436
OK?
好吗？

158
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.716
So clean air, which is great,
首先是干净的空气，很棒。

159
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.780
it doesn't predict how long you will live.
但是它并不会预测你的寿命。

160
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.556
Whether you have your hypertension treated
其次是否治疗了高血压，

161
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.916
is good.
挺好，

162
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.716
Still not a strong predictor.
但也不是一个重要因素。

163
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.236
Whether you're lean or overweight, you can stop feeling guilty about this,
是胖是瘦， 你们都可以不用有罪恶感了，

164
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.636
because it's only in third place.
这只排到倒数第三呢。

165
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.156
How much exercise you get is next,
接下来是你锻炼了多少，

166
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.516
still only a moderate predictor.
但这也只是一个中等的影响因素。

167
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.276
Whether you've had a cardiac event and you're in rehab and exercising,
你是否心脏出现过问题， 现在在恢复期和锻炼着

168
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.836
getting higher now.

169
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.476
Whether you've had a flu vaccine.
接下来是你是否注射过流感疫苗。

170
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.756
Did anybody here know
在座的有人知道

171
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.580
that having a flu vaccine protects you more than doing exercise?
接种流感疫苗其实比锻炼 更能保护我们的身体吗？

172
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.036
Whether you were drinking and quit,
然后是，你是否酗酒然后戒掉了

173
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.036
or whether you're a moderate drinker,

174
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.540
whether you don't smoke, or if you did, whether you quit,
然后，吸烟否，如果吸烟， 那么你是否戒掉了，

175
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.996
and getting towards the top predictors
马上到影响最大的因素了：

176
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.556
are two features of your social life.
这就是你社交生活的两大特点。

177
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.956
First, your close relationships.
第一，就是你亲近的关系。

178
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.276
These are the people that you can call on for a loan

179
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.916
if you need money suddenly,

185
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:49.396
are a strong predictor, if you have them, of how long you'll live.
如果你拥有了的话， 将是你能活多久的最大的影响因子。

186
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.756
And then something that surprised me,
接下来的因素，让我觉得很震惊，

187
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.396
something that's called social integration.
它就是所谓的社会融合。

188
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.476
This means how much you interact with people
意思就是你在每天的生活中

189
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.900
as you move through your day.
与人们有着多少互动。

191
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.276
And these mean both your weak and your strong bonds,
这些同时意味着你的 或生疏或熟络的人脉。

192
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.796
so not just the people you're really close to,

193
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.196
who mean a lot to you,
对你有着不同寻常的意义的人们。

194
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.756
but, like, do you talk to the guy who every day makes you your coffee?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.036
Do you play bridge or poker, have a book club?

of how long you'll live.
因素之一。

200
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.580
Now, this leads me to the next question:
这就引入了下一个问题：

201
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:36.076
if we now spend more time online than on any other activity,
如果我们在网上花费比 其他任何活动都多的时间，

202
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.756
including sleeping,

203
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.956
we're now up to 11 hours a day,
我们每天最多就睡11个小时

204
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.476
one hour more than last year, by the way,
顺便提一下，比去年多一个小时，

205
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.316
does it make a difference?
这会有所改变吗？

206
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.356
Why distinguish between interacting in person
怎么区分面对面的互动

207
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.596
and interacting via social media?
和通过社交平台与人们交谈呢？

208
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.476
Is it the same thing as being there
这两者是相同的吗？

209
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.180
if you're in contact constantly with your kids through text, for example?
比如你长期和你的孩子 通过短信保持联系。

210
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.156
Well, the short answer to the question is no,
事实上，简单来说： 不是

211
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.836
it's not the same thing.
这不能相提并论。

212
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.676
Face-to-face contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,
面对面的交谈会释放出 完整的级联神经递质

213
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.996
and like a vaccine, they protect you now in the present
就像疫苗，能立马保护你

214
00:10:09.682 --> 00:10:11.918
and well into the future.
也能保证在未来 你不会遭受病毒的侵扰。

215
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.420
So simply making eye contact with somebody,
所以哪怕只是简单的 与他人进行眼神交流,

216
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.996
shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five
握手，与某人击掌,

217
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.050
is enough to release oxytocin,
都足以让我们释放催产素，

218
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.316
which increases your level of trust
提高我们的信任水平，

219
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.180
and it lowers your cortisol levels.
降低皮质醇水平。

220
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.580
So it lowers your stress.
进而减少我们的压力。

221
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.076
And dopamine is generated, which gives us a little high
另外也会产生多巴胺， 给我们一种兴奋感

222
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.316
and it kills pain.
还可以止疼。

223
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.260
It's like a naturally produced morphine.
就像天然的吗啡一样。

224
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.676
Now, all of this passes under our conscious radar,
所有的这些，我们的意识 都探测不到，

225
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.380
which is why we conflate online activity with the real thing.
这也就是我们常把现实和网络活动 混淆为一物的原因。

226
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.356
But we do have evidence now, fresh evidence,
而我们现在已经有了证据， 最新的证据

227
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.716
that there is a difference.
证明了它们有区别的。

228
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.796
So let's look at some of the neuroscience.

239
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.356
who were watching her talk about the same subject

but in a canned video, like on YouTube.
就像看YouTube视频一样。

241
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.396
And by the way, if you want to know
另外，如果你想知道

242
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.236
how she fit two people in an MRI scanner at the same time,

243
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.460
talk to me later.

245
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.820
This is your brain on real social interaction.

246
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.556
What you're seeing is the difference in brain activity

247
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.716
between interacting in person and taking in static content.

248
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.716
In orange, you see the brain areas that are associated with attention,

249
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.956
social intelligence --

This face-to-face contact provides stunning benefits,

I'm wondering if there's a middle path.

So you talk about the neurotransmitters connecting when in face-to-face,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.076
that we could make in the technology.
是可以在科技中实现的。

336
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.556
For example, the camera on your laptop is at the top of the screen,
比如，你的摄像头 是在手提电脑屏幕的最上方，

337
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.636
so for example, when you're looking into the screen,

you're not actually making eye contact.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.756
So something as simple as even just looking into the camera

340
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.036
can increase those neurotransmitters,
也可以促进神经递质的释放，

or maybe changing the position of the camera.
又或许可以改变一下摄像头的位置。

So it's not identical, but I think we are getting closer with the technology.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.116
