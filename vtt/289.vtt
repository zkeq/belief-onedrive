95
00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:05.762
some colonies forage less than others

106
00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:32.649
because a colony like that would forage less.
[AI] 因为那样的一个殖民地会吃得更少。

107
00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.788
And this raises an analogous question about brains.

108
00:04:35.788 --> 00:04:37.200
We talk about the brain.

114
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.606
and that would lead to differences in brain function.

115
00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:55.940
So in order to ask evolutionary questions.

121
00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:11.151
Each symbol is a colony.

123
00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:16.330
because we were able to use genetic variation

142
00:05:58.234 --> 00:06:00.478
can't be learning this from the parent colony.
