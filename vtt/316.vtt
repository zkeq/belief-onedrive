I am a transgender man,

9
00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:37.135

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.339
instead of "Female."

Walking around as a woman in the world

felt like walking with pebbles in my shoes.

queer是一个文化术语，（可以表示古怪的，或是俚语同性恋）

26
00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:13.025

as a bisexual, as a lesbian --

the fact that he was queer

meant that I could trust his courtship from the very beginning.

As queer and trans people,

including the conventions of time.

And in those 3,000 messages between us,

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:06.384

that we should treat other people the way we want to be treated.

51
00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:11.229
But the problem with that

52
00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:14.484
is that it assumes that we are the standard for other people,

53
00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:15.728
and we're not.

54
00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:19.242
We need to treat other people the way they want to be treated,

55

which means we had to ask.

56
00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.722
I couldn't assume that the kind of love that Tiq needed

was the same kind of love that I needed.

of being rejected and utterly depleted.

I had someone look me in my eyes

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:51.548
It's reasoned, justified and often signed into law.

68
00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:54.587
And I was a heartbeat away from internalizing that message,

with a long history of community work behind us,

I often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths

because I was supposedly born in the wrong body?

(Laughter)
（笑声）

144
00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:04.443

00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:09.919
and the law was never supposed to recognize it.
法律也从不应该去认可它。

147
00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:13.868
KKM: So on May 5, 2014,
KKM：所以在2014年5月5号，

148
00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:16.973
just about three months after meeting online,
在网上认识三个月之后，

149
00:06:16.997 --> 00:06:21.577
we were married on the steps of City Hall in Manhattan,
我们在曼哈顿市政厅的台阶上结婚了，

150
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:25.258
and it was beautiful in every conceivable way.
从各个方面来看都十分美好。

151
00:06:25.637 --> 00:06:28.924
It's safe to say that we reimagined some traditions,
保守的说，我们重构了一些传统，

152
00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:31.762
but we also kept some old ones that we worked in,
但是我们也保留了一些老的，我们适用的，

153
00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.897
and we created something that worked for us.
我们创造了让我们能彼此接受的方式

154
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:39.221
My bouquet and corsage was actually filled with wildflowers from Brooklyn --
我的花束和胸花都是用布鲁克林的野花填补的－

155
00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:43.354
also added in a little bit of lavender and sage to keep us grounded
还加上了一点点薰衣草和鼠尾草让我们保持平定

156
00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:45.085
because we were so nervous.
因为我们太紧张了。

157
00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:48.639
And it was put together by a sweet sister healer friend of ours.
这一切都是由我们可爱的姐妹医生朋友操办的。

158
00:06:48.663 --> 00:06:50.302
I never wanted a diamond ring,
我从来都不想要一枚钻戒，

159
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.794
because conflict and convention are not my thing,
因为冲突和传统不是我的风格，

160
00:06:52.818 --> 00:06:54.623
so my ring is the deepest purple,
我的戒指是暗紫色的，

161
00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.291
like the color of my crown chakra,
就像我的皇冠脉轮的颜色，

162
00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.455
and set in place with my birthstones.
然后在中间镶上我的出生石。

163
00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:00.921
The gift of queerness is options.
我的身世也是一份选择的礼物。

164
00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.081
I never had to choose his last name,
我不必去选择他的姓氏，

165
00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:04.727
it was never an exception,
这本是没有例外的事，

166
00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:08.080
but I did because I am my father's bastard child,
但是我有的原因是我是父亲的私生子

167
00:07:08.104 --> 00:07:12.106
someone who has always been an apology, a secret, an imposition.
我就是一个充满歉意的，秘密的，强加的存在。

168
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.183
And it was incredibly freeing
能够去选择第一次选择了我的男人的名字

169
00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.996
to choose the name of a man who chose me first.
那种感觉是难以置信的放飞。

170
00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:19.969
(Applause)
（掌声）

171
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:27.795
TM: So we told some family and some close friends,
TM：所以当我们告诉家人和朋友，

172
00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.017
many of whom were still in disbelief as we took our vows.
他们中的许多都难以置信我们宣了誓。

173
00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:34.935
Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding photos on Facebook,
确切的说，我们把结婚照都放在了Facebook上，

174
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.160
where we met --
就是我们第一次相遇的地方——

175
00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:37.909
and Instagram, of course.
当然，还有Instagram。

176
00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:39.994
And we quickly realized
然后，我们很快意识到

177
00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:43.216
that our coming together was more than just a union of two people,
我们在一起不仅仅是两个人的结合，

178
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.222
but was a model of possibility for the millions of LGBTQ folks
而是给那些被贩售了谎言——家庭和婚姻

179
00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:48.575
who have been sold this lie
与他们天生对立——

180
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.528
that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are --
的同性恋，双性恋，和跨性别人群树立了一种可能性，

181
00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:54.282
for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves
给那些很少能在爱与幸福的瞬间里

182
00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:55.907
reflected in love and happiness.
看到自己身影的人们树立了可能性。

183
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:57.409
KKM: And the thing is,
KKM：事实上，

184
00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:00.155
absolutely we are marginalized because of our identities,
我们被边缘化当然是因为我们的身份，

185
00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.514
but it also emboldens us to be the people that we are.
但这也使我们有胆量去展现真实的自我。

186
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:05.769
Queerness is our major key;
对性别认同感到疑惑是我们的钥匙；

187
00:08:05.793 --> 00:08:07.695
blackness is our magic.
黑暗是我们的魔法。

188
00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:09.315
It's because of these things
是因为这些东西，

189
00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:14.096
that we are able to be hopeful, open, receptive and shape-shifting.

190
00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.319
These are the things that give us,

192
00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:21.247
Our queerness is a source of that strength.
我们的性别认同疑惑就是力量的源泉。

193
00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:24.381
I think of the words of Ottawa-based poet Brandon Wint:
我想起了渥太华诗人布兰登･温特的话：

194
00:08:24.874 --> 00:08:28.986
"Not queer like gay; queer like escaping definition.
“性别认同疑惑不仅仅是同性恋，而是一种好似被逃避的定义。

195
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.152
Queer like some sort of fluidity and limitlessness all at once.
性别认同疑惑是一种瞬间的流动性，无拘束感。

196
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.518
Queer like a freedom too strange to be conquered.
性别认同疑惑是一种无法抗拒的自由力量

197

Queer like the fearlessness to imagine what love can look like,

198
00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.111
and to pursue it."

199

TM: We are part of a community of folks --

204
00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:57.020
despite the ubiquitous threat of violence,

206
00:09:00.101 --> 00:09:02.369
for people who live on their own terms.

Globally, a transgender person is murdered every 21 hours.
从世界范围来说，每21个小时就会有一名跨性别人士被谋杀。

208
00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:13.572
And the United States has had more trans murders on record this year
而美国今年记录在案的跨性别人群谋杀案

209
00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:15.013
than any year to date.

210
00:09:15.037 --> 00:09:19.102
However, our stories are much more than this rigid dichotomy
然而，我们的故事远不只是这种力量与柔韧

211
00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:20.578
of strength and resilience.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.719
We are expanding the human complexity on these margins,

organizing families based on love and not by blood,

guiding by a compassion that so few of us have been shown ourselves.

have been betrayed by the people that we trust most.

as a tool of revolutionary change, right?

And the idea is simply,

226
00:10:11.598 --> 00:10:13.724

in their body, in their gender, in their skin --

Our experience does not invalidate other peoples' experience,

我的自我性也可能阻碍我们夫妇的进步。

For so many different reasons,

but based on the content about our values and our lived experiences --

and we were really hurt, you know?

因为我们把所做的，我们爱的方式投放在了极大的风险里。

We were able to come back together to each other,

and recommit to ourselves, to each other and to our marriage.

TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,

I've had to interrogate masculinity;

I have allowed my wife to do all of the emotional labor
我让我的妻子去从事打开情感信号通路的工作

272
00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:37.933
of prying open the lines of communication when I'd rather clam up and run away.

273
00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.084

00:12:39.108 --> 00:12:43.357
I've stripped away emotional support instead of facing my own vulnerabilities,

275
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:46.796
particularly around the heartbreaking miscarriage we suffered last year,

and I'm sorry for that.

278
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.017

280
00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:02.741
by the power it wields, by the entitlements afforded to it,

281
00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:05.270
or any simulacrum of control that it can muster,

282
00:13:05.294 --> 00:13:07.112
but works in tandem with femininity,
