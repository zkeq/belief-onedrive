self-transformation projects occupy a very positive emotional space.

energizing, even exhilarating.
充满活力或者让人非常愉悦兴奋

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.156
I mean just take a look at some of the titles of self-help books:

you can't help but get a sense of the excitement.

00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:28.396

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.700
frantically searching for some place to run and hide.
此刻最想做的时候就是逃离或者找地方躲起来

31
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.436
Well, you can run,
当然，你可以跑掉

32
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.740
but you really can't hide.
但是，你根本无处可藏

33
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.836
Most of us spend the majority of our waking hours

40
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.300
I call this the era of "always-on" transformation.

41
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.476
When I shared this idea with my wife Nicola,

That sounds exhausting."
这听起来让人觉得很疲惫

44
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.756
And that may be exactly what you're thinking --
这就和你想的一样

45
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.356
and you would be right.
而且你可能是对的

46
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.516
Particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations

47
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.900
the way we always have been.
也就是我们一直以来的样子

48
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.156
But because we can't hide,
但是，因为我们无法躲藏

49
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.876
we need to sort out two things.
我们需要弄清楚两件事情

50
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.116
First,
第一

51
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.876
why is transformation so exhausting?
为什么改变如此令人疲惫？

52
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660
And second, how do we fix it?
第二，我们应该怎么解决？

53
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.236
First of all,
首先

54
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.396
let's acknowledge that change is hard.
我们必须要承认，改变是困难的

55
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.436
People naturally resist change,
人们自然而然的抗拒改变

56
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.100
especially when it's imposed on them.
特别是这种改变是强加在他们身上的时候

57
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.596
But there are things that organizations do that make change even harder
而且有一些组织把改变这件事情变得更难了更让人疲惫

58
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.460
and more exhausting for people than it needs to be.
尽管改变本身并没那么糟糕

59
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.756
First of all,
比如说

60
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.220
leaders often wait too long to act.
领导们常常不会及时行动

61
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.076
As a result,
后果是

62
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.540
everything is happening in crisis mode.
所有的事情都在大家的危机情绪中发生了

63
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.158
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.
这种情绪当然会导致“精疲力尽”

64
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.276
Or, given the urgency,
或者对于紧急情况来说

65
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.220
what they'll do is they'll just focus on the short-term results,
他们会做的是基于短期内会有所结果的事情

66
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.300
but that doesn't give any hope for the future.
这对未来并不会有什么好的改观

67
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.100
Or they'll just take a superficial, one-off approach,
或者他们只会采取一些表面的，一次性的措施

68
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.956
hoping that they can return back to business as usual
希望他们可以如同往常一样开展以往的工作

69
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.580
as soon as the crisis is over.
当这种危机结束的时候

70
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.636
This kind of approach
这种方式

71
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.740
is kind of the way some students approach preparing for standardized tests.
就和学生为了标准考试准备的方式一样

72
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.556
In order to get test scores to go up,
只是为了得到理想的分数

73
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.180
teachers will end up teaching to the test.
老师们最终沦只为分数忙碌

74
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.356
Now, that approach can work;
目前阶段，这种方式是有效的

75
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.316
test results often do go up.
考试结果会变好

76
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.116
But it fails the fundamental goal of education:
但是却失去了让学生能够在未来成功的

77
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.260
to prepare students to succeed over the long term.
教育的本质职能

78
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.020
So given these obstacles,
所以，面对这些困难的时候

79
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.796
what can we do
我们能够做什么呢

80
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.276
to transform the way we transform organizations
应该要改变改造组织的方式

81
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.260
so rather than being exhausting,
而不是让人觉得精疲力尽

82
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.860
it's actually empowering and energizing?
改变本身是让人有权利掌控感和经济充沛的吗？

83
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.996
To do that, we need to focus on five strategic imperatives,
为了达到这样的目的，我们应该关注五个战略要点

84
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.755
all of which have one thing in common:
这所有的要点都有一个相同的前提

85
00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.060
putting people first.
就是把人放在第一位

86
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.556
The first imperative for putting people first
第一个以人为本的要点

87
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.340
is to inspire through purpose.
是在目的中激励大家

88
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.636
Most transformations have financial and operational goals.
大多数的改革都是有财务和管理目的的

89
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.916
These are important and they can be energizing to leaders,
这些因素很重要，同时对领导来说是振奋人心的

90
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.500
but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization.
但对于组织中的其他大多数人来说，却不那么振奋人心

91
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.076
To motivate more broadly,
为了更宽泛的激励大家

92
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.500
the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose.
这样的转变需要更好的和目标感结合

93
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.740
Take LEGO.
拿乐高举个例子

94
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.700
The LEGO Group has become an extraordinary global company.
乐高集团在有力的领导下已经是一个及其大的国际化集团

95
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.076
Under their very capable leadership,
已经变成了非常大的国际化集团

96
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.940
they've actually undergone a series of transformations.
事实上，他们也经历过一系列的改革

97
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.836
While each of these has had a very specific focus,
他们所有的改革都有一个非常明确的目标

98
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.156
the North Star,
比如说，具有连接和指导功能的

99
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.996
linking and guiding all of them,
北星商场计划

100
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.460
has been Lego's powerful purpose:
以及成为了乐高强有力的目的

101
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.060
inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.
那就是：启发和培养未来的主人翁们

102
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.380
Expanding globally?
或者是为了企业的国际化的扩张？

103
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.396
It's not about increasing sales,
这并不是为了增长销售额

104
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.060
but about giving millions of additional children access to LEGO building bricks.
只是为了让成千上万的孩子可以享受乐高的乐趣

105
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.180
Investment and innovation?
投资和动机？

106
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.638
It's not about developing new products,
这也不是为了开发新产品

107
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.476
but about enabling more children
这是为了促使孩子们

108
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.020
to experience the joy of learning through play.
在游戏中找到学习的乐趣

109
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.796
Not surprisingly,
这并不让人觉得惊讶

110
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.900
that deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.
这种心底的目的认同感极大的激励了乐高的所有员工

111
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.876
The second imperative for putting people first
以人为本的第二要点

112
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.620
is to go all in.
就是全力以赴

113
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.596
Too many transformations
对于大多数的改革来说

114
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.356
are nothing more than head-count cutting exercises;
只是一场裁员运动

115
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.860
layoffs under the guise of transformation.
用改革来掩饰裁员的目的

116
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.836
In the face of relentless competition,
在激烈的竞争面前

117
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.796
it may well be that you will have to take the painful decision
这可能是你需要作出的一个痛苦决定

118
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.676
to downsize the organization,
减少组织的规模

119
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.380
just as you may have to lose some weight in order to run a marathon.
就和你为了完成马拉松需要减轻一些体重一样

120
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.036
But losing weight alone
但是只是减轻体重

121
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.900
will not get you across the finish line with a winning time.
并不会让你成为马拉松的赢家

122
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.580
To win
为了成为冠军

123
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.460
you need to go all in.
你需要全力以赴

124
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.740
You need to go all in.
重要的事情，再说一遍，全力以赴

125
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.820
Rather than just cutting costs,
并不仅仅是减少成本

126
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.996
you need to think about initiatives

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.716
that will enable you to win in the medium term,

128
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.716
initiatives to drive growth,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.796
actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates,

130
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.356
and very importantly,
还有非常重要的一点

131
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.020
investments to develop the leadership and the talent.

132
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.276
The third imperative for putting people first

133
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.996
is to enable people with the capabilities

134
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.860
that they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond.

135
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.340
Over the years I've competed in a number of triathlons.
在这些年终，我所经历的铁人三项中

136
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.276
You know, frankly, I'm not that good,
老实说，我并不是非常擅长

137
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.316
but I do have one distinct capability;
但是我却是是有一项特别的能力

138
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.020
I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.
我能非常迅速的找到我的自行车

139
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.356
(Laughter)
（笑）

140
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.196
By the time I finish the swim,
当我完成游泳的时候

141
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.076
almost all the bikes are already gone.
几乎所有的自行车都不见了

142
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.580
(Laughter)
（笑）

143
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.036
Real triathletes know that each leg --
老资格铁人三项参赛者都知道所有的项目

144
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.796
the swim, the bike, the run --

we need to be sure that we're giving our people
