00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:14.161
Hi.
嗨，

2
00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.003
You might have noticed that I have half a beard.
你可能已经注意到了 我只有半边胡子，

3
00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:19.566
It's not because I lost a bet.
这不是因为我打赌输了。

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.543
Many years ago, I was badly burned.
很多年前，我被严重烧伤。

5
00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.630
Most of my body is covered with scars,
我身体大部分都被伤疤覆盖，

6
00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:26.502
including the right side of my face.
包括我这右半边脸。

7
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.294
I just don't have hair. That's just how it happened.
我只是不再长胡子。 事情就是这样发生的。

8
00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.685
It looks symmetrical, but almost.
它看起来挺对称的， 差不多。

9
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.796
Anyway, now that we discussed facial hair,
不管怎样，我们已经谈论了胡子，

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.698
let's move to social science.
我们开始说社会科学。

11
00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:43.963
And in particular, I want us to think about where is the potential for humanity
尤其是，我想要大家思考的是 人类的潜能有多大，

12
00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:45.285
and where we are now.
并且我们已经到达了哪个水平。

13
00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.777
And if you think about it, there's a big gap
如果你想一下这个问题，

14
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.323
between where we think we could be and where we are,
在我们认为已经达到的水平 和能够达到的水平

15
00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:52.468
and it's in all kinds of areas.
不论哪一方面， 这里都有个很大的差距。

16
00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:54.563
So let me ask you:
所以，让我问你：

17
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.638
How many of you in the last month have eaten more than you think you should?
你们多少人上个月饮食超量了？

18
00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.670
Just kind of general. OK.
这就很普遍，好。

19
00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:05.156
How many of you in the last month have exercised less than you think you should?
你们多少人上个月 运动量没有达标？

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.119
OK, and for how many of you has raising your hands twice
好，你们多少人举手两次

21
00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:10.083
been the most exercise you got today?
已经是今天最大的运动量了？

22
00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:12.429
(Laughter)
（笑声）

23
00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.128
How many of you have ever texted while driving?
你们多少人在开车的时候 发过短信？

24
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.376
OK, we're getting honest. Let's test your honesty.
好，大家都在说实话。 让我们测一下你的诚实度。

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.402
How many people here in the last month
你们在座多少人 在上个月

26
00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:26.312
have not always washed your hands when you left the bathroom?
上完厕所没洗手？

27
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.974
(Laughter)
（笑声）

28
00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:29.172
A little less honest.
没那么诚实了。

29
00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:32.823
By the way, it's interesting how we're willing to admit texting and driving
顺便，这很有趣。 我们对开车时发短信的承认意愿度

30
00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:34.896
but not washing our hands, that's difficult.
竟然比不洗手高。这不简单。

31
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620
(Laughter)
（笑声）

32
00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:38.486
We can go on and on.
我们可以一直问问题。

33
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.273
The problem, the topic is that there's lots of things
问题是，有很多事情， 当我们知道自己能够做到——

34
00:01:41.297 --> 00:01:43.341
when we know what we could do --
我们会变得极其不一样，

35
00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:47.005
we could be very, very different, but we're acting in a very different way.
但是这个情况下， 我们的应对行为截然不同。

36
00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.282
And when we think how do we bridge that gap,
当我们思考如何 能够缩小那个差距时，

37
00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.391
the usual answer is, "Just tell people."
通常的回答是“就告诉他们”。

38
00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:55.623
For example, just tell people that texting and driving is dangerous.
比如，就告诉他们 开车时候发短信很危险。

39
00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:58.187
Did you know it's dangerous? You should stop doing it.
你知道这很危险吗？ 你应该停止做这件事。

40
00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:01.002
You tell people something is dangerous, and they will stop.
你告诉他们一件事很危险， 之后他们就会停止做它。

41
00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.712
Texting and driving is one example.
开车时发短信，只是一个例子。

42
00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.964
Another very sad example is that in the US,
另一个非常悲哀的例子就是， 在美国，

43
00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:08.472
we spend between seven and eight hundred million dollars a year
我们每年大约花费 七亿到八亿美元

44
00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.518
on what's called "financial literacy."
在我们所谓的“金融知识”上。

45
00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:13.517
And what do we get as a consequence of that?
我们做这事的结果是什么？

46
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:17.640
There was recently a study that looked at all the research ever to be conducted
有个最近的研究， 调查了所有有关金融知识的论文——

47
00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:20.458
on financial literacy -- what's called a meta-analysis.
我们称之为整合分析。

48
00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:23.294
And what they found is that when you tell people,
研究发现，当你告诉人们，

49
00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:25.232
you teach them financial literacy,
你教他们金融知识，

50
00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:27.643
they learn and they remember.
他们学会了、记住了，

51
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:30.650
But do people execute? Not so much.
但是他们执行了吗？基本没吧。

52
00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:32.923
The improvement is about three or four percent
3% - 4% 的进步只是 体现在

53
00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:34.808
immediately after the course,
刚刚课程结束后，

54
00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:36.498
and then it goes down.
之后便出现下滑。

55
00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.229
And at the end of the day,
到头来，

56
00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:41.912
the improvement is about 0.1 percent --
进步率仅为 0.1% ——

57
00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:45.408
not zero, but as humanly close to zero as possible.
不是 0，但是从人的角度看， 接近于 0。

58
00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:47.730
(Laughter)
（笑声）

59
00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:49.485
So that's the sad news.
所以这是一件令人悲伤的事。

60
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.062
The sad news is, giving information to people
令人悲伤的是：给予人们信息

61
00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:54.445
is just not a good recipe to change behavior.
并不是改变行为的好方法。

62
00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:56.003
What is?
那什么是？

63
00:02:56.027 --> 00:02:58.880
Well, social science has made lots of strides,
社会科学已经取得了很大的进步，

64
00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:02.607
and the basic insight is that if we want to change behavior,
而其的基本观点是： 如果我们想要改变行为，

65
00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:04.366
we have to change the environment.
我们必须改变环境。

66
00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.441
The right way is not to change people, it's to change the environment.
正确的方法不是改变人们， 而是改变环境。

67
00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.993
And I want to present a very simpleminded model of how to think about it:
我想提出一个非常简单的思维模式 来想这件事：

68
00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:14.039
it's to think about behavioral change
把行为改变

69
00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:17.119
in the same way that we think about sending a rocket to space.
当作送火箭上太空 来思考这个问题。

70
00:03:17.582 --> 00:03:19.986
When we think about sending a rocket to space,
当我们想到送火箭上太空，

71
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.456
we want to do two main things.
我们一般主要要做两件事。

72
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.937
The first one is to reduce friction.
第一件事，就是减少摩擦。

73
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.111
We want to take the rocket and have as little friction as possible
我们想要乘坐火箭， 并且尽可能减少摩擦，

74
00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:29.186
so it's the most aerodynamic possible.
尽量最大化满足空气动力学。

75
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.733
And the second thing is we want to load as much fuel as possible,
第二件事，就是我们想要 装载尽量多的燃料，

76
00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:36.741
to give it the most amount of motivation, energy to do its task.
给火箭足够多的动力和能量， 来完成它的任务。

77
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.647
And behavior change is the same thing.
而行为改变也是一样。

78
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.046
So let's first talk about friction.
我们首先来说说摩擦。

79
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:46.095
In this particular case study I'll tell you about,
在这个特定的案例分析中， 我会给你讲一个

80
00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.282
there's a pharmacy, an online pharmacy.
药店的故事，一个网上药店。

81
00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:51.207
Imagine you go to your doctor.
想象一下你去找你的医生，

82
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.873
You have a long-term illness,
你有一个慢性疾病，

83
00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:55.734
your doctor prescribes to you a medication,
医生给了开了药，

84
00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:58.052
you sign up for this online pharmacy
你注册了这个网上药店

85
00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:00.965
and you get your medication in the mail every 90 days.
之后每隔 90 天， 你会收到这些药的邮寄包裹。

86
00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.489
Every 90 days, medication, medication, medication.
每 90 天，药，药，药。

87
00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:07.612
And this online pharmacy wants to switch people
之后这个网上药店

88
00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:10.266
from branded medication to generic medication.
想要让人们 从品牌药换成仿制药。

89
00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:13.050
So they send people letters, and they say,
所以他们给人们寄了信，说：

90
00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:15.378
"Please, please, please, switch to generics.
“拜托，拜托，拜托， 换成仿制药。

91
00:04:15.402 --> 00:04:18.829
You will save money, we will save money, your employer will save money."
由此你可以省钱，我们可以省钱， 你的雇主也能省钱。”

92
00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:20.081
And what do people do?
人们什么反应？

93
00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:21.628
Nothing.
没有任何反应。

94
00:04:21.652 --> 00:04:24.130
So they try all kinds of things and nothing happens.
之后他们尝试了各种方法， 依旧没有任何改变发生。

95
00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:27.246
So for one year, they give people an amazing offer.
后来，他们给人们 一个一年期的很棒的优惠。

96
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.219
They send people a letter, and they say,
他们给人们寄了一封信，说：

97
00:04:29.243 --> 00:04:32.937
"If you switch to generics now, it will be free for a whole year."
“如果你们现在改成仿制药， 可以免去一整年的药费。”

98
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:34.468
Free for a whole year. Amazing!
一整年免费。多棒啊！

99
00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.847
What percentage of people do you think switched?
你觉得有多少人改了处方？

100
00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:40.286
Less than 10 percent.
不到 10%。

101
00:04:40.924 --> 00:04:43.162
At this point, they show up to my office.
这时候，他们跑来我的办公室。

102
00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:44.635
And they come to complain.
他们开始抱怨。

103
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:46.682
Why did they pick me?
他们为什么选择我？

104
00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:49.477
I wrote a couple of papers on the "allure of free."
因为我写了几篇 关于“免费的诱惑”的研究论文。

105
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:52.718
In those papers, we showed that if you reduce the price of something
在那些文章中，我们表明 如果你给某个东西降价，

106
00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:55.772
for, let's say, 10 cents to one cent, nothing much happens.
假如我们说 10 分到 1 分钱， 不会有太多变化。

107
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.712
You reduce it from one cent to zero, now people get excited.
如果你从 1 分降价到不要钱， 人们就会开始激动起来。

108
00:04:58.736 --> 00:04:59.808
(Laughter)
（笑声）

109
00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:03.113
And they said, "Look, we read these papers on 'free,' we gave 'free.'
之后他们说：“看，我们读了那些 关于‘免费’的文章，所以我们‘免费’给药。

110
00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:04.445
Not working as we expected.
这并不如我们预期，

111
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.698
What's going on?"
究竟怎么回事？”

112
00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:08.883
I said, "You know, maybe it's a question of friction."
我说：“你知道， 这可能是一个摩擦的问题。”

113
00:05:09.378 --> 00:05:10.862
They said, "What do you mean?"
他们说：“什么意思？”

114
00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:12.918
I said, "People are starting with branded.
我说：“人们最初开的是品牌药。

115
00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:15.299
They can do nothing and end with branded.
他们可以什么都不做， 一直开着品牌药。

116
00:05:15.323 --> 00:05:18.990
To move to generic, they have to choose generic over branded,
如果要改成仿制药， 他们必须选择仿制药，

117
00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:20.879
but they also have to do something.
而且他们必须有行动，

118
00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.516
They have to return the letter."
他们需要给你们回信。”

119
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.150
So this is what we call a "confounded design."
所以这就是我们说的 “混杂设计”。

120
00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:27.198
Two things are happening at the same time.
两件事同时发生。

121
00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:28.909
It's branded versus generic,
即，品牌药 vs 仿制药。

122
00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:31.565
but it's doing nothing versus doing something.
但实际却是 无行动 vs 有行动。

123
00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:33.750
So I said, "Why don't we switch it?
所以我说： “我们为什么不调换过来？

124
00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:37.844
Why don't we send people a letter and say, 'We're switching you to generics.
为何不给人们寄封信，告诉他们： 我们将要把你的处方改成仿制药。

125
00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:39.350
You don't need to do anything.
你不需要做任何事情。

126
00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:42.452
If you want to stay with branded, please return the letter.'"
如果你想要保留品牌药的选择， 请给我们回信。”

127
00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:43.630
(Laughter)
（笑声）

128
00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:44.865
Right?
对吧？

129
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.657
What do you think happened?
现在你认为什么情况会发生？

130
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:50.209
Lawyers, lawyers happened.
律师，律师找上门了。

131
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.562
(Laughter)
（笑声）

132
00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:57.682
It turns out, this is illegal.
结果证明，这种做法并不合法。

133
00:05:57.706 --> 00:06:01.104
(Laughter)
（笑声）

134
00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:06.166
By the way, for brainstorming and creativity,
顺便说一下，为头脑风暴和创新，

135
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.744
doing things that are illegal and immoral, it's fine,
做不合法不道德的事情， 没有关系，

136
00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:12.218
as long as it's just in the brainstorming phase.
只要这些事情 仅停留于头脑风暴的层面。

137
00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:13.592
(Laughter)
（笑声）

138
00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:15.418
But this was the purity of the idea,
但这是那想法最纯粹的地方。

139
00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:19.441
because the initial design was the branded had the no-action benefit.
因为这个原始设计是 品牌药有不作为的好处。

140
00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:23.780
In my illegal, immoral design, generic had the no-action benefit.
在我违法、不道德的设计中， 仿制药有了不作为的好处。

141
00:06:23.804 --> 00:06:26.672
But they agreed to give people a T-intersection:
但是他们同意给人们双向选择：

142
00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:28.090
send people a letter and say,

146
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.022

It wasn't that one had the no-action benefit.

This is the story of friction: small things really matter.

157
00:07:02.784 --> 00:07:06.146

and saying: Where do we have too much friction

That's the first part. We talked about friction.

In this particular study,

172
00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:48.254
The Kibera people can borrow at sometimes up to 10 percent interest a week.
基贝拉的人们有时会借那种 高达 10% 周利率的钱。

173
00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:50.887

对吧？我是犹太人， 愧疚感总是有帮助。

187
00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:33.382

196
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:53.291

203
00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:07.359
So we created what we call pre-match.

00:09:07.383 --> 00:09:10.048
We put the 10 shillings in at the beginning of the week.

We said, "It's waiting for you!"
说：“它在等着你！”

206
00:09:11.646 --> 00:09:14.612

之后如果有人存进 40， 我们会说：“喔，你存了 40 ，

207
00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:17.227
we're leaving four, and we're taking six back."
可以给你 4 先令， 另外的 6 先令我们拿走了。”

people get 10 percent.

00:09:23.468 --> 00:09:26.561
they see the money they did not match leaving their account.
他们看到了不匹配的钱 消失在他们的账户上。

212
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.592

我们尝试了短信、来自孩子的短信、 10% 和 20% 现金奖励，

And I sit in this place --

like savings and insurance, that are invisible.

So let's go back to our rocket model.

We have to, first of all, look at the system

310
00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.570
where is there that we can remove friction?

and say: What other motivations can we bring in?

And that's a much more difficult exercise,

Is it going to be something that is visible?

We don't know, and we have to try different things.

So if we think about this gap

看着这个差距，并且思考这件事， 真的非常令人难过。

But if we'll attack each problem directly,

not by just providing more information to people

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:00.189
add motivation,
