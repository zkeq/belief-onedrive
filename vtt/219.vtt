30
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:32.000
And because it's been a false alarm.

31
00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:34.831
it's led to a very conventional way of thinking about this.
[AI] 这导致了一种非常传统的思考方式。

32
00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:37.387
And that says essentially that yes.

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:20.692
That's the way things have played out so far.
[AI] 到目前为止，事情就是这样发展的。

50
00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:24.060
But there is one particular class of worker

(Laughter)
[AI] （众笑）

58
00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.963
So I can ask a very provocative question:
[AI] 所以我可以问一个非常具有挑衅性的问题：

59
00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:46.422
Is it possible that at some point in the future.

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:56.305
Now. you might have a very visceral. reflexive reaction to that.
[AI] 现在你可能有一个非常发自内心的想法。对此的反射反应。

63
00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.976
You might say. "That's absurd.
[AI] 你可能会说。“那太荒谬了。

64
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.669
How can you possibly compare human beings to horses?"
[AI] 你怎么能把人比作马呢？"

65
00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:04.026
Horses. of course. are very limited.

66
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.943
and when cars and trucks and tractors came along.

67
00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.012
horses really had nowhere else to turn.

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:21.502
and that we can always remain relevant to the future economy.
[AI] 我们可以始终与未来经济保持关联。

73
00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:23.963
But here's the really critical thing to understand.

74
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.475
The machines that will threaten workers in the future

80
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.399
on that fundamental human capability --

81
00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:47.226
the thing that makes us so different from horses.
[AI] 使我们与马如此不同的东西。

82
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.484
and the very thing that. so far.

00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:56.459
and. in fact. indispensable to the economy.
[AI] 和事实上经济不可或缺。

86
00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:00.722
So what is it that is really so different

87
00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:02.789
about today's information technology

89
00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:07.437
I would point to three fundamental things.

90
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:11.870
The first thing is that we have seen this ongoing process

93
00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.655
but in fact. it's more broad-based than that;

94
00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:21.829
it extends in many cases. for example. to software.

95
00:04:21.853 --> 00:04:24.853
it extends to communications. bandwidth and so forth.

96
00:04:24.877 --> 00:04:26.861
But the really key thing to understand

97
00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:30.756
is that this acceleration has now been going on for a really long time.
[AI] 这种加速已经持续了很长时间。

98
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.705
In fact. it's been going on for decades.

99
00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.485
If you measure from the late 1950s.
[AI] 如果你从20世纪50年代末开始测量。

100
00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.934
when the first integrated circuits were fabricated.
[AI] 当第一批集成电路制造出来时。

we've seen something on the order of 30 doublings in computational power
[AI] 我们已经看到计算能力大约是30倍

102
00:04:42.767 --> 00:04:47.635
since then. That's just an extraordinary number of times to double any quantity.
[AI] 从那时起这是任何数量翻倍的惊人次数。

103
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:48.899
and what it really means
[AI] 它的真正含义是什么

104
00:04:48.923 --> 00:04:51.447
is that we're now at a point where we're going to see
[AI] 我们现在正处在一个我们将要看到的时刻

105
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:53.882
just an extraordinary amount of absolute progress.

107
00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:58.064
from this point.
[AI] 从这一点来说。

108
00:04:58.088 --> 00:05:00.628
So as we look forward to the coming years and decades.
[AI] 因此，当我们展望未来几年和几十年时。

109
00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:04.687
I think that means that we're going to see things that we're really not prepared for.
[AI] 我认为这意味着我们将看到我们真正没有准备好的事情。

110
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:06.788
We're going to see things that astonish us.
[AI] 我们将看到令我们惊讶的事情。

111
00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:08.078
The second key thing

00:05:08.102 --> 00:05:12.008
is that the machines are. in a limited sense. beginning to think.
[AI] 这是机器的问题。在有限的意义上。开始思考。

113
00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:14.489
And by this. I don't mean human-level AI.

114
00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:17.449
or science fiction artificial intelligence;

115
00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:21.935
I simply mean that machines and algorithms are making decisions.
[AI] 我只是说机器和算法在做决定。

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:25.819
They're solving problems. and most importantly. they're learning.
[AI] 他们在解决问题。最重要的是。他们在学习。

117
00:05:25.843 --> 00:05:29.146
In fact. if there's one technology that is truly central to this
[AI] 事实上如果有一种技术是真正的核心

118
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.247
and has really become the driving force behind this.

123
00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:44.625
was what Google's DeepMind division was able to do

124
00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:46.202
with its AlphaGo system.

126
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.529
at the ancient game of Go.

127
00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:53.703
Now. at least to me.
[AI] 现在至少对我来说是这样。

128
00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:56.844
there are two things that really stand out about the game of Go.
[AI] 围棋有两件事非常突出。

129
00:05:56.868 --> 00:05:59.164
One is that as you're playing the game.
[AI] 一个是当你玩游戏的时候。

130
00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:02.054
the number of configurations that the board can be in
[AI] 电路板可以使用的配置数

131
00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:03.489
is essentially infinite.
[AI] 本质上是无限的。

00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:07.346
There are actually more possibilities than there are atoms in the universe.
[AI] 实际上，宇宙中存在的可能性比原子还多。

133
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.984
So what that means is.

134
00:06:09.008 --> 00:06:12.605
you're never going to be able to build a computer to win at the game of Go
[AI] 你永远也无法建造一台电脑来赢得围棋比赛

135
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.809
the way chess was approached. for example.
[AI] 下棋的方法。例如

136
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:19.359
which is basically to throw brute-force computational power at it.
[AI] 基本上就是用蛮力来计算。

137
00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:23.560
So clearly. a much more sophisticated. thinking-like approach is needed.
[AI] 很清楚。一个更加复杂的系统。需要像思维一样的方法。

138
00:06:24.188 --> 00:06:27.459
The second thing that really stands out is that.
[AI] 第二件真正突出的事情是。

139
00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:30.130
if you talk to one of the championship Go players.
[AI] 如果你和其中一个冠军球员交谈，那就去吧。

140
00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:34.639
this person cannot necessarily even really articulate what exactly it is
[AI] 这个人甚至不可能真正清楚地说出它到底是什么

141
00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:36.878
they're thinking about as they play the game.
[AI] 他们一边玩游戏一边思考。

142
00:06:36.902 --> 00:06:39.095
It's often something that's very intuitive.
[AI] 这通常是非常直观的。

143
00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:42.441
it's almost just like a feeling about which move they should make.
[AI] 这几乎就像是一种他们应该采取什么行动的感觉。

144
00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:43.872
So given those two qualities.
[AI] 考虑到这两个特点。

145
00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:47.833
I would say that playing Go at a world champion level
[AI] 我想说的是，在世界冠军级别上打围棋

146
00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:51.095
really ought to be something that's safe from automation.
[AI] 真的应该是不受自动化影响的东西。

147
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.565
and the fact that it isn't should really raise a cautionary flag for us.
[AI] 事实并非如此，这应该给我们敲响警钟。

148
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.506
And the reason is that we tend to draw a very distinct line.
[AI] 原因是我们倾向于画一条非常清晰的线。

149
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.039
and on one side of that line are all the jobs and tasks
[AI] 在这条线的一边是所有的工作和任务

150
00:07:03.063 --> 00:07:07.811
that we perceive as being on some level fundamentally routine and repetitive
[AI] 我们认为在某种程度上基本上是例行的和重复的

151
00:07:07.835 --> 00:07:09.185
and predictable.

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.067
And we know that these jobs might be in different industries.
[AI] 我们知道这些工作可能在不同的行业。

153
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:15.464
they might be in different occupations and at different skill levels.

154
00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:17.698
but because they are innately predictable.

155
00:07:17.722 --> 00:07:20.849
we know they're probably at some point going to be susceptible
[AI] 我们知道他们可能会在某个时候变得敏感

156
00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.050
to machine learning.

157
00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.493
and therefore. to automation.

00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:25.614
And make no mistake -- that's a lot of jobs.
[AI] 别搞错了，这是很多工作。

159
00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:28.317
That's probably something on the order of roughly half

160
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:29.908
the jobs in the economy.
[AI] 经济中的就业机会。

161
00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:32.091

162
00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:36.186
we have all the jobs that require some capability

163
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.582
that we perceive as being uniquely human.

165
00:07:40.853 --> 00:07:43.118
Now. based on what I know about the game of Go.
[AI] 现在根据我对围棋的了解。

166
00:07:43.142 --> 00:07:46.845
I would've guessed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line.
[AI] 我猜它真的应该在那条线的安全一边。

167
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.047
But the fact that it isn't. and that Google solved this problem.
[AI] 但事实并非如此，谷歌解决了这个问题。

168
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:52.503
suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic.

169
00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:53.706
It's going to shift.
[AI] 它会改变的。

170
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.865
and it's going to shift in a way that consumes more and more jobs and tasks

171
00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:00.906
that we currently perceive as being safe from automation.
[AI] 我们目前认为自动化是安全的。

172
00:08:01.741 --> 00:08:03.398
The other key thing to understand
[AI] 另一个需要理解的关键问题

173
00:08:03.422 --> 00:08:08.560
is that this is by no means just about low-wage jobs or blue-collar jobs.
[AI] 这绝不仅仅是低薪工作或蓝领工作。

174
00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:10.459
or jobs and tasks done by people

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:35.686
about the kind of occupations and tasks and jobs

207
00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:45.853
It's really important to realize

217
00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.819
for him to scale his incredible talents across.

219
00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:24.359
and also to the entire system in terms of it being sustainable.
[AI] 以及整个系统的可持续性。

220
00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:28.727
So the question then becomes: What exactly could we do about this?
[AI] 所以问题就变成了：我们到底能做些什么？

221
00:10:29.105 --> 00:10:32.337
And I think you can view this through a very utopian framework.
[AI] 我认为你可以通过一个非常乌托邦的框架来看待这一点。

232
00:11:05.434 --> 00:11:07.532
we're ultimately going to have to find a way

235
00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:16.644
is some kind of a guaranteed income or universal basic income.
[AI] 是某种有保障的收入或普遍的基本收入。

236
00:11:16.668 --> 00:11:19.156
Now. basic income is becoming a very important idea.
[AI] 现在基本收入正在成为一个非常重要的概念。

237
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.319
It's getting a lot of traction and attention.
[AI] 它得到了很大的吸引力和关注。

238
00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:23.616
there are a lot of important pilot projects

239
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.815
and experiments going on throughout the world.

240
00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:29.648
My own view is that a basic income is not a panacea;
[AI] 我个人的观点是，基本收入不是万能药；

241
00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:32.204
it's not necessarily a plug-and-play solution.
[AI] 它不一定是即插即用的解决方案。

242
00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:33.863
but rather. it's a place to start.
[AI] 而是。这是一个开始。

243
00:11:33.887 --> 00:11:36.669
It's an idea that we can build on and refine.
[AI] 这是一个我们可以建立和完善的想法。

244
00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:39.510
For example. one thing that I have written quite a lot about
[AI] 例如有一件事我写了很多

245
00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:44.126
is the possibility of incorporating explicit incentives into a basic income.
[AI] 是将明确的激励措施纳入基本收入的可能性。

246
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.919
To illustrate that.
[AI] 为了说明这一点。

247
00:11:45.943 --> 00:11:48.711
imagine that you are a struggling high school student.
[AI] 想象一下，你是一个挣扎的高中生。

249
00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:55.487
And yet. suppose you know that at some point in the future.

250
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:56.735
no matter what.
[AI] 不管怎样。

251
00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:00.456
you're going to get the same basic income as everyone else.
[AI] 你将获得和其他人一样的基本收入。

252
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.522
Now. to my mind. that creates a very perverse incentive
[AI] 现在在我看来。这就产生了一种非常反常的激励

253
00:12:03.546 --> 00:12:06.043
for you to simply give up and drop out of school.
[AI] 让你放弃学业，辍学。

254
00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:08.572
So I would say. let's not structure things that way.
[AI] 我可以这么说。让我们不要那样安排事情。

255
00:12:08.596 --> 00:12:13.912
Instead. let's pay people who graduate from high school somewhat more
[AI] 相反让我们给高中毕业的人多付点钱

256
00:12:13.936 --> 00:12:15.632
than those who simply drop out.
[AI] 而不是那些直接辍学的人。

257
00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:19.627
And we can take that idea of building incentives into a basic income.
[AI] 我们可以将激励措施纳入基本收入。

258
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:21.318
and maybe extend it to other areas.
[AI] 也许可以扩展到其他领域。

259
00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:24.919
For example. we might create an incentive to work in the community
[AI] 例如我们可以创造一种在社区工作的激励

260
00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:26.101
to help others.
[AI] 帮助别人。

261
00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:30.383
or perhaps to do positive things for the environment. and so forth.
[AI] 或者也许是为了对环境做一些积极的事情。等等

262
00:12:30.407 --> 00:12:33.418
So by incorporating incentives into a basic income.
[AI] 因此，通过将激励措施纳入基本收入。

263
00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:35.071
we might actually improve it.
[AI] 我们可能会改进它。

264
00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:37.721
and also. perhaps. take at least a couple of steps

265
00:12:37.745 --> 00:12:40.170
towards solving another problem
[AI] 解决另一个问题

266
00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:43.138
that I think we're quite possibly going to face in the future.
[AI] 我认为我们很可能会在未来面对。

267
00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:46.914
and that is. how do we all find meaning and fulfillment.
[AI] 就是这样。我们如何找到意义和实现。

268
00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:49.256
and how do we occupy our time
[AI] 我们如何打发时间

269
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.629
in a world where perhaps there's less demand for traditional work?
[AI] 在一个对传统工作需求较少的世界里？

270
00:12:54.021 --> 00:12:56.826
So by extending and refining a basic income.
[AI] 因此，通过扩大和完善基本收入。

271

is that in the future.

such a degree of stress on our society.
