I thought he was having a small reception.

But what does it mean in practice?

Is it about equality?

where you could give the high performers bonuses and promotions

I thought it was luck,

143
00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:37.613
before we can talk or think about it.
在谈论或者琢磨它之前， 我们就已经知道。

144
00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:41.288
My favorite experiment
有一个我最喜欢的实验，

145
00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:44.041
has six-month old babies

146
00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:47.874
watching a ball trying to struggle up a hill.
看着一个球努力地 想要爬上一个山坡。

147
00:07:48.763 --> 00:07:52.790
And there's a helpful, friendly square that pushes the ball up the hill,
友好且乐于助人的方块 会帮这个球推上山坡，

148
00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:56.059
and then a mean triangle pushes the ball back down.
而卑鄙的三角则想要 把这个球推下去。

149
00:07:56.862 --> 00:07:59.244
After watching this several times,
数次之后，

150
00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:01.338
they ask the babies to pick,
实验人员让婴儿选择

151
00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:02.704
to choose what to play with.
和谁一起玩，

152
00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:06.021
They can pick a ball, a square or a triangle.

153
00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:09.276
They never pick up the triangle.

154
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.164
All the babies want to be the square.
所有婴儿都想和方块一起玩。

155
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.482
And science also shows
科学同样证明，

156
00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.268
that when we see or perceive fairness,
当我们看到或察觉到公平的时候，

157
00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:21.985
our brain releases a substance that gives us pleasure,

158
00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:23.159
proper joy.
令我们愉悦。

159
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.997
But when we perceive unfairness, we feel pain ...

160
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:29.625
even greater pain
甚至要比

161
00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:32.266
than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself.
有时候真的伤到了自己还要痛苦。

162
00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:37.231
That's because unfairness triggers the primitive, reptile part of our brain,
这是因为不公平刺激了 大脑最原始的那部分，

163
00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:40.737
the part that deals with threats and survival,
那个用于处理威胁和 生存问题的部分。

164
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:44.269
and when unfairness triggers a threat, that's all we can think about.

165
00:08:44.293 --> 00:08:47.317

166
00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:48.864
they all go way back.
全都没有了。

167
00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:52.122
And it makes sense that we're wired this way,
我们如此紧张是有道理的，

168
00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:53.661
because we're social animals.

169
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.304
We need to be part of a community to survive.
我们需要成为集体的 一部分才能生存。

170
00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.042
We're born so helpless
我们生来都是如此弱小，

171
00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:03.272
that someone needs to look after us until we're maybe 10 years old,
可能到十岁 都需要有人照顾我们。

172
00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:05.542
so our brain evolves towards food.
所以我们的大脑向食物进化。

173
00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:07.455
We need to be in that community.
我们需要成为集体的一部分。

174
00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.056
So whether I like it or not,

175
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.950
not being invited to the friend's wedding,

176
00:09:12.974 --> 00:09:15.967
my lizard brain is generating the same response

177
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.839
as if I'm about to be pushed out from my community.
让我感觉像被集体排斥了一样。

178
00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:24.885
So science explains quite nicely why fairness is good
因此，科学很好的说明了 为什么公平很好，

179
00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:27.282
and why unfairness makes us really defensive,
为什么不公平让我们如此抵触，

180
00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:30.821
but science also shows that in a fair environment,
但科学同样说明了 在一个公平的环境里，

181
00:09:30.845 --> 00:09:33.920
not only do we all want to be the square,
我们不只是想成为那个方块，

182
00:09:33.944 --> 00:09:36.029
but we tend to be the square,
在潜意识里就是这么认为的。

183
00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:39.554
and this allows other people to be fair in turn.
这让其他人也渐渐地想要变得公平。

184
00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.084
This creates a beautiful fairness circle.
这种现象创造了一个积极的公平循环。

185
00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:45.436
But while we start off fair ...
但虽然我们一开始是公平的……

186
00:09:46.754 --> 00:09:51.817
one drop of unfairness contaminates the whole pool,
一颗老鼠屎却能坏了一锅汤，

187
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.960
and unfortunately, there's plenty of drops in that pool.
不幸的是，很多情况下都是如此。

188
00:09:56.426 --> 00:10:00.387
So our effort should be to filter out
所以我们应该致力于

189
00:10:00.411 --> 00:10:02.507
as much unfairness as we can from everywhere,
尽可能地把不公平去掉，

190
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:05.293
starting from our communities, starting from our companies.
从我们的集体开始，公司开始。

191
00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:12.055
I worry about this a lot because I lead a team of 3,000 excellent people,
我对这些事很担心，是因为我领导着 一个有着三千位优秀员工的团队。

192
00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:16.349
and the difference between 3,000 happy, motivated team workers
最重要的，就是三千名快乐， 充满动力的员工和三千名看着表

193
00:10:16.373 --> 00:10:19.356
and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything.
等着下班的人之间的区别。

194
00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:26.327
So the first thing I try to do in my fairness crusade
所以，在我的公平改革之中， 我尝试的第一件事情就是

195
00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:29.697
is to try to take myself out of the equation.
就是把我自己去掉。

196
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:31.817
That means being aware of my own biases.
我的意思是了解自己的偏见。

197
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:34.491
For example, I really like people who say yes
比如，我特别喜欢 那些不管我说什么

198
00:10:34.515 --> 00:10:35.753
to whatever I suggest.

199
00:10:35.777 --> 00:10:37.122
(Laughter)
（笑声）

200
00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:39.174
But that's not very good for the company
但是这对于一个公司 来说不是什么好事，

201
00:10:39.198 --> 00:10:41.676
and not very good for anyone who has different ideas.
对于那些持有不同意见的人也不好。

202
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.940
So we try to actively promote a culture of diversity of opinions
所以我们想要积极推广 一种包容各种观点

203
00:10:45.964 --> 00:10:47.649
and diversity of character.

204
00:10:47.673 --> 00:10:50.055
The second thing we do is a little more procedural.
我们做的第二件事情 则有一点程序化。

205
00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:53.813
We look at all the rules, the processes, the systems in the company,
我们检阅所有的规定， 流程，和公司的体制，

206
00:10:53.807 --> 00:10:57.403
the ones we use to take decisions and allocate resources,

207
00:10:57.427 --> 00:11:00.790
and we try to get rid of anything that's not very clear,

208
00:11:00.814 --> 00:11:02.664
not very rational, doesn't make sense,
不理性的，不合理的。

209
00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:04.999
and we also try to fix anything that's limiting

210
00:11:05.023 --> 00:11:07.686
the transfer of information within the company.
限制公司内部信息传递的东西。

211
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.998
We then look at the culture and the motivation for the same reasons.
我们又以同样的方式 检视公司文化和积极性。

212
00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:13.737
But my point is that however hard you look at the rules,
但我的观点是， 不管你下了多大工夫去修订规则，

213
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:16.384
the processes, the systems -- and we have to do that --
流程，体系——这些是必要的——

214
00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:18.078
but however hard we look,
但是尽管我们付出很大努力，

215
00:11:18.102 --> 00:11:21.562
we're never going to do enough to get to the real essence of fairness.
我们永远得不到完全的公平。

216
00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:25.744
That's because the last mile of fairness requires something else.
因为达到公平的最后几步 需要一些其他的东西。

217
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.420
It's about what people's emotions are,

218

These are all questions and elements

00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:43.451
that are very hard to put into a spreadsheet, into an algorithm.

223
00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:46.698
It's very hard to make them part of our rational decision.
很难把这些变成我们 做理性决策的一部分。

224
00:11:46.722 --> 00:11:50.358
But if we miss these, we're missing key important points,
但是如果我们少了这些， 就会缺失关键点，

225
00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:52.681
and the outcome is likely to feel unfair.
结果就是，人们又有可能感到不公平。

226
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.167
So we should cross-check our decisions with our fairness center switched on.
所以我们需要在有公平意识的情况下， 反复核对我们的决定。

227
00:11:59.322 --> 00:12:02.678
Is it right that this guy should get the job he's really hoping to get?

231
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:18.942
But if we take the time to ask ourselves

232
00:12:18.966 --> 00:12:23.068
whether the rational answer is the right one ...

233
00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:27.206
we all know deep inside what the answer is.

234
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.841
We've known since we were babies.

235
00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:33.135
And to know what the right answer is
知道答案是什么，

236
00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:35.047
is pretty cool for decision-making.
对于做决定是很有帮助的。

237
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.667
And if we turn on our hearts,
而且，如果我们敞开心扉，

238
00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:42.334
that's the key to getting the real best out of people,
你就可以看到人们真实，最好的一面，

239
00:12:42.358 --> 00:12:45.001
because they can smell it if you care,
因为如果你真的用心的话， 别人是可以感觉到的。

240
00:12:45.025 --> 00:12:48.122
and only when you really care will they leave their fears behind

241
00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:49.953
and bring their true selves to work.
并把他们真正的自我用在工作上。

242
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.160
So if fairness is a keystone of life,
所以，如果公平是人生的基石，

243
00:12:54.184 --> 00:12:57.111
why isn't every leader making it their priority?

244
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.767
Wouldn't it be cool to work in a company that was more fair?

246
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:09.003
that were selected and trained for fairness and for character

247
00:13:09.027 --> 00:13:11.260
and not based on 60-year-old GMATs?
60年不变的GMATs，不是很棒吗？

248
00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:15.450
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to knock on the door
可以去敲“首席公平官”的门

249
00:13:15.474 --> 00:13:17.195
of a Chief Fairness Officer?
难道不好吗？

250
00:13:17.992 --> 00:13:20.719
We'll get there, but why is it not happening now?
我们迟早会这样的， 但为什么不能是现在？

251
00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:23.657
Well, partly, it's because of inertia,
有部分原因是人的惰性，

252
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:26.838
partly, it's because fairness isn't always easy.

253
00:13:26.862 --> 00:13:28.663

257
00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:44.993
But fairness is a risk worth taking,
但是，公平是一个值得尝试的风险，

258
00:13:45.017 --> 00:13:47.573
so we should be asking ourselves,
所以我们需要问自己，

259
00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:49.913
where can we take this risk?

Where can we push ourselves a little bit further,

261
00:13:55.122 --> 00:13:58.081
to go beyond what's rational and do what's right?
