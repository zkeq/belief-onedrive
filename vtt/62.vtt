00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.820
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
好，你们中有谁查过这个单词？

2
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.820
You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.
用字典？（大笑）是的，我想也就这个样子。

3
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.820
How about this word?
这个单词呢？

4
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Here, I'll show it to you.
看看解释：

5
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.820
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
Lexicography(字典学):编纂字典的活动。

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.820
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
注意，这是专用的说法，定义里用“编纂”这个词。

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.820
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,
字典并不是从一大块岩石里凿出的花岗岩，

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
而是由很多的小块小块合起来的。

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.820
It's little discrete --
分离的，

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.820
that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.
英语里边的串法是 D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E——小块

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
And those bits are words.
我们这里说的小块就是指单词了。

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.820
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer --
作为字典编纂者的好处——

13
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,
除了有机会来 TED演讲以外，就是可以说很有趣的单词，

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820
like lexicographical.
例如，lexicographical,字典编纂学。

15
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
Lexicographical has this great pattern:
这个词有一种很棒的押韵，

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.820
it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,
“扬抑抑格”。只要说到“扬抑抑格”，

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)
古怪指数就可以飙升到红色警戒。

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.820
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
其实， lexicographical与 "higgledy-piggledy"(“杂乱无章”的意思)有一样的押韵。

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820
Right? It's a fun word to say,
对吧？这个词单发音就很好玩，

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
and I get to say it a lot.
我常常说它。

21
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer
同时，作为字典编纂者，一个让人郁闷的地方

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
是字典从来没有给人留下一个温暖，舒适的印象。

23
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
对吧？没有人会拥抱他们的字典。

24
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.820
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
但是，其实人们通常对字典的看法是这样的。

25
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
告诉你一件事情，我没有什么纂字哨子，

26
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.820
But people think that my job is to let the good words
尽管大家认为我的工作是让所谓的好词

27
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,
做一个有难度的左转拐入字典，

28
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820
and keep the bad words out.
而把所谓的坏词挡于门外。

29
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
问题是，我不想当交通警察。

30
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.820
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
首先，我不喜欢制服。

31
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.820
And for another, deciding what words are good
而且，决定谁是好词

32
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.820
and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
谁是坏词其实一点也不容易，

33
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.820
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,
还不好玩。如果你的工作中有这么一部分既不容易又不好玩，

34
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
你就会千方百计去回避它。

35
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.820
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation
由此，如果要找一种工作

36
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.820
as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
来比喻我在干的活，我宁可当一个渔夫。

37
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.820
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English
我要在英语这个深蓝的海洋里撒上我的大网，

38
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.820
and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
看可以从海里捕到什么珍异的海产。

39
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.820
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
可是现实中，为什么人们期望我去当交警而不是渔夫呢？

40
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820
Well, I blame the Queen.
这，是英女王的错。

41
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
Why do I blame the Queen?
为什么我要责怪她？

42
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
首先，责怪女王比较有趣，

43
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.820
But secondly, I blame the Queen because
另外的原因是，

44
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.820
dictionaries have really not changed.
自维多利亚女王以来，字典并没有什么变化。

45
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
我们对字典的理解自维多利亚女王统治时期以来没有改变过。

46
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.820
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries
在现代字典里，唯一不会让女王欢喜的是

47
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.820
is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened
对脏话的引入，

48
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
in American dictionaries since 1965.
自1965年起出现在美国字典里。

49
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.820
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
看看这位先生，维多利亚时期的，

50
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.820
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
詹姆斯 穆雷，牛津英语字典的第一位编辑。

51
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.820
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
我没有像他那样的帽子，我多希望有这样的一顶帽子。

52
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.820
So he's really responsible for a lot of
就是他

53
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.820
what we consider modern in dictionaries today.
把我们至今还认为是现代的元素放在字典里。

54
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.820
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,
如果把一个如此打扮的人，看那帽子，

55
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.820
is the face of modernity, you have a problem.
作为现代的代表，那你们就有麻烦了。

56
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.820
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
詹姆斯•穆雷即使活在今天也还是能为任何一本字典担任编纂工作，

57
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.820
There'd be virtually no learning curve.
而无需学习曲线。

58
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
当然，你们中的有些人会说，计算机！

59
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820
Computers! What about computers?
计算机！计算机是新东西吧？

60
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820
The thing about computers is, I love computers.
不要误会，我喜欢计算机，

61
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
我超级喜欢计算机，

62
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.820
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
如果有人不让我用谷歌的图书搜索，我一定会绝食抗议。

63
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820
But computers don't do much else other than
但是，在字典编纂工作中，计算机能起到的作用，

64
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.820
speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
就是加快了编纂的工作进程，仅此而已。

65
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.820
They don't change the end result.
计算机没有改变最终结果。

66
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.820
Because what a dictionary is,
因为字典就是

67
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.820
is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
维多利亚时代的设计和现代推动力的整合。

68
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.820
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
没什么，就是一台电动的脚踏车。

69
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.820
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
给维多利亚时代的设计加上一个引擎，仅此而已！

70
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.820
The design has not changed.
设计上没有任何变化。

71
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
好，那线上字典呢？

72
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.820
Online dictionaries must be different.
线上字典不一样了吧。

73
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.820
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
这是牛津线上英语字典，目前最好的线上字典之一。

74
00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.820
This is my favorite word, by the way.
看一下一个我喜欢的词，

75
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.820
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
Erinaceous:属于刺猬的；刺猬的本性。

76
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.820
Very useful word. So, look at that.
非常有用的词。看看这里，

77
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.820
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
线上字典目前就是把纸质版本放到屏幕前。

78
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.820
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
还是很平面。看看这个单词有几个链接？两个！

79
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820
Right? Those little buttons,
对吧？那些小按键 ，

80
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.820
I had them all expanded except for the date chart.
除了日期纪录，我把他们都展开了。

81
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.820
So there's not very much going on here.
没什么东西，

82
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.820
There's not a lot of clickiness.
没什么可以点击。

83
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.820
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate
事实上， 线上字典继承了

84
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.820
almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
印刷品几乎所有的毛病，除了搜索功能。

85
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.820
And when you improve searchability,
而当搜索功能改善了，

86
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.820
you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
你同时也把印刷品的优势拿走，那就是能不经意间有新的发现的能力。

87
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.820
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,
你能发现一些并不是你要找的东西，

88
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.820
because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
其实是因为找到你想找的东西是如此困难。

89
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:52.820
So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,
所以，（大笑），现在，当你想到这些，

90
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.820
what we have here is a ham butt problem.
我们面对的问题其实是火腿屁股的问题。

91
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.820
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
有人知道火腿屁股的问题吗？

92
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.820
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
有个女人正在弄火腿，给一个大家庭做晚餐。

93
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.820
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,
她正要把火腿根部切去扔掉，

94
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.820
and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,
看着那片火腿，她想，

95
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.820
"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"
“这其实是块好肉，为什么我要把它扔掉呢？”

96
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.820
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
她继续想，“可是我妈都是这么做的”，

97
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.820
So she calls up mom, and she says,
于是她打电话给她妈妈，问，

98
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.820
"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
“妈妈，为什么你做火腿的时候要把火腿屁股切掉？”

99
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.820
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
她妈妈说，“我不知道，我妈一直都这么做的！”

100
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.820
So they call grandma, and grandma says,
于是她们又打电话给外婆，外婆说，

101
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.820
"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)
“我的锅太小了！”（大笑）

102
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.820
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
所以，这不是因为有好词和坏词的存在，

103
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.820
We have a pan that's too small!
只是我们的锅太小了！

104
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.820
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
要知道，其实火腿屁股味道可好了！没理由把它扔掉。

105
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.820
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place
所谓的坏词——当人们想去一个地方，

106
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.820
and they don't find a place on the map,
却不能在地图上找到这个地方，

107
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820
they think, "This map sucks!"
他们就认为，”这地图一点用也没有！“

108
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.820
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,
当人们发现一个旅游指南上没有的夜店或酒吧，

109
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.820
they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."
他们又认为，” 旅游指南上没有的，这地方一定很酷！“

110
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.820
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,
而当人们发现一个字典上没有的单词，他们就觉得

111
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.820
"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
”这个一定是坏词“。为什么呢？这其实更像是一本坏字典的问题。

112
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.820
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
为什么要责怪火腿比锅大呢？

113
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.820
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
你不能找到小一点的火腿，

114
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.820
The English language is as big as it is.
因为英语本身就很大。

115
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.820
So, if you have a ham butt problem,
所以如果你知道火腿屁股这事儿，

116
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.820
and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,
而你又正在考虑这个问题，

117
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.820
the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:
它引向的结论是决绝又有违直觉的：

118
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.820
paper is the enemy of words.
纸张是文字的敌人。

119
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.820
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
怎么可能？我爱书，非常的爱书。

120
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
Some of my best friends are books.
我的一些最好的朋友就是书。

121
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.820
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
但是书本并不是字典最好的载体。

122
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.
有人会疑惑”不要吧，

123
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.820
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
人们不是要把优美的纸质字典拿走吧？“

124
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.820
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
不是。纸质的字典还是会存在的。

125
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.820
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,
当我们有了车，当车成了主要的交通工具，

126
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.820
we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
就不见得要把所有的马匹都毙了。

127
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.820
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,
纸质的字典还是会存在的，

128
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.820
but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
只是不会再是主要的载体了。

129
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape
书本形式的字典不将是唯一形式的字典，

130
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820
dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be
而且不会是

131
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.820
the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
将来字典的原型。

132
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.820
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,
设想一下，如果你有人为的制约，

133
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.820
artificial constraints lead to
这种制约就会引致

134
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.820
arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
一个武断的区分和一个倾斜的世界观。

135
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.820
What if biologists could only study animals
如果生物学家只研究

136
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.820
that made people go, "Aww." Right?
人们喜欢的动物，对吧，

137
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.820
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,
如果我们以审美角度来判断动物，

138
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.820
and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
只研究我们觉得可爱的动物，这会怎样？

139
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.820
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,
我们就只能了解那些有魅力的大群落，

140
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.820
and not very much about much else.
对其它的物种就不太了解了。

141
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.820
And I think this is a problem.
我认为这是一个问题。

142
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.820
I think we should study all the words,
我们应该研究所有的词，

143
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.820
because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions
因为使用词可以创造出美丽的表达，

144
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.820
from very humble parts.
即使是从非常卑下的部分。

145
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.820
Lexicography is really more about material science.
字典编纂学是研究物质的科学。

146
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.820
We are studying the tolerances of the materials
我们在研究不同物料的偏差，

147
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.820
that you use to build the structure of your expression:
当你去架构你的表达的时候：

148
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:49.820
your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,
你的演说和写作。于是人们常常对我说，

149
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.820
"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
”那好，我怎么知道这词是真实存在的？”

150
00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.820
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools
他们认为，“好，如果词语是

151
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.820
that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,
我们用于表达思想的工具，

152
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.820
how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
那你怎么可以说起子比锤子要好？

153
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.820
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
你怎么可以说这种锤子比那种锤子好？

154
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.820
They're just the right tools for the job.
它们只是合适的工具而已。”

155
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.820
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
由此，人们对我说，“我怎么知道一个词是真正的词？”

156
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.820
You know, anybody who's read a children's book
任何读过儿童读物的人

157
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.820
knows that love makes things real.
都知道，爱让事物变真实。

158
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.820
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
如果你爱一个词，用它。这样子，它就成真了。

159
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.820
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
词放在字典里只是人工的区分，

160
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.820
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
这并没有让一个词变得比其它词更真实。

161
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.820
If you love a word, it becomes real.
如果你爱一个词，它才会变真实。

162
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.820
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,
如果我们不需要花心思在指挥交通上，

163
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.820
if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less
如果我们超越了纸张，如果我们少担心

164
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.820
about control and more about description,
控制而更关注表述，

165
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.820
then we can think of the English language
那英语就成为

166
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.820
as being this beautiful mobile.
一个美丽的活物了。

167
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.820
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,
当其中的一个小组件变化了，

168
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.820
is touched, any time you touch a word,
被触动了 ——任何时候你接触到一个单词，

169
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.820
you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,
你把它用到新的内容中，你赋予它新的涵义，

170
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.820
you verb it, you make the mobile move.
你就让它活起来了——让它移动了。

171
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.820
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,
你没有破坏它，只是让它移到一个新的地方，

172
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.820
and that new position can be just as beautiful.
这新的地方也可以是一样美丽。

173
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.820
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop --
现在，你不再是交警——

174
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820
the problem with being a traffic cop is
交警管理交通的问题是

175
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.820
there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,
要么你得在每个十字路口都安排交警，

176
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.820
or the cars get confused. Right?
要么就让车辆犯糊涂。对吧？

177
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.820
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,
然而，如果你的目标不再是指挥交通，

178
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.820
but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
而是去数来往的车辆，那越多双眼睛越好。

179
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.820
You can ask for help!
你可以找人帮忙！

180
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.820
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
越多人帮忙，你可以完成更多的活。我们真的很需要帮忙。

181
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.820
Library of Congress: 17 million books,
国会图书馆有一千七百万本藏书，

182
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.820
of which half are in English.
一半是英语，

183
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.820
If only one out of every 10 of those books
假设其中每十本书

184
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.820
had a word that's not in the dictionary in it,
有一个词不在字典里，

185
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.820
that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
那就相当于超过两本非缩略版字典的词汇量。

186
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.820
And I find an un-dictionaried word --
我发现没收录到字典里边的词(un-dictionaried)——

187
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.820
a word like "un-dictionaried," for example --
以一个像 “un-dictionaried” 那样的未收录词为例——

188
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.820
in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
在我读过的几乎每一本书里都有。还有报纸呢？

189
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.820
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,
报纸藏品从1759年开始，

190
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.820
58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100
共有五千八百一十万个报纸页面。只要每100页

191
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.820
of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,
报纸有一个没有收录的单词，

192
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.820
it would be an entire other OED.
那就相当于一整本 OED(牛津英语字典)了，

193
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.820
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
超过五十万词，那是很大的词汇量。

194
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.820
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --
我还没有说到杂志，博客——

195
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.820
and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week
一周内，我在 BoingBoing发现的新词

196
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.820
than I do Newsweek or Time.
比新闻周刊或时代杂志还多。

197
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.820
There's a lot going on there.
那里正在创造出很多的新词。

198
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.820
And I'm not even talking about polysemy,
这还没说到一词多义，

199
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.820
which is the greedy habit some words have of taking
有些词有贪心的习惯，

200
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.820
more than one meaning for themselves.
自己有好几个意思。

201
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.820
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,
当你想到一个词“set”—“set”可以指獾的穴，

202
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.820
a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,
也可以指伊利沙白时代衣领上的褶——

203
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820
and there's one numbered definition in the OED.
在 OED 里就有好几个定义，

204
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.820
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.

205
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.820
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.

206
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.820
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
其中一个只是说“不同的技术时态。”

207
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.820
Do you know what that says to me?
你知道这对我来说意味着什么？

208
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.820
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)
那就是说周五下午某人想去酒吧。

209
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.820
That's a lexicographical cop out,
用字典编纂学的术语来说，

210
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.820
to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
就是 “不同的技术时态。”

211
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.820
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!
有那么多词，我们真的很需要帮助！

212
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.820
And the thing is, we could ask for help --
事实上，我们可以寻求帮助——

213
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.820
asking for help's not that hard.
要求帮助并不困难。

214
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.820
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
字典编纂不是开发火箭。

215
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.820
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,
看，我刚给了你很多词和很多数字，

216
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.820
and this is more of a visual explanation.
这里是个更形象的解释。

217
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.820
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,
我们可以把字典当作代表英语的地图，

218
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.820
these bright spots are what we know about,
这些亮点是我们已知的，

219
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.820
and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
黑点是未知的。

220
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.820
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
如果这个地图指美国英语的所有单词，我们还有很多不知道。

221
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.820
And we don't even know the shape of the language.
我们连整个语言的轮廓也不知道。

222
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.820
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --
如果这个是字典，美国英语地图——

223
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.820
look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,
看，我们有个大致的佛罗里达州了，

224
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.820
but there's no California!
可是还没有加州！

225
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.820
We're missing California from American English.
连加州都还没有，

226
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.820
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
我们知道的确实很不够，我们甚至连缺了加州这个事情也不知道。

227
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.820
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
我们连地图里有个空白也不知道。

228
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.820
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.
再强调，字典编纂不是开发火箭。

229
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.820
But even if it were, rocket science is being done
即使是火箭开发科学，

230
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.820
by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
当今也有热诚的业余爱好者参与其中了。是吧？

231
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.820
It can't be that hard to find some words!
发现词语不可能有那么难！

232
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.820
So, enough scientists in other disciplines
足够多的科学家在其它领域

233
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.820
are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
正寻求大家帮忙，而且大伙也干的不错。

234
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.820
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers
例如，有一种电子鸟，业余观鸟爱好者

235
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.820
can upload information about their bird sightings.
可以把自己的观察结果上传，

236
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.820
And then, ornithologists can go
之后鸟类学家可以从中

237
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.820
and help track populations, migrations, etc.
追踪数量，迁徙情况等。

238
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.820
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
有个叫 迈克 奥特斯的人，他住在英国，

239
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.820
He's a director of an electroplating company.
他是一家电镀公司的总监。

240
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.820
He's found more than 140 comets.
他发现了超过140个彗星。

241
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.820
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
他发现了如此之多的彗星，有一颗彗星就以他命名。

242
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.820
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
那些彗星比火星还远，是一个长途旅行。

243
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.820
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
我不认为他拍过什么照片。

244
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.820
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
他发现的140颗彗星，并没有用望远镜，

245
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.820
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,
而是从 NASA SOHO卫星下载数据

246
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.820
and that's how he found them.
分析出来的。

247
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.820
If we can find comets without a telescope,
如果我们可以不用望远镜就能发现彗星，

248
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.820
shouldn't we be able to find words?
为什么我们就不能发现单词呢？

249
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.820
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
现在你明白我的立场了。

250
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.820
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
我要去互联网，就像大伙那样。

251
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.820
And the Internet is great for collecting words,
互联网非常合适搜集单词，

252
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.820
because the Internet's full of collectors.
因为互联网上有很多搜集者。

253
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.820
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,
这是一个关于互联网的不为人知的技术事实，

254
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.820
but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
互联网实际上是由单词和热情组成的。

255
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.820
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be
而单词和热情正好是

256
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.820
the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
字典编纂的膳料。那不是很好吗？

257
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.820
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,
现在已经有很多单词搜集网站了，

258
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.820
but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
只是它们中有些还不够科学，

259
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.820
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
有些显示了词，没有显示上下文，

260
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.820
Where did it come from? Who said it?
词从哪里来？谁说的？

261
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.820
What newspaper was it in? What book?
源自哪张报纸？哪本书？

262
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.820
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
因为一个词就像一个考古学产物，

263
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.820
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,
如果你不知道起源或源头，

264
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.820
it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
这就不够科学——这是应该去考究的。

265
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.820
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.
一个没有来源的词就像一朵被剪下来的花。

266
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.820
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
看一会还可以，不久就蔫了。

267
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.820
It dies too fast.
蔫得太快了。

268
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.820
So, this whole time I've been saying,
我一直在说，

269
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.820
"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
“字典，字典， 字典，字典。”

270
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.820
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,
而不是“一本字典”，或“很多字典”，这是因为，

271
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.820
well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
人们用字典去代表整个语言。

272
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.820
They use it synecdochically.
这是一种借代（以点代面）的说法(synecdochically)——

273
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.820
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"
知道“synecdochically”会引起的问题是

274
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.820
is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
你真的很想找个理由去说synecdochically

275
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point
这整个演讲也就是个借口，为了能让我可以有机会

276
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820
where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
跟你们说 synecdochically这个词。

277
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.820
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --
真对不起。但如果你用一样事物的一部分，

278
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.820
like the dictionary is a part of the language,
例如字典是语言的一部分，

279
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.820
or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --
或者用国旗代表美国作为一个国家的象征——

280
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.820
then you're using it synecdochically.
那样你在用借代。

281
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.820
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
不过，我们可以让字典成为语言的全部，

282
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.820
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
如果我们有个大一点的锅，那我们就可以把所有的单词都放里边了，

283
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.820
We can put in all the meanings.
还可以把所有的单词解释都放里边。

284
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.820
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
每个人不都想人生更有意义吗（英语里，意义和单词解释是同一个单词）？

285
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.820
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --
那样，我们就可以让字典不仅仅是语言的象征，

286
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.820
we can make it be the whole language.
我们就可以让字典涵盖整个语言。

287
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.820
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,
你看，我真希望到我儿子的时候——

288
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.820
who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember
这个月他就满7岁了——我想他只记得

289
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.820
that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
这是过去的字典的形式，

290
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
这是过去的字典的样子。

291
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.820
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
我想他把这种字典当成8轨录音带类似的东西，

292
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.820
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
是种已经过时的形式，

293
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.820
It wasn't really what people needed.
不再适合人们的需求。

294
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.820
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,
如果我们可以涵盖所有单词，

295
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.820
no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,
不再人为的区分好词坏词，

296
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.820
we can really describe the language like scientists.
我们就可以像科学家那样的描述语言，

297
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.820
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
我们可以把审美判断留给作家和演讲者。

298
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.820
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,
如果我们可以做到这点，那我就可以把我所有的时间花在捕鱼上，

299
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.820
and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
用不着再当交警。

300
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.820
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
谢谢，感谢您的关注。
