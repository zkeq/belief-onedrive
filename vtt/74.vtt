00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.339

whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.059
that what many of us think of as great leadership
大多数人认为良好的领导能力

6
00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.139
does not work when it comes to leading innovation.

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.740
I'm an ethnographer.

to understand the questions in which I'm interested.

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.200
So along with three co-conspirators,

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.020
I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal

19
00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.740
that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did.

If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,

22
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.779
we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership.

23

25
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.538
But what do we mean by innovation?

It can be a product or service.

It can be a process or a way of organizing.

it looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie,

38
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.059
but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,

My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,

43
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.340
that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef.
一部备受关注的关于一只老鼠 成为大厨的电影。

44
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.259
Computer-generated movies are really mainstream today,

45
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.940
but it took Ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years

在之后的20年里，他们制作了14部电影。

When many of us think about innovation, though,

we think about an Einstein having an 'Aha!' moment.

52
00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.100
But we all know that's a myth.

53
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.060
Innovation is not about solo genius,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.299
it's about collective genius.
而是关于团体的智慧。

55
00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.979
Let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie:
让我们想一想制作一部Pixar电影 都需要些什么：

56
00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:49.500
No solo genius, no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies.
不需要个人才智，不需要灵光一现 去制作那样的一部电影。

57
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.900
On the contrary, it takes about 250 people four to five years,

to make one of those movies.

59
00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.139
To help us understand the process,

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.780
an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture.

He did so reluctantly,
他画的时候很犹豫不决，

62
00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.660
because it suggested that the process  was a neat series of steps

63
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.950
done by discrete groups.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.810
Even with all those arrows, he thought it failed to really tell you

65
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.660
just how iterative, interrelated and, frankly, messy their process was.
这是一个涵盖如此大量重复性和高度关联性， 以及说实话，相当杂乱的过程。

66
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.550
Throughout the making of a movie at Pixar, the story evolves.
故事的发展贯穿一部Pixar电影的制作。

67
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.340
So think about it.

Some shots go through quickly.
一些镜头过得很快。

69
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.380
They don't all go through in order.

70
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.019
It depends on how vexing the challenges are

that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene.
遇到的挑战有多么令人烦恼。

72
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.739
So if you think about that scene in "Up"

73
00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.940
where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird,

那10秒钟的场景花了一个动漫师 接近6个月的时间去达到完美的效果。

75
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.820
The other thing about a Pixar movie
另外一件关于Pixar电影的事，

76
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.220
is that no part of the movie is considered finished

77
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.139
until the entire movie wraps.
直到整部电影制作完成。

78
00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.579
Partway through one production, an animator drew a character

79
00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.580
with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side.

80
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.590
When the director saw that drawing, he thought it was great.
当导演看到绘画的时候，他觉得很棒。

81
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.019
It was beautiful, but he said,

82
00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.840
"You've got to lose it; it doesn't fit the character."
“你不能采用它，这不符合人物形象。“

83
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.300
Two weeks later, the director came back and said,
两周过后，那个导演回来说，

84
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.380
"Let's put in those few seconds of film."

85
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.420
Because that animator was allowed to share

86
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.620
what we referred to as his slice of genius,

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:35.219
What we know is, at the heart of innovation is a paradox.
我们所知道的是， 创新的核心是一个悖论。

90
00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.899
You have to unleash the talents and passions of many people

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:43.629
and you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful.

92
00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.869
Innovation is a journey.

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:56.139
Innovations rarely get created full-blown.

97
00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.269
As many of you know,
正如大部分人知道的那样，

Innovative work can be very exhilarating,

101
00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:13.550
but it also can be really downright scary.

102
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.899
So when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does,

103
00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.659
we have to ask ourselves, what's going on here?
我们必须先自问， 这是一个怎样的团队呢？

104
00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.620
For sure, history and certainly Hollywood,

105
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.750
is full of star-studded teams that have failed.

106
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.610
Most of those failures are attributed
大多数的失败是因为

107
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.699
to too many stars or too many cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.
有太多的明星或者说， 有太多的厨师在厨房里了。

108
00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.339
So why is it that Pixar, with all of its cooks,

109
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:45.180
is able to be so successful time and time again?

When we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai,

or a luxury brand in Korea, or a social enterprise in Africa,

113
00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:57.699

creative abrasion, creative agility and creative resolution.
创意摩擦，创造的灵活性， 以及创新的解决方式。

they don't minimize them.

where people suspend their judgment.
