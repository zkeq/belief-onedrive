1
00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:14.170
Thank you very much.
非常感谢。

2
00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:18.193
Well, I would like to start with testicles.
额，我想先说说睾丸。

3
00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:20.113
(Laughter)
（笑声）

4
00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.772
Men who sleep five hours a night
那些每晚只睡五个小时的男性

5
00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:29.049
have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more.
相比每晚睡够至少七个小时的男性， 有着更小的睾丸。

6
00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:31.874
(Laughter)
（笑声）

7
00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:36.977
In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night
除此之外，习惯性只睡 四到五个小时的男性，

8
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.517
will have a level of testosterone
他们的睾酮水平

9
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.874
which is that of someone 10 years their senior.
和比他们年长十岁的人差不多。

10
00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:48.664
So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade
所以，从睾酮这一关键的健康指标来看，

11
00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:51.473
in terms of that critical aspect of wellness.
缺乏睡眠会让男性老十岁。

12
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:58.183
And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health
我们在女性的生殖健康上也看到了

13
00:00:58.207 --> 00:00:59.624
caused by a lack of sleep.
由缺乏睡眠导致的同等损害。

14
00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:05.557
This is the best news that I have for you today.
这是今天我给你们准备的最好的消息。

15
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.257
(Laughter)
（笑声）

16
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.658
From this point, it may only get worse.
从现在开始，事情只会变得更糟。

17
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.462
Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things
我不仅会告诉你们在你们睡觉时，

18
00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:15.321
that happen when you get sleep,
会发生的美妙的事情，

19
00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:19.826
but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough,
还会告诉你们当睡眠不足时， 发生在你们大脑和身体上的

20
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.381
both for your brain and for your body.
非常糟糕的事情。

21
00:01:23.214 --> 00:01:25.628
Let me start with the brain
让我从大脑以及

22
00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.657
and the functions of learning and memory,
学习和记忆的功能开始讲起，

23
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.950
because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years
因为我们在过去十年的研究发现，

24
00:01:31.974 --> 00:01:34.871
is that you need sleep after learning
在你学习完后，应该睡觉，

25
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:38.182
to essentially hit the save button on those new memories
以按下新记忆的保存按钮，

26
00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:39.506
so that you don't forget.
这样才不会遗忘。

27
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:46.284
But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning
但是最近，我们发现在学习之前 你也需要睡眠，

28
00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:49.379
to actually prepare your brain,
来准备好自己的头脑，

29
00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:51.459
almost like a dry sponge
就像是一块干海绵，

30
00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:53.926
ready to initially soak up new information.
准备好开始吸收新的知识。

31
00:01:54.987 --> 00:01:58.099
And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain
没有睡眠的话，大脑的记忆回路

32
00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:00.894
essentially become waterlogged, as it were,
就像是被堵塞住了，

33
00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:03.075
and you can't absorb new memories.
而你将不能吸收新的记忆。

34
00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.888
So let me show you the data.
让我向你们展示一下数据。

35
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:10.165
Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis
在这个研究中，我们测试了 这么一个假设，

36
00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.737
that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea.
即熬夜到底是不是不错的做法。

37
00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:16.423
So we took a group of individuals
我们招募了一组被试，

38
00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:19.994
and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups:
然后将其分为两组：

39
00:02:20.018 --> 00:02:23.475
a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.
睡眠充足组和睡眠不足组。

40
00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:28.119
Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber,
睡眠充足组的被试可以睡够八个小时，

41
00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:30.811
but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake
而睡眠不足组的被试则在实验室中， 在全程监控下，

42
00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:32.985
in the laboratory, under full supervision.
不断地被我们叫醒。

43
00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:37.858
There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved.
顺便说一句，他们没有小睡或咖啡因的支持， 所以确实很痛苦。

44
00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:39.935
And then the next day,
第二天，

45
00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.259
we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner
我们把这些被试放进MRI扫描仪，

46
00:02:44.283 --> 00:02:48.069
and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts
让他们试着学习一整列的新知识，

47
00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:51.392
as we're taking snapshots of brain activity.
同时记录下他们的大脑活动情况。

48
00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.395
And then we're going to test them
然后，我们测试他们，

49
00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.903
to see how effective that learning has been.
来看看他们的学习到底有没有效。

50
00:02:56.768 --> 00:02:59.704
And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis.
这就是你们所看的纵轴。

51
00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:03.015
And when you put those two groups head to head,
当把这两组被试比较时，

52
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:08.078
what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit
你们可以发现没有充足睡眠的大脑

53
00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:11.578
in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep.
在储存新记忆的能力上 有40%的显著差距。

54
00:03:12.864 --> 00:03:14.714
I think this should be concerning,
我觉得这一发现令人担忧，

55
00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:16.960
considering what we know is happening to sleep
考虑到我们的受教育人群

56
00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:19.403
in our education populations right now.
在睡眠上正在经历的事情。

57
00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.177
In fact, to put that in context,
事实上，说的具体些，

58
00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.698
it would be the difference in a child acing an exam
就是学生在考试中得高分

59
00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:28.622
versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.
和考砸了之间的差距——40%。

60
00:03:30.114 --> 00:03:34.310
And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain
我们进一步研究大脑中 到底哪里出错

61
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.455
to produce these types of learning disabilities.
产生了这种学习障碍。

62
00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.153
And there's a structure that sits
在大脑的左侧和右侧，

63
00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:44.809
on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus.
有着这么一块区域，叫做海马体。

64
00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.618
And you can think of the hippocampus
你们可以把海马体想成

65
00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:49.879
almost like the informational inbox of your brain.
大脑的信息收件箱。

66
00:03:50.454 --> 00:03:53.645
It's very good at receiving new memory files
海马体很擅长接收新的“记忆文件”，

67
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.144
and then holding on to them.
并保留这些文件。

68
00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:58.462
And when you look at this structure
当你们观察

69
00:03:58.486 --> 00:04:01.548
in those people who'd had a full night of sleep,
那些睡了一整晚的被试的海马体时，

70
00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:05.097
we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity.
我们看到的是许多健康的 与学习相关的大脑活动。

71
00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:09.423
Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived,
但是在那些睡眠不足的被试身上，

72
00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:13.073
we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.
我们基本上找不到任何明显的信号。

73
00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:19.533
So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox,
这就好像睡眠不足关闭了记忆收件箱，

74
00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.533
and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced.
任何新进的文件——都被退回了。

75
00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:27.326
You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.
你不能有效的将新的经历转化为记忆。

76
00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:34.381
So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you,
这就是假如我剥夺你的睡眠时， 会发生的糟糕事情，

77
00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:37.477
but let me just come back to that control group for a second.
但容我稍微讲一下对照组。

78
00:04:38.264 --> 00:04:41.596
Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep?
你们还记得那些睡够了八个小时的被试吗？

79
00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:44.714
Well, we can ask a very different question:
我们可以问一个非常不同的问题：

80
00:04:44.738 --> 00:04:48.342
What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep
让你每天睡眠时

81
00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:49.913
when you do get it
恢复和提高你的

82
00:04:49.937 --> 00:04:53.749
that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability
记忆力和学习能力的生理质量

83
00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:54.923
each and every day?
是什么样的？

84
00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:58.806
And by placing electrodes all over the head,
通过在头部放置电极，

85
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.877
what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves
我们所发现的是，在睡眠的最深阶段

86
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:06.520
that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep
会产生巨大而强大的脑电波，

87
00:05:06.544 --> 00:05:08.829
that have riding on top of them
这些脑电波之上会有

88
00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:12.127
these spectacular bursts of electrical activity
我们称之为睡眠纺锤波的

89
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:13.885
that we call sleep spindles.
壮观的电活动爆发。

90
00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:19.308
And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves
正是这些深度睡眠脑电波的综合作用，

91
00:05:19.332 --> 00:05:23.793
that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night,
在夜间起到了文件传输机制的作用，

92
00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:27.888
shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir
将记忆从一个短期的 易受遗忘的存储库

93
00:05:27.912 --> 00:05:32.254
to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain,
转移到大脑中一个更永久 的长期存储库，

94
00:05:32.278 --> 00:05:35.668
and therefore protecting them, making them safe.
因此得以保存它们， 使它们不至受损。

95
00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:39.326
And it is important that we understand
重要的是，我们要了解在睡眠中

96
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.409
what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits,
究竟是什么在发挥这些记忆的作用，

97
00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:48.567
because there are real medical and societal implications.
因为这对医学和社会都有实际的影响。

98
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:50.608
And let me just tell you about one area
让我告诉你们

99
00:05:50.632 --> 00:05:54.068
that we've moved this work out into, clinically,
我们已经把这项研究转移到临床的一个领域，

100
00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:57.305
which is the context of aging and dementia.
即衰老和痴呆。

101
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.115
Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older,
因为随着我们变老， 我们的学习和记忆能力

102
00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.424
our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.
开始衰退和减弱当然 并不是什么秘密。

103
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:08.489
But what we've also discovered
但我们也发现的是

104
00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:15.298
is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse,
衰老的一个生理特征是 你的睡眠质量变差了，

105
00:06:15.322 --> 00:06:19.126
especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing.
尤其在我刚才谈到的 深度睡眠质量中。

106
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.554
And only last year, we finally published evidence
仅仅在去年，我们最终发表了证据

107
00:06:23.578 --> 00:06:26.537
that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring,
表明这两件事，它们 不是简单的同时发生，

108
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:29.379
they are significantly interrelated.
它们是显著相互关联的。

109
00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.944
And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep
这表明深度睡眠的中断

110
00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:36.262
is an underappreciated factor
是导致衰老时认知能力和记忆能力衰退

111
00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:40.199
that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline
的一个低估因素，

112
00:06:40.223 --> 00:06:43.801
in aging, and most recently we've discovered,
最近我们还发现，

113
00:06:43.825 --> 00:06:46.047
in Alzheimer's disease as well.
老年痴呆症也是如此。

114
00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.888
Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news.
我知道这个消息是如此令人沮丧。

115
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:54.215
It's in the mail. It's coming at you.
它在邮寄途中，正在走向你。

116
00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:56.524
But there's a potential silver lining here.
但也有一线希望。

117
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.438
Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging,
跟其他我们已知跟衰老 有关的因素不同的是，

118
00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:06.121
for example changes in the physical structure of the brain,
比如大脑物理结构的改变，

119
00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:09.207
that's fiendishly difficult to treat.
这是非常难以治疗的。

120
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:13.787
But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle
但睡眠是解释衰老和 阿尔茨海默症谜题中

121
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.406
of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting
缺失的一块倒是令人兴奋，

122
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.168
because we may be able to do something about it.
因为我们也许能做点啥对策。

123
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.281
And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center
在我的睡眠中心解决这个问题的方法之一

124
00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:27.313
is not by using sleeping pills, by the way.
不是使用安眠药，顺便说一句。

125
00:07:27.337 --> 00:07:32.266
Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep.
不幸的是，安眠药是钝器， 不能产生自然主义的睡眠。

126
00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:36.599
Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.
反之，我们基于这个原理开发了一个方法。

127
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.838
It's called direct current brain stimulation.
叫做脑直流电刺激方法。

128
00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:43.143
You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain,
你在大脑中注入少量的电压，

129
00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:45.405
so small you typically don't feel it,
小到你基本上感受不到，

130
00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:47.321
but it has a measurable impact.
但却具有可衡量的影响。

131
00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:54.987
Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults,
现在如果你在年轻，健康的 成人睡眠时采用这种刺激，

132
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:59.726
as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves,
就好像你在用那些沉睡的脑电波唱歌一样，

133
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.292
not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,
你不仅能够放大这些深度睡眠脑电波，

134
00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:08.860
but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit
而且这样做，我们可以增强从睡眠中获得

135
00:08:08.884 --> 00:08:10.918
that you get from sleep.
的记忆好处的两倍。

136
00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:13.757
The question now is whether we can translate
现在的问题是我们能否

137
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:18.082
this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology
将这经济实惠，潜在的便携技术

138
00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:20.987
into older adults and those with dementia.
应用到老年人和老年痴呆群体中。

139
00:08:22.546 --> 00:08:27.132
Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep,
我们能否恢复深度睡眠的健康质量，

140
00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:31.775
and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning
并且通过这样做，我们 能否挽救他们的学习

141
00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:33.283
and memory function?
和记忆功能？

142
00:08:33.307 --> 00:08:35.473
That is my real hope now.
这是我目前真实的希望。

143
00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:39.203
That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were.
可以说，这是我们的登月目标之一。

144
00:08:41.155 --> 00:08:44.513
So that's an example of sleep for your brain,
所以这是大脑睡眠的一个例子，

145
00:08:44.537 --> 00:08:47.750
but sleep is just as essential for your body.
但睡眠对你的身体也同样重要。

146
00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:52.771
We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.
我们已经讨论过睡眠不足 和生殖系统的关系。

147
00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:58.545
Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system,
或者我可以告诉你睡眠不足 和你的心血管系统，

148
00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:01.743
and that all it takes is one hour.
而这只需要一个小时。

149
00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:07.275
Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people
因为有一个全球性的实验每年在70个国家

150
00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:11.576
across 70 countries twice a year,
的16亿人身上进行两次，

151
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.489
and it's called daylight saving time.
这个实验叫做夏令时。

152
00:09:14.727 --> 00:09:18.185
Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep,
现在，在春天，当我们少一个小时睡眠时，

153
00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:23.828
we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.
我们看到接下来的第二天 心脏病发作会增加24%。

154
00:09:26.772 --> 00:09:29.947
In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep,
在秋季，当我们获得一个小时的睡眠时，

155
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.839
we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.
我们看到心脏病发作会减少21%。

156
00:09:35.572 --> 00:09:37.252
Isn't that incredible?
是不是让人难以置信？

157
00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:44.425
And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents,
你会看到同样的情况发生在车祸，交通事故，

158
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:46.351
even suicide rates.
甚至自杀率上。

159
00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:51.653
But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this:
但为了更深入些，我想要专注这个：

160
00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:54.168
sleep loss and your immune system.
睡眠不足和你的免疫系统。

161
00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:59.811
And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.
这里，我将介绍图片中 这些明亮的蓝色元素。

162
00:09:59.835 --> 00:10:03.013
They are called natural killer cells,
它们被称为自然杀伤细胞，

163
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:07.887
and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents
你可以把自然杀伤细胞 想象成你免疫系统中的

164
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:09.522
of your immune system.
特勤局特工。

165
00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:14.529
They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements
它们非常擅长识别危险和无需的物体

166
00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:15.950
and eliminating them.
并消灭它们。

167
00:10:17.073 --> 00:10:21.017
In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.
事实上，它们正在做的是 摧毁一个癌变的肿瘤团块。

168
00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:28.342
So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins
所以你一定时刻希望拥有这群有能力

169
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.422
at all times,
的刺客，

170
00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:34.256
and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.
但悲剧的是，当你睡眠不足时， 你不能拥有它们。

171
00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:37.289
So here in this experiment,
所以在这个实验中，

172
00:10:37.313 --> 00:10:41.142
you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night,
你不会整晚都被剥夺睡眠，

173
00:10:41.166 --> 00:10:44.677
you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours
你一个晚上的睡眠将会被限制在

174
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:46.479
for one single night,
4个小时，

175
00:10:46.503 --> 00:10:49.504
and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction
然后我们来看看你的免疫细胞

176
00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:51.518
in immune cell activity that you suffer.
会受到多大比例的影响。

177
00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:55.423
And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,
这并不是个小数目——不是10%，

178
00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:57.450
it's not 20 percent.
不是20%。

179
00:10:57.474 --> 00:11:02.046
There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.
自然杀伤细胞的活力下降高达70%。

180
00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:07.661
That's a concerning state of immune deficiency,
这是个令人担忧的免疫缺陷状态，

181
00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:11.995
and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding
你可能能够理解 我们现在发现的

182
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:15.875
significant links between short sleep duration
短睡眠时间和你患多种癌症

183
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:19.812
and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.
的风险之间存在重要联系。

184
00:11:21.712 --> 00:11:24.495
Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel,
目前，这一名单包括肠癌、

185
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.781
cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.
前列腺癌和乳腺癌。

186
00:11:29.673 --> 00:11:35.029
In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong
事实上，睡眠不足和癌症 之间的联系是如此紧密，

187
00:11:35.053 --> 00:11:37.435
that the World Health Organization
以致世界卫生组织

188
00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:41.649
has classified any form of nighttime shift work
将任何形式的夜班工作

189
00:11:41.673 --> 00:11:44.855
as a probable carcinogen,
列为可能的致癌物质，

190
00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:47.546
because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.
因为你的睡眠-觉醒节律被打乱了。

191
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.380
So you may have heard of that old maxim
你可能听过这句老话，

192
00:11:52.404 --> 00:11:54.516
that you can sleep when you're dead.
你死后自当长眠。

193
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.610
Well, I'm being quite serious now --
我现在是认真的——

194
00:11:56.634 --> 00:11:59.245
it is mortally unwise advice.
这是极其不明智的建议。

195
00:12:00.195 --> 00:12:05.232
We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.
我们从数百万人的流行病学 研究中了解到这一点。

196
00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:07.237
There's a simple truth:
事实很简单：

197
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:10.665
the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.
睡眠越少，生命越短。

198
00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:14.244
Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.
睡眠不足预示着全因死亡率。

199
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.929
And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer
如果让你增加患上癌症

200
00:12:20.953 --> 00:12:23.197
or even Alzheimer's disease
或者甚至老年痴呆症的风险

201
00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:27.397
were not sufficiently disquieting,
还不足够让人不安的话，

202
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:31.119
we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode
我们还发现，缺乏睡眠甚至会侵蚀

203
00:12:31.143 --> 00:12:35.216
the very fabric of biological life itself,
生物生命本身的结构，

204
00:12:36.501 --> 00:12:38.493
your DNA genetic code.
你的DNA遗传密码。

205
00:12:39.858 --> 00:12:43.794
So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults
所以在这个研究中，他们 找来一群健康的成年人，

206
00:12:43.818 --> 00:12:47.557
and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night
在一周内限制他们每晚的睡眠时间

207
00:12:47.581 --> 00:12:49.232
for one week,
在6小时，

208
00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:53.053
and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile
然后测量他们的基因活动

209
00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:55.521
relative to when those same individuals
与每晚睡足8小时的人

210
00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:58.092
were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.
对比的变化。

211
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:01.087
And there were two critical findings.
这个研究有两个重要的发现。

212
00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:07.095
First, a sizable and significant 711 genes
首先，一个数量相当大且 显著的711个基因的活动

213
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.447
were distorted in their activity,
因为缺乏睡眠

214
00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:10.914
caused by a lack of sleep.
而被打乱。

215
00:13:11.743 --> 00:13:14.870
The second result was that about half of those genes
第二个结果是一半的这些基因

216
00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:17.337
were actually increased in their activity.
活动确实增加了。

217
00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:19.591
The other half were decreased.
另一半则减少了。

218
00:13:20.268 --> 00:13:23.549
Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep
因睡眠不足而关闭的基因

219
00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:27.062
were genes associated with your immune system,
是跟你免疫系统相关的基因，

220
00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:29.926
so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.
所以再一次，你会看到免疫缺陷。

221
00:13:31.168 --> 00:13:34.241
In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated
相反，那些因睡眠缺乏而上调

222
00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:36.637
or increased by way of a lack of sleep,
或者活动增加的基因，

223
00:13:36.661 --> 00:13:40.559
were genes associated with the promotion of tumors,
是那些促进肿瘤相关的基因，

224
00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:45.734
genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body,
与体内长期慢性炎症相关的基因，

225
00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:48.560
and genes associated with stress,
与压力相关的基因，

226
00:13:48.584 --> 00:13:51.613
and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.
还有因此导致心血管疾病 相关的基因。

227
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.651
There is simply no aspect of your wellness
你的健康没有任何方面

228
00:13:56.675 --> 00:13:59.942
that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation
可以在睡眠不足的迹象下

229
00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:01.780
and get away unscathed.
安然无恙。

230
00:14:02.732 --> 00:14:05.740
It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home.
这很像你家中的水管破了。

231
00:14:05.764 --> 00:14:09.407
Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny
睡眠不足会渗透到你身体的

232
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.817
of your physiology,
每一个角落，

233
00:14:11.841 --> 00:14:15.746
even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet
甚至会篡改你日常健康状况

234
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.610
that spells out your daily health narrative.
的DNA核酸字母表。

235
00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:24.369
And at this point, you may be thinking,
此刻，你可能在想，

236
00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:26.925
"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep?
“老天，我怎样才能得到更好的睡眠？

237
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.194
What are you tips for good sleep?"
你有没有睡个好觉的提示？”

238
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.378
Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact
除了避免酒精和咖啡因

239
00:14:34.402 --> 00:14:37.321
of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,
对睡眠的有害影响之外，

240
00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:39.782
and if you're struggling with sleep at night,
如果你晚上睡眠不好，

241
00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:41.987
avoiding naps during the day,
白天避免打盹，

242
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:44.154
I have two pieces of advice for you.
我有两点建议给你。

243
00:14:44.924 --> 00:14:47.738
The first is regularity.
首先是规律。

244
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:51.163
Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time,
准时上床，准时醒来，

245
00:14:51.187 --> 00:14:54.248
no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.
不管是工作日还是周末。

246
00:14:54.272 --> 00:14:57.017
Regularity is king,
规律为王，

247
00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:59.002
and it will anchor your sleep
它会固定你的睡眠

248
00:14:59.026 --> 00:15:02.338
and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.
并且提升你睡眠的数量和质量。

249
00:15:04.192 --> 00:15:06.874
The second is keep it cool.
第二点是保持凉爽。

250
00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:10.335
Your body needs to drop its core temperature
你的身体需要把核心温度

251
00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:14.572
by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep
降低2到3华氏度来开始睡眠

252
00:15:14.596 --> 00:15:16.676
and then to stay asleep,
和保持睡眠，

253
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.192
and it's the reason you will always find it easier
这也是为什么你会发现

254
00:15:19.216 --> 00:15:21.597
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold
冷的环境要比热的环境

255
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.865
than too hot.
容易入睡。

256
00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:27.349
So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees,
所以卧室的稳定要控制 在65华氏度左右，

257
00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:29.327
or about 18 degrees Celsius.
或者大约摄氏18度。

258
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:32.118
That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people.
这是大多数人睡眠的最佳选择。

259
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:37.763
And then finally, in taking a step back, then,
然后最终，退一步说，

260
00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:40.980
what is the mission-critical statement here?
这里的关键任务是什么？

261
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.807
Well, I think it may be this:
我想也许是这个：

262
00:15:44.831 --> 00:15:50.103
sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.
不幸的是，睡眠并不是一个 可选的奢侈的生活方式。

263
00:15:50.925 --> 00:15:55.472
Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.
睡眠是一个不容置疑的生理需要。

264
00:15:56.712 --> 00:16:00.303
It is your life-support system,
它是你的生命支持系统，

265
00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:04.961
and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality.
它是自然母亲对永生做的最大努力。

266
00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:11.045
And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations
工业化国家睡眠量的大量减少

267
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:16.286
is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness,
对我们的健康，我们的 幸福，甚至安全

268
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.976
even the safety and the education of our children.
以及孩子的教育有灾难性的影响。

269
00:16:20.143 --> 00:16:23.159
It's a silent sleep loss epidemic,
这是一种无声的睡眠缺乏流行病，

270
00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:26.548
and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges
它正在快速成为我们在 21世纪面临的其中一个

271
00:16:26.572 --> 00:16:29.294
that we face in the 21st century.
公众健康的最大挑战。

272
00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:37.197
I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right
我认为现在是重申我们睡好整夜

273
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:38.692
to a full night of sleep,
权利的时候了，

274
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.989
and without embarrassment
放下尴尬

275
00:16:42.013 --> 00:16:45.412
or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.
和懒惰的耻辱。

276
00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:52.442
And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life,
通过这样做，我们可以与生命中 最强大的长生不老药

277
00:16:53.858 --> 00:16:56.561
the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were.
——瑞士军刀重聚。

278
00:16:58.487 --> 00:17:01.131
And with that soapbox rant over,
说完这番激昂的演说，

279
00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:03.250
I will simply say, good night, good luck,
我只想说，晚安，祝你好运，

280
00:17:03.274 --> 00:17:04.424
and above all ...
最重要的是…

281
00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:08.471
I do hope you sleep well.
我真希望你们睡得好。

282
00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.853
Thank you very much indeed.
衷心感谢各位。

283
00:17:09.877 --> 00:17:14.408
(Applause)
（掌声）

284
00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:15.590
Thank you.
谢谢。

Thank you so much.
非常感谢。

287
00:17:20.047 --> 00:17:22.790
David Biello: No, no, no. Stay there for a second.
大卫·比洛:别，别，别，呆一会儿。

288
00:17:22.814 --> 00:17:25.366
Good job not running away, though. I appreciate that.
还好没走开，我感激这点。

289
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.634
So that was terrifying.
那真是很可怕。

290
00:17:26.658 --> 00:17:29.754
Matt Walker: You're welcome. DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.
马特·沃克：不客气。 大卫·比洛：谢谢，谢谢。

291
00:17:30.134 --> 00:17:35.310
Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do?
马特·沃克：既然我们睡不着，我们应该做什么？

292
00:17:35.334 --> 00:17:38.866
What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night
当我们晚上在床上辗转反侧， 轮班工作或因为其他事情时，

293
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.952
or doing shift work or whatever else?
我们应该做什么？

294
00:17:41.976 --> 00:17:44.317
MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep.
你说的对，我们睡不着。

295
00:17:44.341 --> 00:17:45.666
Sleep is not like the bank.
睡眠不像银行。

296
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.730
You can't accumulate a debt
你不能欠点债，

297
00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:50.446
and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time.
然后希望在后面晚些时候还清。

298
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.614
I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic
我还应该指出，这个如此灾难性的，

299
00:17:53.638 --> 00:17:56.692
and that our health deteriorates so quickly,
我们的健康恶化得如此之快的原因，

300
00:17:56.716 --> 00:17:59.453
first, it's because human beings are the only species
首先，这是因为人类是唯一

301
00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:01.955
that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep
故意无缘无故剥夺自己睡眠

302
00:18:01.979 --> 00:18:04.368
for no apparent reason.
的物种。

303
00:18:04.392 --> 00:18:05.544
DB: Because we're smart.
大卫·比洛：因为我们很聪明。

304
00:18:05.568 --> 00:18:10.393
MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature,
马特·沃克：我提出这一点是因为这意味着大自然母亲，

305
00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:12.107
throughout the course of evolution,
在整个进化过程中，

306
00:18:12.131 --> 00:18:16.434
has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation.
从来没有面临过剥夺睡眠的挑战。

307
00:18:17.115 --> 00:18:20.527
So she's never developed a safety net,
所以她从来没有建立安全网，

308
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:22.679
and that's why when you undersleep,
所以这就是为什么当你睡眠不足时，

309
00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:27.037
things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body.
大脑和身体内部会奔溃得如此之快。

310
00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:29.834
So you just have to prioritize.
所以你只需要分清轻重缓急，

311
00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:33.160
DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed,
大卫·比洛：但在床上辗转反侧时，

312
00:18:33.184 --> 00:18:34.595
what do I do?
我该做什么？

313
00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:39.238
MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long,
马特·沃克：如果你在床上醒着太久，

314
00:18:39.262 --> 00:18:42.515
you should get out of bed and go to a different room
你应该下床，去另一个房间

315
00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:43.852
and do something different.
去做些不一样的事情。

316
00:18:43.876 --> 00:18:48.197
The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom
原因是你的大脑会很快把你的卧室

317
00:18:48.221 --> 00:18:50.540
with the place of wakefulness,
和清醒的地方联系起来，

318
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:53.253
and you need to break that association.
你需要打破这个联系。

319
00:18:53.277 --> 00:18:56.174
So only return to bed when you are sleepy,
所以只在你想睡的时候回到床上，

320
00:18:56.198 --> 00:18:59.737
and that way you will relearn the association that you once had,
这样你就会重新学习你曾经拥有的联系，

321
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:02.269
which is your bed is the place of sleep.
也就是你的床就是你睡觉的地方。

322
00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:03.952
So the analogy would be,
这就类比像

323
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:07.552
you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry,
你永远不要坐在餐桌前等待饥饿。

324
00:19:07.576 --> 00:19:10.539
so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy?
那么为什么要躺在床上等待入睡呢？

325
00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:13.368
DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.
大卫·比洛：谢谢你的提醒。

326
00:19:13.392 --> 00:19:14.561
Great job, Matt.
好样的，马特。

327
00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:16.781
MW: You're very welcome. Thank you very much.
马特·沃克：不客气，谢谢大家。
