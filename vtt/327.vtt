00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:15.992
The most complex problems in our time
现如今，只要有梦想，

2
00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:22.811
can be solved with simple techniques, if we are able to dream.
就可以用最简单的手段解决最复杂的问题。

3
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:27.772
As a child, I discovered that creativity is the key
在孩童时期，我发现让梦想照进现实的关键，

4
00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:32.189
to cross from dreams to reality.
在于创造力。

5
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.404
I learned this from my grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer,
我是从我的外祖母，Ruth Tichauer博士那里学到的，

6
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.768
a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes.
她是居住在安第斯山脉深处的一位犹太难民。

7
00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:46.238
That is how I grew up:
在我成长的一路上，

8
00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:49.585
encouraged to see beyond any limitation.
外祖母总是鼓励我超越自己的极限。

9
00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:57.660
So part of my education included helping her in remote, indigenous communities.
我的一部分教育来自于在遥远的当地部落帮她做事的经历。

10
00:00:57.684 --> 00:00:59.909
I cherish those memories,
我非常珍惜这些经历，

11
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:05.703
because they helped me to understand life outside the city,
因为它们帮我了解了城市以外的生活，

12
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.214
a life with a lot of possibilities,
那种生活有无限可能，

13
00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:13.103
without barriers, as language or culture.
没有语言或文化的障碍。

14
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.926
During those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem:
在那些旅途当中，外祖母曾经背过吉普林的一首诗：

15
00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:22.092
"Something hidden. Go and find it.
“出发吧，去寻觅隐藏的宝藏。

16
00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.774
Go and look behind the Mountains.
去山川背后寻找。

17
00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:28.553
Something lost behind the mountains.
那些宝藏遗失在山川背后，

18
00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.314
Lost and waiting for you. Go!"
正在等待你的发掘。出发吧！”

19
00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:36.735
In the coming years, I became a medical student.
后来几年，我去了医学院读书。

20
00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:46.290
One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease.
我得知，世界上每一百个新生儿中就会有一个患有某种心脏疾病。

21
00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:52.184
There's a part of this problem I think I can solve --
我认为这是个我有能力去帮助治愈的疾病——

22
00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:58.755
the part of this problem I have spent my life working on.
事实上，我一生都致力于这项研究。

23
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:03.456
The problem starts during pregnancy.
这个疾病产生于怀孕期间。

24
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.437
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother.
胎儿是否能够在母亲腹中存活，

25
00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.639
Survival depends on communication
取决于血液在

26
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.080
between the systemic and the pulmonary blood.
体循环与肺循环间的交换。

27
00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:18.156
At the moment of birth,
胎儿出生时，

28
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:21.127
this communication needs to stop.
这一交换必须停止。

29
00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:26.392
If it doesn't close, the baby has a hole in the heart.
如果未能停止，婴儿就会出现先天性心脏缺损。

30
00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:31.440
It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions.
这个问题多由早产及遗传因素引发。

31
00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:35.352
But what we know today
但如今我们发现，

32
00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:39.797
is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes.
缺氧也会引发这一疾病。

33
00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.064
As you can see in the chart,
在图中可以看到，

34
00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:48.183
the frequency of this kind of hole
随着海拔的增高，

35
00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.167
dramatically increases with altitude.
这种病出现的频率也大幅增加。

36
00:02:52.147 --> 00:02:55.279
Video: (Baby crying)
视频：（婴儿哭声）

37
00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:59.445
When you look at patients with this condition,
先天性心脏缺损的患者

38
00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.726
they seem desperate to breathe.
难以正常呼吸。

39
00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:07.544
To close the hole, major surgery used to be the only solution.
过去，我们只能通过大手术来修复这一缺损。

40
00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:13.338
One night, my friend Malte, were camping in the Amazon region.
有一天，我和我朋友Malte在亚马逊流域露营。

41
00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:20.381
The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch.
我们发现唯一不能被火点燃的东西是绿鳄梨的树枝。

42
00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:23.635
Then came a moment of inspiration.
这时我们有了一个灵感。

43
00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:28.520
So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention.
我们利用这种枝条设计出了一个器材雏形。

44
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.924
The holes in children's hearts can be closed with it.
它可以修补儿童心脏上的缺损。

45
00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.583
A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself.
这是一种螺旋体缠绕的结构。

46
00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.556
It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,
也许对你们而言这并不稀奇，

47
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.349
but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem.
但它却是我们修补心脏的首次成功尝试。

48
00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:52.628
In this video, we can see how a very tiny catheter
这个视频演示了微型导管将螺旋体

49
00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:54.781
takes the coil to the heart.
植入心脏的过程。

50
00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:57.517
The coil then closes the hole.
之后，螺旋体修补了漏洞。

51
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.346
After that moment of inspiration,
经由这一灵感启发，

52
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.528
there came a very long time of effort
我们通过相当长时间的努力，

53
00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:08.291
developing a prototype.
研发出了一种器材原型。

54
00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:13.904
In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab.
我们在实验室里进行了上千小时的体外实验及研究。

55
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:18.730
The coil, if it works, can save lives.
这种螺旋体一旦成功植入，就能挽救生命。

56
00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:22.434
I returned from Germany to Bolivia,
我从德国返回波利尼亚，

57
00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.962
thinking that wherever we go,
想着无论我们去哪，

58
00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:28.334
we have the opportunity to make a difference.
都有机会实现重大突破。

59
00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:33.598
With my wife and partner, Dr. Alexandra Heath,
我和我妻子，也是我的合作伙伴Alexandra Heath博士

60
00:04:33.622 --> 00:04:35.288
we started to see patients.
一起开始接诊。

61
00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:39.613
After successfully treating patients with our coil,
在成功地用螺旋体治愈患者后，

62
00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:42.102
we felt really enthusiastic.
我们感到非常激动。

63
00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:49.856
But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high.
但我们住在海拔3600多米的地方。

64
00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:52.689
And,
而且，

65
00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:59.705
the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition.
那里的病人们需要一种特别的器材来解决他们的心脏问题。

66
00:04:59.685 --> 00:05:02.148
The hole in altitude patients is different,
高海拔地区病人的心脏缺损不同于其他地区，

67
00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:05.842
because the orifice between the arteries is larger.
因为他们的动脉孔径更大。

68
00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:11.201
Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time,
绝大多数患者因得不到及时治疗，

69
00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.406
and they die.
最终不幸去世。

70
00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:17.412
The first coil could successfully treat
我们的第一代螺旋体只能成功救治

71
00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:21.612
only half of the patients in Bolivia.
玻利维亚一半的患者。

72
00:05:23.397 --> 00:05:25.798
The search started again.
于是我们又从零开始

73
00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:30.640
We went back to the drawing board.
寻找新的材料。

74
00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:32.827
After many trials,
多次试验无果后，

75
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:37.874
and with the help of my grandmother's indigenous friends in the mountains,
我在外祖母在山区的原住民朋友的帮助下，

76
00:05:37.898 --> 00:05:39.970
we obtained a new device.
获得了一种新的器材。

77
00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:47.616
For centuries, indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms,
几个世纪以来，原住民妇女在织布机上织出了各种复杂的图案，

78
00:05:48.082 --> 00:05:52.398
and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device.
我们从这种传统织布工艺上得出灵感。

79
00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:56.303
We take this traditional method of weaving

82
00:06:03.056 --> 00:06:05.551
It seems this time,

83
00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:10.302
the weaving allows us to create a seamless device
织布技术似乎帮我们造出了一种无缝器材，

84
00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:12.099
that doesn't rust

85
00:06:12.892 --> 00:06:16.406
because it's made of only one piece.
因为它是一体化的，没有接缝。

86
00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:21.727
It can change by itself into very complex structures

87
00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:25.692
by a procedure that took decades to develop.

89
00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:31.128
through the natural channels.
大型切口就可以进入人体。

90
00:06:31.993 --> 00:06:35.283
Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole.
医生只需要在穿过心脏缺损的部分后关闭导管。

91
00:06:35.924 --> 00:06:38.768
Our device expands, places itself
我们的这种器材会自动膨大并找准位置，

92
00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:40.267
and closes the hole.
紧接着修复心脏缺损。

93
00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:47.179
We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use
这种放置方式极为简单，

94
00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:49.353
