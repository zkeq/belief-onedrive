35
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.980
So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus.
我一直对海马体非常着迷。

36
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.276
How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.516
Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain.
原因一：它对你的大脑有 立刻的影响。

127
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.556
A single workout that you do

128
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.196
will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters

And finally, studies have shown
最后，研究还显示，

136
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.716
that a single workout will improve your reaction times
运动本身可以提高你的反应时间

137
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.996
which basically means
这意味着

138

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.916
(Laughter)
（笑声）

142
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.860
But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after.

143
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.356
What you have to do is do what I did,
你所需要做的是像我一样，

144
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.396
that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function,
改变你的锻炼习惯， 增强你的心肺功能，

145
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.756
to get the long-lasting effects.
来取得长期的效果。

146
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.036
And these effects are long-lasting
这些效果之所以能够长期有用

147
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.476
because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy,
是因为运动改变了大脑的解剖结构，

148
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500
physiology and function.
生理机能和功能。

149
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.420
Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus.
让我们从我最喜欢的大脑区域开始， 海马体。

150
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.556
The hippocampus --
海马体——

151
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.036
or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells,
或者说是运动实际上 能够产生全新的脑细胞，

152
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.716
new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume,
海马体中的全新脑细胞能够增加它的数量，

153
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.076
as well as improve your long-term memory, OK?
同时提升你的长期记忆力。

154
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.540
And that including in you and me.
这些对你我都适用。

155
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.836
Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies,
原因二： 在神经科学研究中最常见的发现

156
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.476
looking at effects of long-term exercise,
是长期运动的影响

157
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.876
is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex.
它能够单独提升你的注意力 或是你的前额皮层。

158
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.356
You not only get better focus and attention,
你不仅能够得到更好的专注力，

159
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.956
but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well.
同时也增加了你的海马体数量。

160
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.956
And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise
最后一点是你不仅能够 获得即时的愉悦心情

161
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.636
but those last for a long time.
这种情绪还能够维持较长的时间。

162
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.020
So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters.
所以你获得的是能够长期存在的 情绪转化神经元。

163
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.316
But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do
但实际上，运动所做的 最具变革意义的事情是

164
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.516
is its protective effects on your brain.
它对于大脑的保护作用。

165
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.396
Here you can think about the brain like a muscle.
你可以将大脑想象成是一块肌肉。

166
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.076
The more you're working out,
你运动的越多，

167
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.940
the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets.
你的海马体和前额皮层 就越大越强壮。

168
00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.756
Why is that important?
为什么这一点很重要呢？

169
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.556
Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus
因为前额皮层和海马体

170
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:07.356
are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases
是最易神经退化疾病影响的两个区域

171
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.300
and normal cognitive decline in aging.
并容易随着年龄增长认知能力下降。

172
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.956
So with increased exercise over your lifetime,
所以增加运动量，

173
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.116
you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease,
你不仅能够预防痴呆和 阿兹海默综合症，

174
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.636
but what you're going to do is you're going to create
你更能够创造

175
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.316
the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
最强壮有力的海马体和前额皮层

176
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.780
so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect.
所以能够更有效低于这些疾病。

177
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.156
You can think of exercise, therefore,
因此，你可以把运动想象成是

178
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.596
as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK?
为你的大脑额外提供的401退休金计划， 对不对？

179
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.500
And it's even better, because it's free.
而且更棒的是，它是免费的。

180
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.596
So this is the point in the talk where everybody says,
所以重点来了，大家都会说，

181
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.756
"That sounds so interesting, Wendy,
“这听起来很不错啊，温蒂，

182
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.316
but I really will only want to know one thing.
但我事实上只想知道一件事。

183
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.236
And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise
告诉我吧，运动的最低量是多少

184
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.116
I need to get all these changes."

185
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.156
(Laughter)
（笑声）

186
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.996
And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question.
我马上就会给出答案。

187
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.316
First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects.
首先，好消息是：你不需要参加 铁人三项才能获得这些改变。

188
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.876
The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise
首要的原则是你需每周运动三到四次

189
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.316
minimum 30 minutes an exercise session,
每次最低30分钟，

190
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.996
and you want to get aerobic exercise in.
要包含有氧运动。

191
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.996
That is, get your heart rate up.
这样能够让你的心率加快。

192
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.516
And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym
还有一个好消息是你不需要走进健身房

193
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.556
to get a very expensive gym membership.
来办一张昂贵的会员卡。

194
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.276
Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk.

195
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.756
You see stairs -- take stairs.

196
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.876
And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class
这些能量的聚集和有氧课程是一样的

197
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.780
that you were going to take at the gym.
就像你在健身房上的一样。

198
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.676
So I've gone from memory pioneer
所以我从记忆先锋

199
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.476
to exercise explorer.
变成了运动探索者。

200
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.316
From going into the innermost workings of the brain,

201
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.556
to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function,

205
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.716
I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.636
But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it.
但是知易行难，

212
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.396
So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor,
