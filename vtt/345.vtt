00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.392
So I know TED is about a lot of things that are big,
我知道 TED 总是谈一些大事

2
00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.946
but I want to talk to you about something very small.
但是我想讲一件微不足道的小事

3
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.128
So small, it's a single word.
小到只有一个词

4
00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:24.469
The word is "misfit."
“异类。”

5
00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.786
It's one of my favorite words, because it's so literal.
这是我最喜欢的词，因为简单明了

6
00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:33.169
I mean, it's a person who sort of missed fitting in.
这样的人是一个无法融入，

7
00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:35.868
Or a person who fits in badly.
或者融入得很差的人，

8
00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:42.293
Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments."

9
00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:45.340
I'm a card-carrying misfit.
我是真正的异类。

10
00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:48.960
And I'm here for the other misfits in the room,
我代表这里的所有异类站在这里，

11
00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:50.795
because I'm never the only one.

12
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:53.700
I'm going to tell you a misfit story.
我将讲述一个异类的故事。

13
00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:57.589
Somewhere in my early 30s,
在我三十岁出头的时候，

14
00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:01.175
the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep.
成为作家的梦想在向我招手。

15
00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:03.622
Actually, it came to my mailbox
准确地说我在我的邮箱里

16
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:09.254
in the form of a letter that said I'd won a giant literary prize for a short story I had written.
发现了一封信，信上说我写的小说为我赢得了一份大奖。

17
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:16.507
The short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer and about my crappy home life,
小说讲述了 一名历经糟糕的家庭生活的优秀的游泳运动员的故事，

18
00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:21.975
and a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane.
还有一些关于悲痛和困惑如何让人抓狂的情节。

19
00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.670
The prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents and other authors.
赢得的奖励是去纽约和知名的编辑、代理和其他作家见面。

20
00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:33.162
So kind of it was the wannabe writer's dream, right?
这是每个作家的梦想，对吧？

21
00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.233
You know what I did the day the letter came to my house?
各位知道我看到信后做了什么吗？

22
00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:39.655
Because I'm me,
因为我是不适者，

23
00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.876
I put the letter on my kitchen table,
我把信放在厨房桌子上，

24
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.112
I poured myself a giant glass of vodka with ice and lime,
给自己倒了一大杯加了冰和柠檬的伏特加，

25
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:54.852
and I sat there in my underwear for an entire day, just staring at the letter.
就这样穿着内衣看着那封信坐了一整天。

26
00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:59.573
I was thinking about all the ways I'd already screwed my life up.
我在考虑以前把我的生活毁了的各种方式。

27
00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:04.525
Who the hell was I to go to New York City and pretend to be a writer?
那个要去纽约装作是一位作家的我到底是谁？

28
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:06.866
Who was I?

29
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.088
I'll tell you.

30
00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:09.732
I was a misfit.
我是一个异类。

31
00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:12.808
Like legions of other children,
就像千千万万其他的孩子，

32
00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:16.096
I came from an abusive household
我来自一个受虐待的家庭，

33
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.776
that I narrowly escaped with my life.
只不过我侥幸逃脱了。

34
00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:24.038
I already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt.
在我的生命中已经经历了两次婚姻的大失败。

35
00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:27.028
I'd flunked out of college not once but twice
我考大学失败了两次，

36
00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:30.244
and maybe even a third time that I'm not going to tell you about.
也许会有第三次我不会告诉你们的。

37
00:02:30.268 --> 00:02:32.078
(Laughter)
（笑声）

38
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:36.063
And I'd done an episode of rehab for drug use.
我还有一段戒毒的美妙经历。

39
00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:41.065
And I'd had two lovely staycations in jail.
我还在监狱里度过两次假。

40
00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:43.952
So I'm on the right stage.
所以我应该站在这里。

41
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.590
(Laughter)
（笑声）

42
00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:52.057
But the real reason, I think, I was a misfit,
但是我想，真正的原因是我是一个异类。

43
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.343
is that my daughter died the day she was born,
我的女儿在出生的那天就去世了，

44
00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.486
and I hadn't figured out how to live with that story yet.
我当时根本无法接受这件事。

45
00:03:00.053 --> 00:03:05.180
After my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless,

46
00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.148
living under an overpass

00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:13.928
in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way.
那种无尽的悲痛和困惑是很多人一生中都会遇到的。

48
00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:16.683
Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.
如果活得够久也许所有人都会遇到。

49
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.057
You know, homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits,
无家可归的人是我们之中最伟大的异类，

50
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:25.177
because they start out as us.
因为从那时起他们就成为了我这样的人。

51
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.908
So you see, I'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there:
可以看到我与所有的生活格格不入：

52
00:03:31.932 --> 00:03:36.400
daughter, wife, mother, scholar.
作为女儿，作为妻子，作为妈妈，作为学者。

53
00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:45.258
And the dream of being a writer was really kind of like a small, sad stone in my throat.
而想要成为作家的梦想也一直如鲠在喉。

54
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.195
It was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane
我没有理会自己的不适就登上了飞机，

55
00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.606
and flew to New York City,

Fellow misfits, I can almost see your heads glowing.

58
00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:00.599
I can pick you out of a room.

At first, you would've loved it.

在那里可以和出色，聪明，华丽的人喝苏格兰威士忌直到深夜。

And you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents

Audience: How fancy?

69
00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:39.810
(Laughter)

70
00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:41.491
from three different restaurants.

I just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home,

I could believe it had really happened to me.

The three writers I wanted to meet

were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan.
卡罗尔·马索，琳恩·蒂尔曼和佩吉·费伦。

78
00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:03.370
These were not famous, best-selling authors,
她们不算是最知名和畅销的作家，

79
00:05:03.394 --> 00:05:06.701
but to me, they were women-writer titans.
但是我把她们奉若神明。

80
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.082
Carole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible.

that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world.

And Peggy Phelan reminded me

that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs.

85
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.004
They weren't mainstream women writers,
她们不是主流女作家，

86
00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:35.162
but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories,
但是她们用自己的故事题材在主流文学中独树一帜，

87
00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:40.249
I like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon.
另辟蹊径。

88
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:46.767
It nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers.
能和这三位50多岁的女作家聊天快把我乐疯了。

89
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:51.810
And the reason it nearly killed me with joy is that I'd never known a joy like that.

90
00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:53.516
I'd never been in a room like that.

My mother never went to college.
我的母亲没有上过大学。

92
00:05:56.567 --> 00:06:03.532
And my creative career to that point was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.
从这一点来说我的创作生涯本来就是一个很小的，卑微的，会胎死腹中的事。

93
00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:08.493
So kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there.
在纽约的前几天我希望就死在那里。

94
00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:11.957
I was just like, "Kill me now. I'm good. This is beautiful."
我想说“杀了我吧。我要葬在这美好之中。”

95
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.155
Some of you in the room will understand what happened next.

First, they took me to the offices of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
首先，他们把我带到了法勒，斯特劳斯和吉鲁的办公室。

97
00:06:21.683 --> 00:06:24.858

法勒，斯特劳斯和吉鲁是我的终极梦想出版社。

98

I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor were published there.
艾略特的诗集和弗兰纳里·奥康纳的小说都在那里出版。

99
00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:33.613
The main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time,
主编让我坐下和我聊了很久，

100
00:06:33.637 --> 00:06:37.684
trying to convince me I had a book in me about my life as a swimmer.
一直在试图让我相信我写了一本关于我自己是游泳运动员的书。

101
00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:39.605
You know, like a memoir.
就像用备忘录让我回忆一样。

102
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.686
The whole time he was talking to me,
整个谈话期间

103
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.415
I sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot,
我双手交叉在胸前不住地微笑和点头，

104
00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:49.181
with my arms crossed over my chest,
却一句话都不说，

105
00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:54.122
while nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat.
麻木的像个傻子。

106
00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:59.062
So in the end, he patted me on the shoulder
最后他像一个游泳教练一样

107
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.667
like a swim coach might.
拍了拍我的肩膀。

108
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.235
And he wished me luck
他祝我好运

109
00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.697
and he gave me some free books

110
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.512
and he showed me out the door.
请我出去了。

111
00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:12.675
Next, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton,
接下来他们让我去W.W.诺顿的办公室，

112
00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:17.312
where I was pretty sure I'd be escorted from the building just for wearing Doc Martens.
我以为穿了马腾斯博士靴的我一定会有人陪同一起过去。

113
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.459

114
00:07:20.332 --> 00:07:22.761
Being at the Norton offices
在诺顿的办公室里

115
00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:27.257
felt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon
就像身处洪荒，摘星揽月

116
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.918
while the stars stitched your name across the cosmos.
群星闪烁在无尽的宇宙中编织着我的名字。

117
00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.564
I mean, that's how big a deal it was to me.
这是我人生中多么重大的一件事啊。

118
00:07:33.588 --> 00:07:34.769

Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,

120
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:42.252
leaned over right in my face with these beady, bright, fierce eyes
靠在我面前闪烁着有神，明亮，犀利的目光

and said, "Well, send me something then, immediately!"

See, now most people, especially TED people,

123
00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:50.804
would have run to the mailbox, right?

124
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.749
It took me over a decade to even imagine

125
00:07:54.773 --> 00:07:58.650
putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp.
要不要做这件事。

126
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:02.135
On the last night,

127
00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:05.428
I gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club.

I stood there and I kind of went deaf.

134
00:08:25.523 --> 00:08:27.635

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:31.584
because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully,
因为所有屋子里的人都如此华丽

136
00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:34.761
and all that came out of my mouth was:

137
00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:37.895
"I don't know. I have to think about it."
“我不知道，我要再想想”那样的话。

138
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:42.917
And she said, "OK, then," and walked away.

00:08:44.704 --> 00:08:51.223
All those open hands out to me, that small, sad stone in my throat ...
尽管很多人伸来了橄榄枝我仍然如鲠在喉

140
00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:55.185
You see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me.
各位，我尽量告诉大家像我这样的人的感受。

Misfit people -- we don't always know how to hope or say yes

142
00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:00.897
or choose the big thing,

143
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:03.067
even when it's right in front of us.

144
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:04.710
It's a shame we carry.

146
00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:08.741
It's the shame of feeling something good.
这是想感受美好时就会有的耻辱。

147
00:09:08.765 --> 00:09:13.147

这种耻辱让我们不敢相信我们应该和那些我们敬仰的人

148
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:15.288
with the people we admire.
站在同一个屋檐下。

149
00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:19.218
If I could, I'd go back and I'd coach myself.
如果可以回到过去我要像那些

150
00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:23.585
I'd be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me.

I'd teach myself how to want things,

how to stand up, how to ask for them.

I'd say, "You! Yeah, you! You belong in the room, too."
我会跟我自己说：“你！就是你！你应该在这个屋子里。”

154
00:09:32.228 --> 00:09:37.435
The radiance falls on all of us, and we are nothing without each other.
只有和大家团结在一起，每个人才是光芒四射的。

155
00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:42.133
Instead, I flew back to Oregon,
可现实是，我飞回了俄勒冈，

156
00:09:42.157 --> 00:09:47.849
and as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view,
看着窗外的雨拍打着常青树

157
00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:52.165
I just drank many tiny bottles of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."
我不禁借酒浇愁。

158
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:58.153
I thought about how, if I was a writer, I was some kind of misfit writer.

of having sat so near the beautiful writers.

Memory was the only prize I allowed myself.

165
00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:20.124
And yet, at home in the dark,

166
00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:22.655
back in my underwear,
穿回我的内衣，

I could still hear their voices.

她们说：“不要让任何试图让你闭嘴的人改变你的故事。”

她们说：“有时候写书可以改变你的一生。”

called "The Chronology of Water."
