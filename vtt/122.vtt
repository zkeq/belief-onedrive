That's "Jonny" but spelled accidentally with an "m,"
我解释一下，应该叫"Jonny"，

5
00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:23.713
in case you were wondering,
但是"n"不小心拼成了"m"，

6
00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.213
because we're not all perfect.
人无完人嘛。

7
00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:27.254

Jomny is feeling lost and alone and far from home,

10
00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:37.463
and I think we've all felt this way.

11
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:39.254
Or, at least I have.

I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life

13
00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:44.338
when I was feeling particularly alien.
于是写下了这个外星人的故事。

14
00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.629
I had just moved to Cambridge and started my doctoral program at MIT,
那时我才搬到剑桥， 刚开始我的MIT博士课程，

15
00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:53.463
and I was feeling intimidated and isolated and very much like I didn't belong.

16
00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.588

and sharing them on social media,

and I found that I was turning to doing this more and more.
而且随着孤独感的增加， 我分享的笑话越来越多。

20

Now, for many people, the internet can feel like a lonely place.
我知道对很多人而言， 网络是个孤独的地方。

21
00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.463
It can feel like this,
就像这里一样，

22
00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:14.254
a big, endless, expansive void
宽广、无穷的一片空虚。

23
00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:17.487
where you can constantly call out to it but no one's ever listening.
你可以在这里大声呼喊， 但没人听到。

24
00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.004
But I actually found a comfort in speaking out to the void.

25
00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:24.463
I found, in sharing my feelings with the void,

26
00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:26.737
eventually the void started to speak back.
我得到了空虚的回应。

27
00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:31.629
And it turns out that the void isn't this endless lonely expanse at all,
我发现这片空虚， 其实并非无穷孤寂的空间，

28
00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:34.088
but instead it's full of all sorts of other people,
而是充满着不同的人，

29
00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:37.421
also staring out into it and also wanting to be heard.
这些人也在望着这片空虚， 并且希望自己的心声得到回应。

30
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:41.213
Now, there have been many bad things that have come from social media.
确实，社交网络上充斥着不良信息。

31
00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:43.088
I'm not trying to dispute that at all.

32
00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:47.004
To be online at any given point is to feel so much sadness

and anger and violence.

It can feel like the end of the world.

35
00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:53.088
Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted
但同时，我也很矛盾，

36
00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.754
because I can't deny the fact that so many of my closest friends
因为我也无法否认， 我许多特别亲近的朋友，

37
00:01:56.778 --> 00:01:59.403
are people that I had met originally online.
都是通过网络认识的。

38
00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:03.546
And I think that's partly because there's this confessional nature
我觉得其中一部分原因，

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.820
to social media.
是社交网络的自白属性。

40
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.463
It can feel like you are writing in this personal, intimate diary
在网络写非常私人、 亲密的日记，

41

that's completely private,

yet at the same time you want everyone in the world to read it.
但同时你又希望 全世界的人都能读到。

43
00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:17.046
And I think part of that, the joy of that
我认为，在其中有一些乐趣，

44
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.296
is that we get to experience things from perspectives from people
那就是我们可以从跟自己完全不同

45
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.379
who are completely different from ourselves,
的人的视角，去体验，

46
00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:24.046
and sometimes that's a nice thing.
而有些时候，这种体验是好的。

47
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.046
For example, when I first joined Twitter,
比如，我最初加入推特时，

48
00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:28.941
I found that so many of the people that I was following

49
00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:31.629
were talking about mental health and going to therapy

50
00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:35.046
in ways that had none of the stigma that they often do

51
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.588
when we talk about these issues in person.
往往没有面对面探讨 面临的种种困难。

52
00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:41.254
Through them, the conversation around mental health was normalized,

53
00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:44.296
and they helped me realize that going to therapy was something
他们也帮我认识到，

54
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.921
that would help me as well.
咨询心理医生也可以帮助到我。

55
00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:47.754
Now, for many people,
我知道对许多人来说，

56
00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:52.254
it sounds like a scary idea to be talking about all these topics
在网络上公开、毫不保留地 探讨这些话题

57
00:02:52.278 --> 00:02:55.171
so publicly and so openly on the internet.
想想就很恐怖。

58
00:02:55.195 --> 00:03:00.004
I feel like a lot of people think that it is a big, scary thing
许多人认为，如果你本身 不是一个完美、健全的人，

59
00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:04.171
to be online if you're not already perfectly and fully formed.
那在网上就是一件 很恐怖的事情。

60
00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:07.588
But I think the internet can be actually a great place to not know,
但我认为，网络上的 这种未知是好的，

61
00:03:07.612 --> 00:03:11.588
and I think we can treat that with excitement,
我们可以用一种 新奇的心态看待它，

62
00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:16.213
because to me there's something important about sharing your imperfections

63
00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:19.379
and your insecurities and your vulnerabilities

64
00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:20.695
with other people.
也是必要的。

65
00:03:20.703 --> 00:03:23.671
(Laughter)
【我就像一颗洋葱，一层层拨开以后， 是一个更渺小、更胆怯的洋葱】

66
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:27.254
Now, when someone shares that they feel sad or afraid
当他人分享他们的悲伤、害怕，

67
00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:28.963
or alone, for example,
或是孤独的时候，

68
00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:31.129
it actually makes me feel less alone,

00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:34.254
not by getting rid of any of my loneliness

in feeling lonely.

And as a writer and as an artist,

73
00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:43.546
I care very much about making this comfort of being vulnerable

74
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.992
a communal thing, something that we can share with each other.

75
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.338
I'm excited about externalizing the internal,

76

about taking those invisible personal feelings that I don't have words for,

holding them to the light, putting words to them,

and then sharing them with other people

79
00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:02.493

80
00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:04.879
Now, I know that sounds like a big thing,
我知道这些话很大，

81
00:04:04.903 --> 00:04:07.588
but ultimately I'm interested in putting all these things

82
00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:10.129
into small, approachable packages,
分成小而易懂的小事，

83
00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:12.796
because when we can hide them into these smaller pieces,

84
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.754
I think they are easier to approach, I think they're more fun.
这样就更方便理解，也更有趣。

85
00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:18.093
I think they can more easily help us see our shared humanness.

Sometimes that takes the form of a short story,

sometimes that takes the form of a cute book of illustrations, for example.

of a silly joke that I'll throw on the internet.
我网上发布的傻乎乎的笑话。

90
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:32.337
For example, a few months ago, I posted this app idea

91
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.296
for a dog-walking service

93
00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:38.921

94
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.820
(Laughter)
（笑）

95
00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:44.296
If there are app developers in the audience,

96
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.778
please find me after the talk.
等会儿我们可以聊一聊。

97
00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:50.296
Or, I like to share every time I feel anxious about sending an email.

98
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.754
When I sign my emails "Best,"

it's short for "I am trying my best,"

which is short for "Please don't hate me, I promise I'm trying my best!"
全称是“千万别恨我， 我真的尽了最大的努力！”

101
00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:01.046
Or my answer to the classic icebreaker,

if I could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, I would.

And I find that when I post things like these online,
我发现，把这些笑话 在网上发布以后，

106
00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:14.921
the reaction is very similar.

107
00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:16.796

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.838
(Laughter)
（笑声）

111

Yes, leaving me once again alone.
对，我又孤单一人了。

112
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.421
But I think sometimes these little gatherings can be quite meaningful.
不过我认为这些小型聚会 是非常有意义的。

113
00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:33.004
For example, when I graduated from architecture school

114
00:05:33.028 --> 00:05:34.338
and I moved to Cambridge,

to different cities and different countries, even,

120
00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:49.796
and how hard it would be for me to keep in touch with them.

121
00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:53.046
But other people started replying and sharing their own experiences.

122

Somebody talked about a family member they had a falling out with.

00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:07.421
But then something really nice started happening.

128
00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:08.963
Instead of just replying to me,
人们不只回应我的推文，

129
00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:11.379
people started replying to each other,
也开始回应彼此的评论，

130
00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:14.713

And eventually, we got this little tiny microcommunity.

136

It felt like this support group formed

of all sorts of people coming together.

138

And I think every time we post online,

are doing enough to address and to fix that.

I think the inflatable metaphorical bouncy castle in this case

to the lonely darkness.

feels like holding someone's hand at the end of the world."

201

And this time, instead of the void responding,

it was people who showed up,

in the midst of it all,

I think the thing that we have to hold on to is other people.
