1
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:14.838
When we're designing new products,
当我们设计新的产品

2
00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:16.852
services or businesses,
推出新的服务或业务的时候

3
00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:19.394
the only time you'll know if they're any good,
只有当用户真正开始使用它们

4
00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.116
if the designs are good,
我们才能判定

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.875
is to see how they're used in the real world, in context.
这个产品或是服务设计得究竟如何

6
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.979
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London.
我每次路过伦敦北部的海布里公园（Highbury Fields）都会想起这个道理

7
00:00:31.963 --> 00:00:33.285
It's absolutely beautiful.
那个公园非常美

8
00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.042
There's a big open green space.
公园内有一大块草坪

9
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.634
There's Georgian buildings around the side.
格鲁吉亚风格的建筑环绕四周

10
00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:40.556
But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle.
但是草坪中间有一段泥泞小路

11
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.664
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge.
显然，人们不愿意绕一大圈，更喜欢抄近路，

12
00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:47.152
Instead, they want to take the shortcut,
而小路有自我强化机制：

13
00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:49.632
and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.
一旦形成，就会有越来越多的人走

14
00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:53.982
Now, this shortcut is called a desire path,
我们把这类“近路”叫做心仪小路 (desire path)

15
00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.470
and it's often the path of least resistance.
这类小路对于行人来说是最有吸引力的

16
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.863
I find them fascinating,
这些小路让我着迷

17
00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:03.352
because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge.
因为它体现出设计与用户体验往往是有偏差的

18
00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.837
Now at this point, I should apologize,
在此，我应该道歉

19
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:08.733
because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere.
因为此后你们会开始注意到这样的偏差无处不在

20
00:01:08.757 --> 00:01:11.419
But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting
但今天我只挑三个例子与你们分享

21
00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:13.554
and share what actually it reminds me
它们不仅有趣，还会提醒我们

22
00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:16.386
about launching new products and services.
研发新产品、推广新服务时应该注意什么

23
00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:20.620
The first is in the capital city of Brazil -- Brasilia.
第一个例子来自巴西首都——巴西利亚

24
00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.161
And it reminds me that sometimes,
这个例子提醒我

25
00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:27.606
you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction.
设计产品时往往需要关注实际需求以避免不必要的麻烦

26
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:29.584
Now, Brasilia is fascinating.
当下，巴西利亚非常迷人

27
00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:32.750
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.
20世纪50年代尼迈耶对整座城市做了规划

28
00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:34.982
It was the golden age of flying,
那个时候是航空业的黄金时期

29
00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:38.244
so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there.
你可以看出来，他规划出了一个飞机的形状

30
00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:39.459
Slightly worryingly,
不过有些令人担心的是

31
00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:43.231
he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit.
他将大多数重要政府机构都放在了机头的位置

32
00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:45.702
But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia,
但是如果你将巴西利亚市中心航拍图放大

33
00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:47.888
just where the point is there,
就是图中标注的这个位置

34
00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:50.312
you see it's littered with desire paths.
你将看到这里遍布着心仪小路

35
00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:52.866
They're absolutely everywhere.
真的无处不在

36
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.760
Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design.
他们曾觉得这个设计能经受住时间的考验

37
00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:58.799
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --
因为他们认为未来我们不再需要步行了

38
00:01:58.823 --> 00:02:00.371
we'd be able to drive --
我们可以开车

39
00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.352
so there was little need for walkways or pavements.
所以也就不再需要人行道了

40
00:02:04.178 --> 00:02:06.511
But as you can see, there's a real need.
但是你可以看到，人行道还是必要的

41
00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:09.206
These are very dangerous desire paths.
这些心仪小路非常危险

42
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.267
If we just pick one, in the middle,
比如我们看一下中间这条小路

43
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.698
you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic.
如果走这条路，行人需要横穿15个机动车道

44
00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:16.478
It won't surprise you guys
在座各位可能知道

45
00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:21.944
that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city.
在巴西利亚，行人出车祸的概率是在美国的五倍

46
00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:24.275
People are resourceful.
人们都很聪明

47
00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.333
They'll always find the low-friction route
他们总是寻找最便捷的路线

48
00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:29.752
to save money, save time.
既省钱又省时间

49
00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:32.296
Not all these desire paths are dangerous,
但也并不是所有的心仪小路都很危险

50
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.713
I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow.
当我抵达希思罗机场的时候曾注意到

51
00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:38.257
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted
很多乘客对这里的道路设计都很不满

52
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:40.950
with the obligatory walk through duty-free.
因为他们必须从免税店穿过

53
00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:43.995
It was amazing to me
这让我很好奇

54
00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.138
how many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left,
会有多少乘客不走左边这条又长又蜿蜒的路线

55
00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:50.255
and just cut through to the right,
而选择走右边

56
00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.000
cut through the desire path.
走这条心仪小路

57
00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.341
The question that's interesting is:
这个问题有趣的地方在于

58
00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:57.555
What do designers think when they see our behavior here?
设计师是如何看待我们的行为的呢

59
00:02:58.018 --> 00:02:59.809
Do they think we're stupid?
他们会觉得我们傻吗

60
00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.629
Do they think we're lazy?
会觉得我们懒吗

61
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.777
Or do they accept that this is the only truth?
还是他们会承认他们设计失误

62
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:06.559
This is their product.
毕竟，这是他们的设计作品

63
00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.487
We're effectively co-designing their product.
我们这些使用者实际上也参与了产品设计

64
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.286
So our job is to design for real needs at low friction,
所以我们设计师的工作就是尽可能满足用户的实际需求

65
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.206
because if you don't, the customer will, anyway.
因为如果设计师做不到，使用者自己也会想办法的

66
00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:21.278
The second desire path I wanted to share
我想跟大家分享的第二条心仪小路

67
00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.554
is at the University of California.
位于加州大学

68
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.730
And it reminds me
这个例子让我明白

69
00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:29.620
that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it.
有时候最好的设计方式就是顺应用户

70
00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:34.558
Now, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths.
大学校园是寻找心仪小路的理想场合

71
00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:37.920
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.
我觉得这是因为学生总是赶时间而且他们还很聪明

72
00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:39.426
So they're dashing to lectures.
当他们冲向讲座教室时候

73
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.543
They'll always find the shortcut.
他们总能找到近道

74
00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:44.326
And the designers here knew that.
而那里的设计者了解这一点

75
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.323
So they built the buildings
所以他们先建好大楼

76
00:03:46.347 --> 00:03:49.261
and then they waited a few months for the paths to form.
然后等上几个月，直到人们踩出了小路

77
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.174
They then paved them.
然后在此基础上铺路

78
00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:52.237
(Laughter)
(笑声)

79
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:54.166
Incredibly smart approach.
非常聪明的点子

80
00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.662
In fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service
事实上，多数情况，通过类似的前期试验

81
00:03:57.686 --> 00:03:59.827
can teach you what people really want.
设计师即可捕获用户的真正需求

82
00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:04.681
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant.
例如波士顿的 Ayr Muir 想要开一个餐馆

83
00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:06.113
But where should it be?
但是如何选址

84
00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:08.056
What should the menu be?
菜单又应包含哪些菜品呢

85
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.970
He launched a service,
在开餐厅之前

86
00:04:09.994 --> 00:04:11.680
in this case a food truck,
他开了一个快餐车

87
00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:14.079
and he changed the location each day.
然后每天换个地方售卖快餐

88
00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:17.647
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker
他每天也会在餐车的旁边立一块白板上面写有当天的菜单

89
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:19.583
to figure out what people wanted.
以此找出人们喜欢的菜式

90
00:04:20.038 --> 00:04:22.457
He now has a chain of restaurants.
如今他已经拥有多家连锁餐厅了

91
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:27.301
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths.
显然，先做一些实验来找出“心仪小路”的办法极为有效

92
00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:31.134
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you
第三个，也是最后一个我想要分享的心仪小路

93
00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:32.781
is the UNIH.
位于UNIH（美国国立卫生研究院）

94
00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:35.703
It reminds me that the world's in flux,
这个例子提醒我世界不是一成不变的

95
00:04:35.727 --> 00:04:38.027
and we have to respond to those changes.
我们要随时准备应对这些变化

96
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.657
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.
正如你们所料，这是个医院

97
00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:44.198
I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department.
我把左边的肿瘤科标记了出来

98
00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:48.903
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right.
病人通常都呆在图中右下角的宾馆里

99
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.063
This was a patient-centered organization,
这是个以病人为中心的组织

100
00:04:52.087 --> 00:04:54.715
so they laid on cars for their patients.
所以他们为病人提供免费摆渡车

101
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.083
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy
但是当医院开始提供化疗之后

102
00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:01.884
is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars.
他们发现病人通常都不想坐摆渡车

103
00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:05.810
They were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels.
化疗后的病人通常感觉非常恶心所以他们更想走回宾馆

104
00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:08.773
This desire path that you see diagonally, formed.
这就形成了这么一条对角线的心仪小路

105
00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:11.953
The patients even called it "The Chemo Trail."
病人们甚至给它起了名字——化疗之路

106
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.819
Now, when the hospital saw this originally,
当医院最开始注意到这条小路的时候

107
00:05:14.843 --> 00:05:17.737
they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it.
他们给这条路重新铺上草皮，并没有重视

108
00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:21.680
But after a while, they realized it was an important need
但是很快地，他们意识到这条小路的重要性

109
00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:23.481
they were meeting for their patients,
病人真的需要走这条路

110
00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:24.813
so they paved it.
于是他们把这条路铺了出来

111
00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:28.686
And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths.
我认为我们设计师的工作就是铺出这些逐渐出现的心仪小路

112
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.836
If we look back at the one in North London again,
如果我们回头再看看伦敦北部那条小路

113
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.230
that desire path hasn't always been there.
会发现那条心仪小路并不是最开始就存在的

114
00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:36.192
The reason it sprung up
它之所以会出现

115
00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:41.489
is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days,
是因为每到足球赛季的比赛日，球迷们都会涌到阿森纳俱乐部看球

116
00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:44.290
from the Underground station you see on the bottom right.
他们从地图右下角的地铁站出来

117
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:45.924
So you see the desire path.
这条心仪小路就这样形成了

118
00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:48.762
If we just wind the clock back a few years,
如果时光倒流几年

119
00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:50.983
when the stadium was being constructed,
当体育馆还没建好的时候

120
00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:52.566
there is no desire path.
这条路还不存在

121
00:05:53.617 --> 00:05:57.763
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging,
所以我们的工作就是观察等待这些路形成

122
00:05:58.387 --> 00:06:00.151
and, where appropriate, pave them,
再伺机把它们铺设成真正的道路

123
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.350
as someone did here.
就像下面这个例子一样

124
00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:04.659
Someone installed a barrier,
有人（在小路上）安装了一个路障

125
00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:09.116
people started walking across and round the bottom as you see,
然后发现人们要么跨过去，要么从底下钻过去

126
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.338
and they paved it.
后来他们就干脆把这条路铺上了

127
00:06:10.362 --> 00:06:11.942
(Laughter)
(笑声)

128
00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:14.354
But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well,
我觉得这是个很好的例子

129
00:06:14.378 --> 00:06:16.230
that, actually, the world is in flux.
它提示我们世界不是一成不变的

130
00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:17.310
It's constantly changing,
它始终都在不停变化

131
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.732
because if you look at the top of this image,
比如你看这张图片的上面部分

132
00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:21.748
there's another desire path forming.
另一条心仪小路正在形成

133
00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:25.763
So these three desire paths remind me
这三条心仪小路提醒着我

134
00:06:25.787 --> 00:06:28.934
we need to design for real human needs.
我们在设计时要考虑人们的真正需求

135
00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:31.882
I think empathy for what your customers want
我觉得对客户需求的同理心

136
00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:35.640
is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success.
可能是事业成功的最好先行指标

137
00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:37.809
Design for real needs
设计要满足客户真正的需求

138
00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:40.237
and design them in low friction,
并减少使用的难度

139
00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:43.610
because if you don't offer them in low friction,
因为一旦他们觉得这个设计难用

140
00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:46.229
someone else will, often the customer.
他们可能会自己做出反馈及调整

141
00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:50.855
Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want
第二，挖掘用户真正需求的最好方式

142
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.743
is to launch your service.
往往是进行前期实验

143
00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.547
The answer is rarely inside the building.
闭门造车很难得出答案

144
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:58.044
Get out there and see what people really want.
