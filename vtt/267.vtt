00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.538
I'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science,
我想给大家介绍一个新兴的科学领域，

2
00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.505
one that is still speculative but hugely exciting,
这个领域还处在理论阶段，但也很激动人心，

3
00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.158
and certainly one that's growing very rapidly.
当然目前发展也很迅猛。

4
00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:29.316
Quantum biology asks a very simple question:
量子生物学提出了一个非常简单的问题：

5
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.690
Does quantum mechanics --
量子力学——

6
00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:34.016
that weird and wonderful and powerful theory
这是个关于原子和分子的亚原子世界理论，

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.728
of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules
一个既神秘又奇妙还很强大的理论，

8
00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:40.240
that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry --
也是支撑着现代物理学和化学的理论——

9
00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:43.676
also play a role inside the living cell?
那它是否也在活体细胞里起着重要作用呢？

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.779
In other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena
换句话说：在生物体当中，

11
00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:51.791
in living organisms that can only be explained
是否有一些过程、生理反应、现象，

12
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.558
with a helping hand from quantum mechanics?
是只能借助量子力学来解释的呢？

13
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.003
Now, quantum biology isn't new;
其实量子生物学也不算新学科；

14
00:00:57.027 --> 00:00:59.428
it's been around since the early 1930s.
它的历史可追溯至20世纪30年代。

15
00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:03.463
But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments --
但是直到十年前左右，才有了周密的实验——

16
00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:06.951
in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy --
就是在生化实验室，利用光谱仪来做的实验——

17
00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:13.838
have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms
结果给出了非常明确有力的证据，说明确实有某些生理反应

18
00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:16.373
that require quantum mechanics to explain them.
需要通过量子力学来解释。

19
00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:20.823
Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists,
量子生物学集合了物理学家、生化学家

20
00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.488
molecular biologists -- it's a very interdisciplinary field.
和分子生物学家——是一个极其跨学科的领域。

21
00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:28.441
I come from quantum physics, so I'm a nuclear physicist.
我来自量子物理学领域，是个核物理学家。

22
00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:33.683
I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics.
我花了三十多年的时间 来试图理解量子力学。

23
00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:36.200
One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,
Niels Bohr，量子力学之父之一，

24
00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:39.574
said, If you're not astonished by it, then you haven't understood it.
说过，谁要是第一次听到量子理论时没有感到震惊，那他一定没听懂。

25
00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:42.900
So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it.
我还蛮庆幸自己现在还挺震惊的。

26
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:44.669
That's a good thing.
这是个好事。

27
00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:51.578
But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe --
这是个好但这也说明我研究的只是这个宇宙最小的结构，

28
00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.677
the building blocks of reality.
这个建立现实世界的一砖一瓦。

29
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.916
If we think about the scale of size,
要想知道这个结构的大小，

30
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.892
start with an everyday object like the tennis ball,
那么我们从网球这种日常物品开始吧，

31
00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:02.817
and just go down orders of magnitude in size --
然后将物体按大小将序排列——

32
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:08.038
from the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --
从针眼，到细胞，到细菌，再到酶——

33
00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:09.791
you eventually reach the nano-world.
最后才到纳米世界。

34
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.310
Now, nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of.
你们也许都听过纳米技术这个词。

35
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.514
A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.
一纳米就是十亿分之一米。

36
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.750
My area is the atomic nucleus, which is the tiny dot inside an atom.
我的研究领域是原子核，也就是原子当中的那小个点。

37
00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.706
It's even smaller in scale.
它体积比这更小。

38
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.648
This is the domain of quantum mechanics,
这就是量子力学的领域，

39
00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:28.513
and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it.
而物理学家和化学家花了很长的时间来努力适应这个领域。

40
00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:33.525
Biologists, on the other hand, have got off lightly, in my view.
而生物学家，在我看来，很轻松就避开了它。

41
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:38.222
They are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules.
他们很满足于这些分子球棍模型。

42
00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:39.328
(Laughter)
（笑声）

43
00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:42.550
The balls are the atoms, the sticks are the bonds between the atoms.
这球指的是原子，棍负责把原子连在一起。

44
00:02:42.574 --> 00:02:45.068
And when they can't build them physically in the lab,
如果在实验室里无法建立起实体的分子模型，

45
00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:47.484
nowadays, they have very powerful computers
现在，他们也可以用强大的电脑

46
00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:49.475
that will simulate a huge molecule.

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.163
This is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms.
这个蛋白质由100,000个原子组成。

48
00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:58.158
It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it.
这不怎么需要量子力学来解释。

49
00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.404
Quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s.
量子力学从上世纪20年代开始发展。

50
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:09.665
It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas
这是一套美丽而又强大的数学法则和理念，

51
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.297
that explain the world of the very small.
帮人们理解这个世界最小的结构。

52
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:15.693
And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world,
这是个和我们日常生活很不一样的世界，

53
00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:17.236
made up of trillions of atoms.
它由数万亿个原子组成。

54
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.817
It's a world built on probability and chance.
这是个建立在机率和概率之上的世界。

55
00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:22.940
It's a fuzzy world.
是个模糊的世界。

56
00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:24.694
It's a world of phantoms,
是个幽灵的世界，

57
00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:28.066
where particles can also behave like spread-out waves.
在这里，粒子们也可表现出散开的波状形态。

58
00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:32.839
If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then,
如果我们把量子力学或量子物理学想象成

59
00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:38.077
as the fundamental foundation of reality itself,
现实世界的最根本基础，那么，

60
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:39.831
then it's not surprising that we say
量子物理学支撑了有机化学，

61
00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.275
quantum physics underpins organic chemistry.
这种说法就不足为奇了。

62
00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.419
After all, it gives us the rules that tell us
毕竟，它有一套原则，

63
00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:47.084
how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules.
解释了原子如何组合在一起，从而建立起一个有机分子。

64
00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:50.347
Organic chemistry, scaled up in complexity,
有机化学，随着复杂度的增加，

65
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.693
gives us molecular biology, which of course leads to life itself.
又建立了分子生物学，而它又将我们带入生命科学。

66
00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:55.971
So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.
所以，从某个角度来说，这不足为奇。

67
00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:57.209
It's almost trivial.
这算是鸡毛蒜皮了。

68
00:03:57.233 --> 00:04:01.453
You say, "Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics."
你会说，“嗯，生命当然最终要靠量子力学来解释。”

69
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.351
But so does everything else.
但此外的一切也都是如此。

70
00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:07.990
So does all inanimate matter, made up of trillions of atoms.
所有无机物，也都是由数万亿个原子组成的。

71
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:13.199
Ultimately, there's a quantum level
最后，我们得在量子的层面上

72
00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:15.406
where we have to delve into this weirdness.
来探究这领域的神秘之处。

73
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.846
But in everyday life, we can forget about it.
但在日常生活中，我们会忘记它的神秘感。

74
00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:21.423
Because once you put together trillions of atoms,
因为，当数万亿个原子聚集在一起时，

75
00:04:21.447 --> 00:04:24.062
that quantum weirdness just dissolves away.
量子的神秘感就消失了。

76
00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:29.677
Quantum biology isn't about this.
量子生物学说的不是这个。

77
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.257
Quantum biology isn't this obvious.
量子生物学没这么浅显。

78
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:36.510
Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level.
当然，量子力学在分子水平上支撑着生命。

79
00:04:37.074 --> 00:04:43.078
Quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial --

80
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:47.578
the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics --
量子力学当中的反直觉观念——

81
00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:50.617
and to see if they do, indeed, play an important role
然后了解它们是否会在

82
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.093
in describing the processes of life.
描述生命进程中起到重要的作用。

83
00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:59.693
Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness
我有一个完美的例子来解释

84
00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:01.163
of the quantum world.
量子世界的反直觉观念。

85
00:05:01.187 --> 00:05:02.438
This is the quantum skier.
这是个量子滑雪者。

86
00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:05.102
He seems to be intact, he seems to be perfectly healthy,
他看起来很完整，看起来很健康，

87
00:05:05.126 --> 00:05:09.253
and yet, he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time.
但是，他也好像同时穿过了那棵树的两边。

88
00:05:09.277 --> 00:05:10.940
Well, if you saw tracks like that
嗯，当然，如果你看到这样的滑雪轨迹，

89
00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:13.273
you'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course.
你可能会觉得这是某种特技。

90
00:05:13.297 --> 00:05:15.888
But in the quantum world, this happens all the time.
但在量子世界里，这无时不刻都会发生。

91
00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:19.710
Particles can multitask, they can be in two places at once.
粒子是可以进行多任务处理的，它们可以同时出现在两个地方。

92
00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:22.062
They can do more than one thing at the same time.
它们在同一时间能执行多项任务。

93
00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:24.729
Particles can behave like spread-out waves.
它们好像散开的涟漪一样。

94
00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:26.717
It's almost like magic.
就好比魔术。

95
00:05:27.358 --> 00:05:30.107
Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century
物理学家和化学家用了近一个世纪

96
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.777
of trying to get used to this weirdness.
来适应这种神秘之物。

97
00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:34.615
I don't blame the biologists
我也不怪生物学家

98
00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.274
for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.
不用或不想学习量子力学。

99
00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:40.496
You see, this weirdness is very delicate;
你们看，这种神秘是很微妙的；

100
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.970
and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs.
我们物理学家在实验室里下了很大功夫来稳定它。

101
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:49.198
We cool our system down to near absolute zero,
我们把我们的系统冷却到接近绝对零度，

102
00:05:49.222 --> 00:05:51.167
we carry out our experiments in vacuums,
在真空中进行我们的实验，

103
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.718
we try and isolate it from any external disturbance.
我们努力将其从任何外界干扰中分离出来。

104
00:05:55.422 --> 00:06:00.500
That's very different from the warm, messy, noisy environment of a living cell.
那和活体细胞里温暖、凌乱又嘈杂的环境大相径庭。

105
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.567
Biology itself, if you think of molecular biology,
生物学，就分子生物学而言，

106
00:06:04.591 --> 00:06:10.558
seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry -- chemical reactions.
它似乎在化学——化学反应方面非常好地阐释了所有的生命进程。

107
00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:15.432
And these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions,
而这都是还原论、确定性的化学反应，

108
00:06:15.456 --> 00:06:20.570
showing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else,
它们显示，生命的成分说到底和其他事物一样，

109
00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:23.654
and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world,
而且我们要是可以在宏观世界里忘掉量子力学，

110
00:06:23.678 --> 00:06:26.924
then we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well.
那我们也可以在生物学中忘掉它。

111
00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:30.890
Well, one man begged to differ with this idea.
然而，有个人不同意这个观点。

112
00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:35.351
Erwin Schrödinger, of Schrödinger's Cat fame,
那就是埃尔温·薛定谔，他有个著名的薛定谔猫实验，

113
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.692
was an Austrian physicist.
是个奥地利物理学家。

114
00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:39.899
He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.
他是20世纪20年代量子力学创始人之一。

115
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.190
In 1944, he wrote a book called "What is Life?"
1944年，他写了本书叫做《生命是什么？》

116
00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.390
It was tremendously influential.
这本书影响巨大。

117
00:06:45.414 --> 00:06:48.295
It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson,
它影响了弗朗西斯·克里克和詹姆斯·沃森，

118
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.842
the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA.
就是发现DNA双螺旋结构的那两个人。

119
00:06:51.163 --> 00:06:54.831
To paraphrase a description in the book, he says:
在书中，他表达了这样的意思：

120
00:06:54.855 --> 00:07:00.641
At the molecular level, living organisms have a certain order,
在分子水平上，生命体有着某种秩序，

121
00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:03.897
a structure to them that's very different
一种结构，使其和其他随机的热力学原子冲撞

122
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:12.387
from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity.
以及一样复杂的无机质分子有着天壤之别。

123
00:07:13.324 --> 00:07:18.338
In fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure,
实际上，生命体似乎就是在一个结构中，以这种秩序运转着，

124
00:07:18.362 --> 00:07:22.196
just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero,
就好像被冷却到近绝对零度的无机质一样，

125
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.253
where quantum effects play a very important role.
量子理论在这里起到了很重要的作用。

126
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.260
There's something special about the structure -- the order --
活体细胞中的这个结构——这个秩序——

127
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.844
inside a living cell.
有着一些特别之处。

128
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:37.161
So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life.
所以，薛定谔推测，也许量子力学在生命学当中起到了某些作用。

129
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.341
It's a very speculative, far-reaching idea,
这是个极具推测性的且影响深远的观点，

130
00:07:41.365 --> 00:07:44.238
and it didn't really go very far.
但也没怎么发展下去了。

131
00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:46.889
But as I mentioned at the start,
但正如我一开始说的，

132
00:07:46.913 --> 00:07:49.712
in the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging,
在过去10年做了些实验，

133
00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:53.791
showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology
实验结果显示生物学中的某些现象

134
00:07:53.815 --> 00:07:55.578
do seem to require quantum mechanics.
确实需要量子力学来解释。

135
00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:58.725
I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones.
我想和大家分享几个最激动人心的实验。

136
00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:03.742
This is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world,
这是量子世界里最有名的现象之一，

137
00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:05.467
quantum tunneling.
叫做量子隧穿。

138
00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:09.880
The box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution
左边的框里有一个量子实体，它像波一样扩散开来——

139
00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:12.665
of a quantum entity -- a particle, like an electron,
这是个像电子一样的粒子，

140
00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:16.326
which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall.
它和从墙上反弹回来的小球不一样。

141
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.168
It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall,
它是一个波，可以穿过 一个实心墙，

142
00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.519
like a phantom leaping through to the other side.
像个幽灵似地从一边穿透到另一边。

143
00:08:24.543 --> 00:08:28.641
You can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box.
你在右手边的框里可以看到一些微弱的光斑。

144
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:34.205
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier,
量子隧穿表明，一个粒子能够撞上一堵无法穿透的墙，

145
00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:36.689
and yet somehow, as though by magic,
然而却又能像魔术一样，

146
00:08:36.713 --> 00:08:39.157
disappear from one side and reappear on the other.
从墙的一侧消失并出现在另一侧。

147
00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:43.729
The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall,
用最好的方法来解释的话，就是说如果你要把一个球扔到墙的另一侧，

148
00:08:43.753 --> 00:08:47.330
you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.
那你要给它足够能量让它越过墙顶。

149
00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:50.412
In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall,
但在量子世界里，你不需要将它从墙顶上扔过去，

150
00:08:50.436 --> 00:08:51.855
you can throw it at the wall, 
你只要往墙上扔就好了，

151
00:08:51.856 --> 00:08:57.190
and there's a certain non-zero probability that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.
然后这个球会在你这侧消失并出现在另一侧，而这个概率为非零。

152
00:08:57.214 --> 00:08:58.892
This isn't speculation, by the way.
这不是推测，顺便提下。

153
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:02.312
We're happy -- well, "happy" is not the right word --
我们很高兴——额，“高兴”这个词用得不对——

154
00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:04.381
(Laughter)
（笑声）

155
00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:06.023
we are familiar with this.
我们是熟悉这个的。

156
00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:08.792
(Laughter)
（笑声）

157
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.110
Quantum tunneling takes place all the time;
量子隧穿随时随刻都在发生；

158
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.801
in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.
实际上，这也是太阳发光的原因。

159
00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:15.984
The particles fuse together,
粒子融合在一起，

160
00:09:16.008 --> 00:09:19.706
and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling.
然后太阳通过量子隧穿将氢转化为氦。

161
00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:27.720
Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells.
七八十年代的时候，人们发现活细胞中也有量子隧穿。

162
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:34.376
Enzymes, those workhorses of life, the catalysts of chemical reactions --
酶，为维持生命努力运作着，是化学反应的催化剂——

163
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.566
enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells,
酶这种生物分子加快了活细胞中的化学反应，

164
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.293
by many, many orders of magnitude.
规模大小不一。

165
00:09:40.317 --> 00:09:43.101
And it's always been a mystery how they do this.
但它们是如何做到这点的，至今任是一个谜。

166
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.659
Well, it was discovered
嗯，人们发现

167
00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:49.535
that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of,
酶发展出了一种方法，

168
00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:54.787
is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons,
就是通过传送亚原子粒子，例如电子和当然还有质子这种，

169
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:59.472
from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling.
酶通过量子隧穿将它们从分子的一部分传输到另一部分。

170
00:10:00.153 --> 00:10:03.004
It's efficient, it's fast, it can disappear --
这效率非常高，很快，它——

171
00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:06.139
a proton can disappear from one place, and reappear on the other.
一个质子能从一个地方消失，然后在另一个地方再出现。

172
00:10:06.163 --> 00:10:07.792
Enzymes help this take place.
而酶使之成为可能。

173
00:10:08.368 --> 00:10:11.051
This is research that's been carried out back in the 80s,
这个研究是在80年代进行的，

174
00:10:11.075 --> 00:10:15.112
particularly by a group in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.
其中Judith Klinman带领的一个伯克利的团队作用尤其突出。

175
00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:18.776
Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this.
另一些英国的团队现在也已肯定酶有这种能力。

176
00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:23.417
Research carried out by my group --
我的团队做的研究——

177
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:25.875
so as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist,
我之前说过，我是个核物理学家，

178
00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:28.954
but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics
但我也意识到，我已在原子核领域应用了量子力学，

179
00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:34.063
in atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well.
那么我也可以把它也应用到其他领域。

180
00:10:35.224 --> 00:10:37.034
One question we asked
我们提出的一个问题是

181
00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:41.356
is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA.
量子隧穿在DNA变异中是否也发挥着作用。

182
00:10:41.663 --> 00:10:45.323
Again, this is not a new idea; it goes all the way back to the early 60s.
这仍然不是个新概念；它任然要追溯到60年代早期。

183
00:10:45.347 --> 00:10:48.308
The two strands of DNA, the double-helix structure,
DNA分子链，即双螺旋结构，

184
00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:51.155
are held together by rungs; it's like a twisted ladder.
是由像阶梯一样的东西连接在一起的；像是个扭曲的梯子一样。

185
00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:54.686
And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds --
而这些梯子上的阶梯就是氢键——

186
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.500
protons, that act as the glue between the two strands.
质子，其作用是将两束分子链黏合在一起。

187
00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:03.274
So if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules --
那么放大来看，你就会发现它们将这些大分子——

188
00:11:03.298 --> 00:11:04.905
nucleotides -- together.
核苷酸——聚合在一起。

189
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.100
Zoom in a bit more.
再放大一点看：

190
00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:09.040
So, this a computer simulation.
这是个电脑模拟。

191
00:11:09.675 --> 00:11:13.217
The two white balls in the middle are protons,
中间的两个白色的球是质子，

192
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:15.540
and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond.
你们看得到这是双氢键。

193
00:11:15.564 --> 00:11:18.878
One prefers to sit on one side; the other, on the other side
其中一个喜欢待在这端；另一个，则待在双链的另一端，

194
00:11:18.902 --> 00:11:23.460
of the two strands of the vertical lines going down, which you can't see.
这是纵向走向的，你们看不到。

195
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.625
It can happen that these two protons can hop over.
这两个质子也有可能跳到另一端。

196
00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:29.085
Watch the two white balls.
看着两个白球。

197
00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:31.566
They can jump over to the other side.
它们可以跳到另外一端。

198
00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:37.705
If the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication,
如果DNA双链分开了，引发复制过程，

199
00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:40.928
and the two protons are in the wrong positions,
而恰好这两个质子的位置错了，

200
00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:42.715
this can lead to a mutation.
那么就会导致变异。

201
00:11:43.024 --> 00:11:44.896
This has been known for half a century.
这个现象已为人所知半个世纪了。

202
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.263
The question is: How likely are they to do that,
但问题来了：它们发生错误的概率是多大，

203
00:11:47.287 --> 00:11:49.665
and if they do, how do they do it?
如果它们出错了，又是怎么出错的呢？

204
00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:52.708
Do they jump across, like the ball going over the wall?
它们就这样跳到另一端，就好像那个球越过那堵墙那样吗？

205
00:11:52.732 --> 00:11:56.234
Or can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy?
还是它们在没有足够能量的情况下，也能实现量子隧穿那样的穿越呢？

206
00:11:56.909 --> 00:12:01.161
Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here.
早期研究提出量子隧穿可能在这发挥了作用。

207
00:12:01.185 --> 00:12:03.309
We still don't know yet how important it is;
我们还不知道其重要性有多大；

208
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:05.125
this is still an open question.
目前还没有确切答案。

209
00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:07.169
It's speculative,
现在只有推测，

210
00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:09.836
but it's one of those questions that is so important
但如果说量子力学会影响变异的话，

211
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.306
that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations,
这就是个非常重要的问题之一了，

212
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.629
surely this must have big implications,
对于理解某些类型的变异，

213
00:12:14.653 --> 00:12:17.347
to understand certain types of mutations,
甚至是可能导致细胞癌变的变异，

214
00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:21.127
possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous.
这当然这有着非常重大的意义。

215
00:12:22.623 --> 00:12:27.922
Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence,
生物学中另一个量子力学的例子是，

216
00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:30.299
in one of the most important processes in biology,
生物学中最重要的一个过程之一，

217
00:12:30.323 --> 00:12:34.264
photosynthesis: plants and bacteria taking sunlight,
光合作用里的量子相干性：植物和细菌吸收了光照，

218
00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:37.242
and using that energy to create biomass.
并利用其中的能量来制造生物质。

219
00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:42.187
Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking.
量子相关性指的是量子实体同时执行多任务的现象。

220
00:12:42.732 --> 00:12:44.336
It's the quantum skier.
这是个量子滑雪者。

221
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.312
It's an object that behaves like a wave,
这个物体表现得像波一样，

222
00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:50.238
so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other,
所以它的移动不是单一方向的，

223
00:12:50.262 --> 00:12:53.582
but can follow multiple pathways at the same time.
而是同时能够走不同的路线。

224
00:12:54.528 --> 00:12:58.444
Some years ago, the world of science was shocked
几年前，一篇论文的发布震惊了科学界，

225
00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:05.852
when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria,
它提出实验证明量子相干性存在于细菌中，

226
00:13:05.876 --> 00:13:07.562
carrying out photosynthesis.
执行着光合作用。

227
00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:10.650
The idea is that the photon, the particle of light, the sunlight,
这个观点说的是，光子，即光粒子，阳光，

228
00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:14.018
the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule,
光量子被叶绿素捕捉到后，

229
00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:16.633
is then delivered to what's called the reaction center,
被传递到叫做反应中心的地方，

230
00:13:16.657 --> 00:13:18.721
where it can be turned into chemical energy.
在这里它被转化成化学能量。

231
00:13:18.745 --> 00:13:21.393
And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route;
而到达反应中心的路线不止一个；

232
00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:23.632
it follows multiple pathways at once,
光量子会同时走多个路线，

233
00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:27.993
to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center
最后找出最高效的路线达到反应中心，

234
00:13:28.017 --> 00:13:29.738
without dissipating as waste heat.
从而不会消耗成余热。

235
00:13:31.048 --> 00:13:34.357
Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell.
量子相干性效应也存在于活细胞里。

236
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:36.501
A remarkable idea,
这是个卓越的观点，

237
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:42.760
and yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out,
而目前每周也都有新证据、新论文发表来证明这个观点，

238
00:13:42.784 --> 00:13:44.996
confirming that this does indeed take place.
证明这个现象的确存在。

239
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:50.114
My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.
我的第三个也是最后一个例子，是个非常美丽奇妙的观点。

240
00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:54.201
It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you.
同样也极具推测性，但我要和你们分享一下。

241
00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:58.837
The European robin migrates from Scandinavia
欧洲斯堪的纳维亚的知更鸟

242
00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:01.496
down to the Mediterranean, every autumn,
每个秋天都会迁徙到地中海，

243
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.893
and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects,
就和许多其它海洋动物甚至是昆虫一样，

244
00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:09.217
they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field.
它们都靠感应地球磁场来感知方向。

245
00:14:10.788 --> 00:14:13.215
Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak;
地球磁场非常的弱；

246
00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.319
it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet,
它比我们的冰箱贴还弱100倍，

247
00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:20.944
and yet it affects the chemistry -- somehow -- within a living organism.
然而它却影响着生物体中的化学反应。

248
00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:25.558
That's not in doubt -- a German couple of ornithologists,
毋庸置疑——德国的鸟类学家夫妇

249
00:14:25.582 --> 00:14:29.842
Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,
Wolfgang和Roswitha Wiltschko在20世纪70年代确认，

250
00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:33.843
the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field,
知更鸟的确通过感应地球磁场来探路，

251
00:14:33.867 --> 00:14:37.194
to give it directional information -- a built-in compass.
从中获取方向信息——这是一种内置的指南针。

252
00:14:37.218 --> 00:14:39.467
The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it?
令人不解的谜团是：它们是怎么做到的？

253
00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.201
Well, the only theory in town --
嗯，我们现在只有一个理论--

254
00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:46.661
we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town --
我们不确定这个理论是否正确，但目前只有这么一个理论--

255
00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.669
is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement.
就是，它们是通过一个叫做量子纠缠的效应来实现导航的。

256
00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:52.761
Inside the robin's retina --
在知更鸟的视网膜里--

257
00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:57.017
I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome,
我可不是开玩笑啊--在知更鸟的视网膜上有一个蛋白质

258
00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:58.421
which is light-sensitive.
叫做隐花色素，它对光很敏感。

259
00:14:58.445 --> 00:15:02.384
Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons are quantum-entangled.
在印花色素里，有一对相互纠缠的电子。

260
00:15:02.408 --> 00:15:05.640
Now, quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart,
量子纠缠意味着两个粒子相距甚远，

261
00:15:05.664 --> 00:15:08.498
and yet somehow remain in contact with each other.
却又能彼此保持联系。

262
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:10.257
Even Einstein hated this idea;
连爱因斯坦都讨厌这个观点；

263
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.320
he called it "spooky action at a distance."
他把它叫做“鬼魅般的超距作用。”

264
00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.225
(Laughter)
（笑声）

265
00:15:14.249 --> 00:15:17.692
So if Einstein doesn't like it, then we can all be uncomfortable with it.
那么如果爱因斯坦不喜欢这个观点，那么我们就有理由也不喜欢。

266
00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:20.569
Two quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule
单细胞当中的两个有着量子纠缠关系的电子

267
00:15:20.593 --> 00:15:22.064
dance a delicate dance
跳着非常微妙的舞蹈，

268
00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:26.184
that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field.
并对鸟类在地球磁场里飞翔的方向很敏感。

269
00:15:26.668 --> 00:15:29.278
We don't know if it's the correct explanation,
我不知道这么说对不对，

270
00:15:29.302 --> 00:15:33.846
but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?
但是哇哦，如果量子力学能帮助鸟类感知方向，这不是很激动人心的事吗？

271
00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:37.610
Quantum biology is still in it infancy.
量子生物学还处在婴儿时期。

272
00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:41.118
It's still speculative.
还处在推测阶段。

273
00:15:41.562 --> 00:15:45.411
But I believe it's built on solid science.
不过我相信它是建立在严谨科学之上的。

274
00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:49.546
I also think that in the coming decade or so,
我也认为在接下来十年左右，

275
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:54.411
we're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life --
我们会看到，其实它在生活中无处不在——

276
00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:59.031
that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world.
生活已经演变出了许多利用量子世界的技能。

277
00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:01.274
Watch this space.
请关注这个领域。

278
00:16:01.298 --> 00:16:02.455
Thank you.
谢谢。
