00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.376
I've got a confession.
坦白地说，

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.958
I love looking through people's garbage.
我喜欢翻看别人丢弃的垃圾。

3
00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:19.537
Now, it's not some creepy thing.
这可不是什么怪癖。

4
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.727
I'm usually just looking for old electronics,
我通常只是寻找旧的电子器件，

5
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.177
stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
那些我可以带回工作室进行改装的东西。

6
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:27.840
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
我尤其痴迷于光盘驱动器。

7
00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:30.473
Each one's got three different motors,
每一个驱动器都有三个不同的马达，

8
00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.434
so now you can build things that move.
这样你就能组装一些可以动的东西了。

9
00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:35.173
There's switches so you can turn things on and off.
驱动器还有开关，让你能够实现启动和关闭功能。

10
00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:37.055
There's even a freaking laser,
它甚至还有一个非同寻常的激光器，

11
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.855
so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.
让你能把一个看起来还不错的机器人变得炫酷无比。

12
00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:45.764
Now, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage,
我已经用废弃材料造出了许多东西，

13
00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:48.569
and some of these things have even been kind of useful.
而且其中一些还是很有用的。

14
00:00:48.593 --> 00:00:49.778
But here's the thing,
不过事实上，

15
00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:52.403
for me, garbage is just a chance to play,
对我来说，废品只是提供了一个玩转的机会，

16
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.350
to be creative and build things to amuse myself.
让我富有创造力，打造自娱自乐的东西。

17
00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:59.010
This is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.
这是我的兴趣所在，所以我把它融入了我的一部分日常工作。

18
00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:01.591
I lead a university-based biological research lab,
我带领着一个大学的生物研究实验室，

19
00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:05.552
where we value curiosity and exploration above all else.
我们把好奇心和探究精神摆在首位。

20
00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:08.172
We aren't focused on any particular problem,
我们不专注于任何特定的问题，

21
00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:10.758
and we're not trying to solve any particular disease.
也没有尝试去解决任何特定的疾病。

22
00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:13.466
This is just a place where people can come
这只是一个人们可以来

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.266
and ask fascinating questions and find answers.
提出奇妙的问题并找到答案的地方。

24
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.155
And I realized a long time ago
很久以前我就意识到，

25
00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.421
that if I challenge people to build the equipment they need
如果我挑战别人用我找到的废品

26
00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:24.558
out of the garbage I find,
造出他们需要的设备，

27
00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:27.345
it's a great way to foster creativity.
这是一种很好的培养创造力的方式。

28
00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.520
And what happened
后来，

29
00:01:28.544 --> 00:01:33.465
was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab.
全世界的艺术家和科学家们开始纷纷来到我的实验室。

30
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.698
And it's not just because we value unconventional ideas,
并不只是因为我们重视新奇的想法，

31
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:40.491
it's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor.
更是因为我们用科学的精确性检测并证实那些想法。

32
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.341
So one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart,
有一天我正在拆解东西，

33
00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:47.222
and I had this sudden idea:
我突然产生了这样的想法：

34
00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:50.685
Could I treat biology like hardware?
我能不能把生物体当作硬件？

35
00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.960
Could I dismantle a biological system,
我能不能拆分一个生物系统，

36
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:54.407
mix and match the parts
混合并配对拆分出来的部分，

37
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:57.385
and then put it back together in some new and creative way?
然后用全新的创造性的方式把它重新拼装？

38
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.850
My lab started working on this,
于是我的实验室开始了相关的研究，

39
00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:01.767
and I want to show you the result.
我想给你们展示一下成果。

40
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.111
Can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?
你们有谁能够告诉我这是什么水果吗？

41
00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:08.070
Audience: Apple!
观众：苹果！

42
00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:10.430
Andrew Pelling: That's right -- it's an apple.
安德鲁·佩林：没错——这是个苹果。

43
00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:12.751
Now, I actually want you to notice as well
我现在也需要你们注意，

44
00:02:12.477 --> 00:02:15.281
that this is a lot redder than most apples.
它比其他苹果要红得多。

45
00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:18.840
And that's because we grew human cells into it.
原因是我们在其中植入了人类细胞。

46
00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:23.042
We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple,
我们拿了一个纯正的麦金塔苹果（译者注：苹果公司早期一款个人电脑），

47
00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:26.085
removed all the apple cells and DNA
移除所有的苹果细胞和DNA，

48
00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:28.415
and then implanted human cells.
再植入人类细胞。

49
00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:31.201
And what we're left with after removing all the apple cells
移除全部苹果细胞后，

50
00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:32.966
is this cellulose scaffold.
剩下的是纤维素骨架。

51
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.127
This is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.
正是纤维素保证了植物的形状和质感。

52
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.123
And these little holes that you can see,
还有你们看到的这些小孔，

53
00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:40.548
this is where all the apple cells used to be.
就是苹果细胞原来所在的地方。

54
00:02:41.074 --> 00:02:42.258
So then we come along,
然后我们继续试验，

55
00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:45.344
we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.
植入了一些哺乳动物细胞，你们可以看到是蓝色的。

56
00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:47.576
What happens is, these guys start multiplying
接下来，它们开始繁殖，

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.594
and they fill up this entire scaffold.
并充满了整个骨架空隙。

58
00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:52.042
As weird as this is,
听起来有些不可思议，

59
00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:56.751
it's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.
这的确能使我们联想到人体的组织排列方式。

60
00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:59.028
And we found in our pre-clinical work
我们在临床前试验时发现，

61
00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:01.448
that you can implant these scaffolds into the body,
你可以把这些纤维素骨架植入体内，

62
00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:06.394
and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive.
而身体会提供细胞和血液供应来维持其生命活动。

63
00:03:07.168 --> 00:03:10.265
This is the point when people started asking me,
就在这个时候人们开始问我，

64
00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:14.617
"Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?"
“安德鲁，你能从苹果中制造出人体部位吗？”

65
00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:17.845
And I'm like, "You've come to the right place."
我答道：“你来对地方了。”

66
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.146
(Laughter)
（笑声）

67
00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:21.720
I actually brought this up with my wife.
我也跟我的老婆提起过这件事，

68
00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.478
She's a musical instrument maker,
她是一位乐器制造家，

69
00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:25.815
and she does a lot of wood carving for a living.
也把制作木雕当成一种职业。

70
00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.080
So I asked her,
所以我问她，

71
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:33.282
"Could you, like, literally carve some ears out of an apple for us?"
“你可以为我们用苹果雕刻出一些耳朵吗？”

72
00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:34.953
And she did.
她真的做到了。

73
00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:37.749
So I took her ears to the lab.
后来我带着她雕刻的耳朵去了实验室。

74
00:03:37.773 --> 00:03:39.526
We then started preparing them.
我们开始筹备实验。

75
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.136
Yeah, I know.
是的，我知道（这看起来很惊悚）。

76
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.193
(Laughter)
（笑声）

77
00:03:45.217 --> 00:03:46.935
It's a good lab, man.
伙计们，这可是个很棒的实验室。

78
00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.420
(Laughter)
（笑声）

79
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.614
And then we grew cells on them.
之后我们在上面培植细胞。

80
00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.213
And this is the result.
结果是这样的。

81
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:58.186
Listen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.
听我说，我的实验室并不参与制造耳朵的生意。

82
00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:02.934
People have actually been working on this for decades.
人们已经研究这一项目几十年了。

83
00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.606
Here's the issue:
问题在于：

84
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.036
commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic,
商业化的骨架组织价格极高，而且问题重重。

85
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.685
because they're sourced from proprietary products,
因为它们来源于专利产品，

86
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:13.788
animals or cadavers.
动物或尸体。

87
00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:21.958
We used an apple and it cost pennies.
我们只用了一个几分钱的苹果。

88
00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:24.730
What's also really cool here
更炫酷的是，

89
00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:26.899
is it's not that hard to make these things.
制造这些东西并不是很难。

90
00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:29.855
The equipment you need can be built from garbage,
你所需要的设备可以由废品打造，

91
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.062
and the key processing step only requires soap and water.
而且关键的加工步骤只需要肥皂和水。

92
00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:38.528
So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
于是，我们把制作教程公开上传到网上。

93
00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.349
And then we founded a mission-driven company,
然后我们成立了一家身负使命的公司，

94
00:04:41.373 --> 00:04:43.751
and we're developing kits to make it easier
旨在开发成套的工具，

95
00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:47.928
for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home.
让任何有水槽和焊铁的人能够很方便的在家完成这些。

96
00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:52.025
What I'm really curious about is if one day,
我真正好奇的是会不会有一天，

97
00:04:52.049 --> 00:04:57.300
it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies
人们有可能修复、改造、强化我们自己的身体，

98
00:04:57.324 --> 00:04:59.320
with stuff we make in the kitchen.
用到的只是我们厨房里的材料。

99
00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:02.241
Speaking of kitchens,
好，说到厨房，

100
00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:05.198
here's some asparagus.
这是一些芦笋。

101
00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:07.932
They're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.
它们很可口，不过会让你的尿液有股怪味。

102
00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:09.182
(Laughter)
（笑声）

103
00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:11.829
Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing
有一次，我在我的厨房里发现，

104
00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.439
that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus,
当你观察芦笋茎秆那一端（的截面），

105
00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:17.454
what you can see are all these tiny little vessels.
你会看到这些细小的导管。

106
00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:19.127
And when we image them in the lab,
而当我们在实验室里观察它们时，

107
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:22.140
you can see how the cellulose forms these structures.
你会发现纤维素是如何形成这些结构的。

108
00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:24.925
This image reminds me of two things:
这张图让我想到了两样东西。

109
00:05:25.521 --> 00:05:27.403
our blood vessels
我们的血管，

110
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:31.175
and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.
和我们的神经和脊髓的结构组织。

111
00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:32.971
So here's the question:
那么问题来了：

112
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.860
Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels?
我们能否沿着这些通道培植神经轴突或神经元呢?

113
00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:39.510
Because if we can,
如果我们可以实现，

114
00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:43.801
then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections
也许我们就能用芦笋来形成全新的节点，

115
00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:46.682
between the ends of damaged and severed nerves.
连接损伤或切断的神经末梢。

116
00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.250
Or maybe even a spinal cord.
或者甚至可以是脊髓。

117
00:05:49.946 --> 00:05:51.232
Don't get me wrong --
不要误会——

118
00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:53.260
this is exceptionally challenging
这非常具有挑战性，

119
00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:54.879
and really hard work to do,
而且极其难操作，

120
00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:57.521
and we are not the only ones working on this.
并不是只有我们正在研究这方面内容。

121
00:05:57.936 --> 00:06:00.876
But we are the only ones using asparagus.
但只有我们在使用芦笋。

122
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.407
(Laughter)
（笑声）

123
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.998
Right now, we've got really promising pilot data.
如今，我们已经取得了具备可行性的实验数据，

124
00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:09.499
And we're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons
正在和人体组织工程师和神经外科医生合作，

125
00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.015
to find out what's actually possible.
来找出其中的可能性。

126
00:06:12.613 --> 00:06:15.167
So listen, all of the work I've shown you,
听我说，我向你们展示的所有工作，

127
00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:18.291
the stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage
我身边所有这些自己造出来的东西，

128
00:06:18.408 --> 00:06:21.078
and the other projects my lab is involved in
还有我的实验室参与的其他项目，

129
00:06:20.638 --> 00:06:24.398
are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.
都是我玩转你们丢的垃圾的直接结果。

130
00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:31.250
Play -- play is a key part of my scientific practice.
玩转——玩转是我科学实践的关键。

131
00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:35.258
It's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative
它能训练我的大脑突破常规，富有创意，

132
00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:38.287
and to decide to make human apple ears.
让我决定制作人类的苹果耳朵。

133
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:42.962
So, the next time any of you are looking at some old,
所以，下一次当你们看到一些老旧的，

134
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:47.565
broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology,
破损的，不好用的，废铜烂铁一样的科技产品，

135
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.186
I want you to think of me.
我希望你们能想起我。

136
00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:51.177
Because I want it.
因为我需要它们。

137
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.352
(Laughter)
（笑声）

138
00:06:52.376 --> 00:06:56.383
Seriously, please find any way to get in touch with me,
说真的，请想尽一切方法联系我，

139
00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:58.348
and let's see what we can build.
