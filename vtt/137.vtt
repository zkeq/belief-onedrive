69
00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:31.645
you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer

70
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.835
and you have to guess.
[AI] 你得猜。

71
00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.050
So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online.

00:03:42.427 --> 00:03:45.446
30 percent of the time that it was a human.

77
00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:50.883
We have poems on the bot or not database

109
00:05:29.657 --> 00:05:34.126
it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language.
[AI] 它分析源文本以了解它是如何使用语言的。

110
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.650
and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text.

But the important thing to know about RKCP
[AI] 但是关于RKCP最重要的是要知道

118
00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:01.592
is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.

119
00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.455
The language is just raw material.

124
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:19.248
that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem.

and Gertrude Stein is a human.
[AI] 格特鲁德·斯坦是一个人。

126
00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:26.738
So what we've done here is. more or less. a reverse Turing test.
[AI] 所以我们在这里所做的就是。或多或少反向图灵测试。

127
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.939
So Gertrude Stein. who's a human. is able to write a poem
[AI] 所以格特鲁德·斯坦。谁是人类。他会写一首诗

133
00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:55.482
So far we've had humans that write like humans.
[AI] 到目前为止，我们已经有了像人类一样写作的人类。

134
00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:58.617
we have computers that write like computers.
[AI] 我们有像计算机一样书写的计算机。

135
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.696
we have computers that write like humans.
[AI] 我们有像人类一样书写的计算机。

136
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.751
but we also have. perhaps most confusingly. humans that write like computers.
[AI] 但我们也有。也许最令人困惑的是。像计算机一样写字的人。

137
00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:10.524
So what do we take from all of this?
[AI] 那么我们从这一切中得到了什么呢？

138
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.588
Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human
[AI] 我们是否认为威廉·布莱克更像人类

139
00:07:14.612 --> 00:07:15.861
than Gertrude Stein?
[AI] 而不是格特鲁德·斯坦？

140
00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:18.931
Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?
[AI] 还是说格特鲁德·斯坦比威廉·布莱克更像一台电脑？

141
00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:20.507
(Laughter)
[AI] （众笑）

142
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:22.854
These are questions I've been asking myself
[AI] 这些是我一直在问自己的问题

143
00:07:22.878 --> 00:07:24.343
for around two years now.
[AI] 大约两年了。

144
00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:26.676
and I don't have any answers.
[AI] 我没有任何答案。

145
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.030
But what I do have are a bunch of insights
[AI] 但我确实有很多见解

146
00:07:29.054 --> 00:07:31.588
about our relationship with technology.
[AI] 关于我们与技术的关系。

147
00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:36.428
So my first insight is that. for some reason.
[AI] 所以我的第一个见解是。出于某种原因。

148
00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:39.563
we associate poetry with being human.
[AI] 我们把诗歌与人联系在一起。

149
00:07:40.017 --> 00:07:43.732
So that when we ask. "Can a computer write poetry?"
[AI] 所以当我们问的时候。“电脑能写诗吗？”

150
00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:44.949
we're also asking.
[AI] 我们也在问。

151
00:07:44.973 --> 00:07:46.771
"What does it mean to be human
[AI] “这对人类意味着什么

152
00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:49.967
and how do we put boundaries around this category?
[AI] 我们如何界定这一类别？

153
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:53.649
How do we say who or what can be part of this category?"
[AI] 我们如何说谁或什么可以属于这一类别？"

154
00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:57.547
This is an essentially philosophical question. I believe.
[AI] 这本质上是一个哲学问题。我相信。

155
00:07:57.571 --> 00:08:01.151
and it can't be answered with a yes or no test. like the Turing test.
[AI] 而且不能用“是”或“否”来回答。比如图灵测试。

156
00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:04.670
I also believe that Alan Turing understood this.
[AI] 我也相信艾伦·图灵明白这一点。

157
00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:07.999
and that when he devised his test back in 1950.
[AI] 当他在1950年设计他的测试时。

158
00:08:08.023 --> 00:08:10.825
he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.
[AI] 他这样做是出于哲学上的挑衅。

159
00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:18.485
So my second insight is that. when we take the Turing test for poetry.
[AI] 所以我的第二个见解是。当我们参加图灵诗歌测试时。

160
00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.969
we're not really testing the capacity of the computers
[AI] 我们并不是在真正测试计算机的容量

161
00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:24.886
because poetry-generating algorithms.
[AI] 因为诗歌生成算法。

162
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.473
they're pretty simple and have existed. more or less. since the 1950s.
[AI] 它们非常简单，并且已经存在。或多或少从20世纪50年代开始。

163
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.993
What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry. rather.
[AI] 我们正在做的是图灵诗歌测试。相当地

164
00:08:34.017 --> 00:08:38.632
is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness.
[AI] 正在收集关于什么是人性的观点。

165
00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:42.862
So. what I've figured out.
[AI] 所以我发现了什么。

166
00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:45.858
we've seen this when earlier today.
[AI] 今天早些时候我们已经看到了这一点。

167
00:08:45.882 --> 00:08:48.360
we say that William Blake is more of a human
[AI] 我们说威廉·布莱克更像一个人

168
00:08:48.384 --> 00:08:49.949
than Gertrude Stein.
[AI] 而不是格特鲁德·斯坦。

169
00:08:49.973 --> 00:08:52.435
Of course. this doesn't mean that William Blake
[AI] 当然这并不意味着威廉·布莱克

170
00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:54.287
was actually more human
[AI] 实际上更人性化

171
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:56.638
or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.
[AI] 或者说格特鲁德·斯坦更像一台电脑。

172
00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:02.067
It simply means that the category of the human is unstable.
[AI] 这仅仅意味着人类的范畴是不稳定的。

173
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.344
This has led me to understand
[AI] 这让我明白了

174
00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:08.131
that the human is not a cold. hard fact.
[AI] 人不是感冒。确凿的事实。

175
00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:11.784
Rather. it is something that's constructed with our opinions

176
00:09:11.808 --> 00:09:14.663
and something that changes over time.
[AI] 随着时间的推移会发生变化。

177
00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:20.970
So my final insight is that the computer. more or less.
[AI] 所以我最后的见解是计算机。或多或少

178
00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:25.000
works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human
[AI] 它就像一面镜子，可以反映人类的任何想法

179
00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:26.399
that we show it.
[AI] 我们展示它。

180
00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:28.662
We show it Emily Dickinson.
[AI] 我们给它看艾米丽·迪金森。

181
00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:31.007
it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
[AI] 它把艾米丽·迪金森还给了我们。

182
00:09:31.588 --> 00:09:33.422
We show it William Blake.
[AI] 我们给它看威廉·布莱克。

183
00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:35.731
that's what it reflects back to us.
[AI] 这就是它对我们的反映。

184
00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:37.594
We show it Gertrude Stein.
[AI] 我们给它看格特鲁德·斯坦。

185
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:40.088
what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
[AI] 我们得到的是格特鲁德·斯坦。

186
00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:43.271
More than any other bit of technology.
[AI] 比任何其他技术都重要。

187
00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:48.460
the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
[AI] 计算机是一面镜子，反映了我们教它的人的任何想法。

188
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.168
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing
[AI] 所以我相信你们很多人都听说了

189
00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:55.054
a lot about artificial intelligence recently.
[AI] 最近有很多关于人工智能的事情。

190
00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:59.344
And much of the conversation is.
[AI] 大部分对话都是这样的。

191
00:10:00.112 --> 00:10:01.301
can we build it?
[AI] 我们能建造它吗？

192
00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:05.338
Can we build an intelligent computer?

193
00:10:05.362 --> 00:10:08.125
Can we build a creative computer?

194
00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.262
What we seem to be asking over and over
[AI] 我们一遍又一遍地问

195
00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:13.010
is can we build a human-like computer?
[AI] 我们能造一台像人类一样的计算机吗？

196
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:15.337
But what we've seen just now
[AI] 但是我们刚才看到的

197
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:18.449
is that the human is not a scientific fact.
[AI] 人类不是一个科学事实。

198
00:10:18.473 --> 00:10:22.003
that it's an ever-shifting. concatenating idea
[AI] 这是一个不断变化的过程。连接思想

199
00:10:22.027 --> 00:10:24.558
and one that changes over time.
[AI] 而且随着时间的推移会发生变化。

200
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.734
So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas
[AI] 所以当我们开始与这些想法搏斗时

201
00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:30.144
of artificial intelligence in the future.

202
00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:32.073
we shouldn't only be asking ourselves.
[AI] 我们不应该只问自己。

203
00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:33.465
"Can we build it?"
[AI] “我们能建造它吗？”

204
00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:35.383
But we should also be asking ourselves.
[AI] 但我们也应该问问自己。

205
00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:39.120
"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?"
[AI] “我们想把什么样的人类观念反映给我们？”

206
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.333
This is an essentially philosophical idea.
[AI] 这本质上是一种哲学思想。

207
00:10:42.357 --> 00:10:45.354
and it's one that can't be answered with software alone.
[AI] 这是单靠软件无法解决的问题。

208
00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:50.355
but I think requires a moment of species-wide. existential reflection.

209
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.013
Thank you.
