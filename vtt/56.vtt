﻿1
00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.707
I often have this strange thought
我经常有个奇异的想法：

2
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:17.290
that aliens come down to Earth to check us out.
如果外星人来地球拜访我们，

3
00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:19.999
They beam up a hundred scientists and they ask them,
把一百位科学家吸入飞船问道：

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.832
"What's going on on your planet?"
“你的星球怎么了？”

5
00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.790
And the aliens quickly learn something:
它们很快会发现

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.832
that all of these scientists have concluded
所有科学家的结论都是

7
00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:29.749
that pollution from our industrial activity is irreversibly heating the earth
工业活动的污染 正在不可逆转得加热地球，

8
00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.956
in a way that will make it very hard for us to live here safely.
将使人类难以安全生存。

9
00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:32.957
Then they do the same thing,
当外星人同样地

10
00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:34.331
Then they do the same thing,
把一百位普通市民吸入飞船，

11
00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:36.540
but this time they beam up another 100 people,
而他们不是科学家， 是与你我一样的普通市民，

12
00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:39.415
and they're not scientists, they're regular people like us.
它们用五根手指就能记录

13
00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.873
They could count on one hand
提起气候变化的人数。

14
00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.707
how many of those people would even mention climate change.
也许会有二，三十人 甚至不曾听过这个词。

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.747
Two or three dozen of them may never have even heard the term.
其中的美国人,

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.622
And among the Americans in the group,
每四人中只有一人 会担忧此事。

17
00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:51.957
only one in four would be highly concerned about the issue.
我认为外星人会感到非常震惊。

18
00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:53.832
The aliens, I think, would be shocked.
“为何人类对气候变化 其严重性毫无头绪？”

19
00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:56.540
"Why don't people know what's happening or how bad it is?
“应该有人告诉他们!”

20
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.832
Someone should tell them!"
这种荒谬是如此地清晰和真实。

21
00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:04.606
The absurdity of the situation is so clear and so real.
面对气候变化， 我们的沟通非常失败。

22
00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:04.872
What we have here is a failure to communicate.
我的工作是教育大家有关气候变化。

23
00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:07.582
My job is to educate people about climate change.
因此我搜查了相关的 概念、信息、图像和术语，

24
00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:11.498
So I look at the concepts, the messages, the images and the terms,
再将它们测试于数百万人。

25
00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:13.582
and I test them with millions of people.
我想告诉你们 我的发现。

26
00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:15.498
I'd like to tell you what I'm learning.
对很多人来说，

27
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.748
For so many people,
气象变化是抽象、遥远的， 大得无法想像。

28
00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.748
climate change seems abstract, distant, too big to imagine.
我们经常用来形容它的词汇，如：

29
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.706
The words we often use to describe it --
排放量，二氧化碳， 甲烷，净零，人为--

30
00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:27.998
emissions, CO2, methane, net zero, anthropogenic --
简单来说，这些术语令人困惑。

31
00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.706
are, simply put, confusing.
没有多少人会清晨起床说：

32
00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:32.289
Not that many people wake up in the morning and say,
“今天是脱碳化的好日子。”

33
00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.664
"It's a great day for some decarbonisation."
这些词汇并不能让我们 了解气候变化，

34
00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:38.123
These words become obstacles rather than gateways to understanding,
他们阻碍我们，更别说关心了。

35
00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.414
let alone caring.
解决这个沟通失败的方法

36
00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.498
The way to fix this failure to communicate
不是从探讨问题开始，

37
00:01:41.498 --> 00:01:44.081
is to start not by talking about the issue,
而是从人开始， 先从个人开始思考，

38
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.039
but to start with people, to think first about individuals,
那些脑子里有成千上万其他事情的人，

39
00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.873
the people who have millions of other things on their mind,
成千上万的担忧、 挑战、希望和抱负。

40
00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:52.956
a million worries and challenges and hopes and aspirations.
气候变化是人类有史以来 面临的最大威胁之一，

41
00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:56.331
Climate change is one of the biggest threats humanity has ever faced,
如果人们不在乎，

42
00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:57.664
and we won't face it,
我们则没法正视问题,

43
00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:59.539
not to the degree that's necessary,
无法面对它。

44
00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:03.940
if people don't care.
为气候信息通报 实施以人为本的方法

45
00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.998
The people-first approach to climate communications
需要三个简单条件：

46
00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.914
demands three simple things.
第一是简单明了的共同语言。

47
00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:10.331
The first one is plain, obvious and universal language.
可以肯定的是， 人们不会轻易了解

48
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.249
One thing for sure people don't readily get --
二氧化碳排放或净零，

49
00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.249
carbon emissions, net zero --
这些在科学书中可以找到的术语。

50
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.706
are most terms that can be found in a science book.
坦率地说，对外行人来说， 这些词听起来并没那么糟

51
00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.415
And frankly, to the uninitiated, much of it doesn't really sound that bad.
比如说：“50 年内升温两度”，

52
00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:23.582
"Two degrees warmer in 50 years,"
或是听起太过糟糕 让人们摸不着头脑，

53
00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:26.624
or it sounds so bad, you can't even get your head around it --
比如“1.2 万亿吨冰。”

54
00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:28.415
"1.2 trillion tons of ice."
迷惑和绝望是对 了解一件事情的敌人。

55
00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.957
Confusion and hopelessness are the enemies of understanding.
一个好的语言测试是， 当你听到此事时，脑海中会想起什么？

56
00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.457
A good test for language is, what pops into your head when you hear it.
如果你听到 ”气候变化“ 这一术语， 你会想到什么？

57
00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.707
If you hear a term like "climate change," what pops into your head?
对大多数人来说， 答案是 “想不到什么”。

58
00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:41.165
Well, for most people, the answer is "not much."
这语言不生动。

59
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.457
The language isn't vivid.
我们需要的是每个人 都能明白的生动语言。

60
00:02:42.457 --> 00:02:45.124
What we need is vivid language that everyone gets.
值得注意的是，好多人实际上

61
00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:48.124
It's remarkable how many people actually confuse climate change
将气候变化与臭氧层空洞 混为一谈.

62
00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:49.290
with the ozone hole.
十个美国人中， 有超过四人

63
00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:50.957
More than four in 10 Americans
认为全球变暖是由 臭氧层空洞导致的。

64
00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.624
think the ozone hole actually causes global warming.
而其中非常多人对臭氧层耗竭

65
00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:55.874
And so many of them remember and understand
有着很多的了解和记忆。

66
00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:58.040
so much about ozone depletion.
为什么？

67
00:02:58.082 --> 00:02:59.207
Why is that?
因为它是个洞，是一层臭氧。

68
00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:04.649
Because it's a hole, it's a layer.
人们可以看到它， 想像它，与它产生直接关联。

69
00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:04.665
People can see it, imagine it, relate to it.
它是个简单的比喻， 让人茅塞顿开。

70
00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:07.915
It uses simple metaphor that's an instant get.
我们来个对气候变化

71
00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:10.249
Here's a little story that gets a similar "aha"
带出类似 “噢！” 的故事。

72
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.499
for climate change.
人类在地球上活了大约 30 万年，

73
00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.457
Humans have been on Earth for about 300,000 years,
但我们从 60 年前 才开始如此污染地球。

74
00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:17.499
but we've only started polluting like this in about the last 60.
我们造成的污染在 空气中停留了数千年，

75
00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.124
Our pollution stays in the air for thousands of years,
形成一层厚厚的毯子， 将热量困在大气层里。

76
00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:23.207
creating a thickening blanket that traps heat in the atmosphere.
热量导致更强大的暴风雨、

77
00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.290
That heat causes stronger hurricanes,
更大的火灾、更频繁的洪水、

78
00:03:25.332 --> 00:03:27.790
bigger fires, more frequent floods
和数千物种的灭绝。

79
00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.999
and the extinction of thousands of species.
但是有个好消息。

80
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.207
But there's good news.
为了停止污染毯子，

81
00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:32.790
To stop the pollution blanket,
我们只需要停止污染。

82
00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:34.499
we just have to stop polluting.
这个 “污染毯子” 的框架经测试

83
00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:39.165
This "pollution blanket" framing is one of the most effective we've tested
是让人们了解气候变化问题 最有效的的方法之一。

84
00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:41.207
at getting people to understand the issue.
它具有视觉和生动力，

85
00:03:41.207 --> 00:03:42.915
It's visual, it's vivid,
当人们听到这个消息后 会变得更加投入。

86
00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:46.374
and when people hear the message, they become significantly more engaged.
他们明白了。

87
00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:47.582
They get it.
有很多其他日常词语和概念

88
00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:50.249
There are so many other regular speak words and concepts
是与人们息息相关的。

89
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.624
that stick with people.
与其用 “变暖”，

90
00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:53.207
Instead of "warming,"
不如尝试 “过热”。

91
00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.790
try "overheating."
与其用 “气候”， 不如说 “极端天气”。

92
00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:57.749
Instead of "climate," talk about "extreme weather."
当提到 “清洁能源“，

93
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.457
When mentioning "clean energy,"
你也可以说 “廉价能源”， 因为它正迅速变得便宜。

94
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:05.983
you might say "cheap energy" as well, as it's rapidly becoming cheap.
“不可逆转” 这个词汇 非常引人注目，

95
00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:05.999
The word "irreversible" really gets people's attention,
因为污染肯定也如此。

96
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.874
as the pollution certainly is.
如果你绝对要谈论温度升高

97
00:04:07.874 --> 00:04:10.665
And if you absolutely must talk about temperature increases
而你是住在美国的话，

98
00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:11.874
and you live in the US,
看在老天爷的份上， 请用华氏度！

99
00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:13.832
heck, use Fahrenheit for goodness sake.
它能使严重性加倍。

100
00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:14.999
It doubles the severity.
“你孩子人生中的 9 华氏度”  听起来很严重。

101
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.082
"Nine degrees during your kid's lifetime" sounds pretty serious.
“0.5 摄氏度才能满足巴黎协定” 则听起来非常微不足道。

102
00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:21.915
"One point five degrees Celsius to meet the Paris Accord" is pretty ignorable.
这是关于超越少数人 能明白的政策语言

103
00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:25.456
This is about going beyond arcane policy language
将它们转化为 人们凭直觉就能懂的语言。

104
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.206
into language that we all intuitively get.
这就是第一步：认知。

105
00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:28.207
That's the first step: understanding.
但没有相关性的认知是迷茫的。

106
00:04:28.207 --> 00:04:30.706
That's the first step: understanding.
因此，第二个关键

107
00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:33.165
But understanding without relevance is rudderless.
是将气候变化变成

108
00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.040
So the second key then
对你个人生活特别重要的一件事。

109
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.831
is to make climate feel like something that matters to you,
没有人会对政策建议产生顿悟。

110
00:04:37.874 --> 00:04:40.290
to your life, individually and personally.
觉醒是个人的。

111
00:04:40.665 --> 00:04:43.165
Nobody has an epiphany about policy proposals.
它们具有地方相关性。

112
00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:44.374
Awakenings are personal.
它们是关于你的生活和你的顾虑。

113
00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:45.706
They have local relevance.
举个例子，我们将以下两条信息 展示给几千位在佛罗里达的居民。

114
00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:47.748
They're about your life and your concerns.
其中一个要求他们 “诉求实现零排放，以阻止气候变化。”

115
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.540
As an example, we presented two messages to a few thousand people in Florida.
另一条则简单地写道: “阻止我们所受的洪灾“。

116
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:55.373
One asked them "to demand that we get to zero emissions to stop climate change."
后者信息得到了人们四倍以上的关注。

117
00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:05.108
Another simply said, "Stop my flooding."
比起全球变暖， 当地洪灾与居民更相关。

118
00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:07.358
The latter message was over four times more effective in getting their attention.
我们需要的 不是更好的政策说明，

119
00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.124
Local flooding was so much more relevant than global warming.
而是更深、更多的个人联系。

120
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:07.374
What's needed isn't better policy descriptions,
我再给个例子。

121
00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.581
but rather deeper, more personal connections.
我再给个例子。

122
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:09.582
Here's another example.
我们与一群杰出的女性气候科学家合作，

123
00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:10.915
Here's another example.
以帮助放大她们 作为信使的声音。

124
00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:14.040
We work with a team of remarkable women climate scientists
她们致力于研究气候这个问题：

125
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.456
to help elevate their voice as messengers.
研发复杂的计算模型 来了解北极的进程；

126
00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:19.248
They've dedicated their careers to studying the issue,
还会乘飞机测量野火烟雾中的氮。

127
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.624
developing complex computational models to understand the Arctic processes,
他们可以告诉你 所有你需要知道的科学知识，

128
00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:27.081
and climbing into planes to measure nitrogen in wildfire smoke.
但当问他们 为什么研究气候变化时，

129
00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:30.248
They could tell you everything you need to know about the science,
他们谈到了自己的儿女，

130
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.831
but what we asked them about was why they study it.
谈到了想要把一个安全、 健康和蓬勃生机的世界

131
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.707
And they told us about their daughters and their sons,
留给他们的孩子。

132
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.790
about wanting to keep the world safe and healthy and vibrant
当我们和其他父母 分享这些个人故事时，

133
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:39.998
for their children.
相比盯着全球气温图表，

134
00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.874
And when we shared these personal stories with other parents,
他们会因此更关心气候变化，

135
00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:45.624
they started to care far more deeply about climate change
他们会因此更关心气候变化，

136
00:05:45.624 --> 00:05:48.540
than they did from staring at charts of global temperatures.
大家会看到 父母为了孩子

137
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.706
People see a parent who's dedicated their life
贡献了一生来制造 更美好的世界。

138
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.790
to creating a better world for their child.
贡献了一生来制造 更美好的世界。

139
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.331
Every parent can relate to that.
这是每位父母都可以关联到的。

140
00:05:54.374 --> 00:05:55.707
It matters to me.
这对我很重要。

141
