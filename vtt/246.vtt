15
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.957
and I believe we need to take them to the next level,

36
00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:01.939
What this means is that, while regular acrylic

37
00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.287
only diffuses light around the edges,

45
00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:28.790
that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:40.638
is, amongst other things, in baby bottles,
这种材料主要应用于婴儿奶瓶的制造。

53
00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:56.956
and technologies we use on a daily basis.

60
00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:17.989
so why am I here today talking about smart materials?

61
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.702
Well first of all, because I am a maker.

69
00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:44.598
There's barely any information available on how to use them,

70
00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:48.495
and very little is said about how they are produced.
至于它们是如何制造的信息就更加少得可怜。

71
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.162
So for now, they exist mostly in this realm

72
00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:53.874
of trade secrets and patents

87
00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:41.590
First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,

（音乐："Happy Together"）

148
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.587
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,
在麻省理工学院教授Marcelo Coelho研究的基础上，

149
00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:51.370
Hannah created a series of paper speakers
Hannah使用各种材料

150
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.773
out of a wide range of materials
包括普通的铜带、导电的纺织品和墨水等，

151
00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:58.048
from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.
创造了一系列纸质扬声器。

152
00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:00.784
Just like Jordan and so many other makers,
就像Jordan和其他很多制造者一样，

153
00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:02.411
Hannah published her recipes

154
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:07.545
and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
使得任何人可以模仿或重复这些实验。

155
00:08:07.545 --> 00:08:10.749
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches

156
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:12.556
of material science
最有前景的分支之一，

157
00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:16.758
in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.
因为它让我们能创造出便宜又灵活的电子产品。

158
00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:19.314
So Hannah's artisanal work,
所以Hannah的手工作品，

159
00:08:19.314 --> 00:08:21.562
and the fact that she shared her findings,
以及她分享了她的发现这个事实，

160
00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:25.382
opens the doors to a series of new possibilities
为我们打开了一扇，

161
00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:30.822
that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.
通向兼具美学和创新的无限可能的大门。

162
00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:33.727
So the interesting thing about makers
制造者的有趣之处在于

163
00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:36.770
is that we create out of passion and curiosity,
我们创造是出于热情和好奇，

164
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.849
and we are not afraid to fail.
并且我们不害怕失败。

165
00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:42.737
We often tackle problems from unconventional angles,
我们通常从非传统的角度处理问题，

166
00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:45.726
and, in the process, end up discovering alternatives
并且，在这个过程中，发现其他方案

167
00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:48.158
or even better ways to do things.
或者更好的方法。

168
00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:51.926
So the more people experiment with materials,
所以当更多的人愿意用新材料做试验的时候，

169
00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:55.402
the more researchers are willing to share their research,
更多的研究者就会愿意分享他们的研究成果；

170
00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.842
and manufacturers their knowledge,
有更多的制造商分享他们的知识，

171
00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:00.682
the better chances we have to create technologies
我们就更有可能

172
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:03.620
that truly serve us all.
创造出造福我们所有人的科技。

173
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.113
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have
所以我的感觉有一点像Ted Nelson

174
00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:09.824
when, in the early 1970s, he wrote,
在70年代初期的感觉一样，他写道，

175
00:09:09.824 --> 00:09:12.822
"You must understand computers now."
“你们现在必需懂电脑。”

176
00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:16.676
Back then, computers were these large mainframes
那个时候，电脑是只有科学家关心的

177
00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:18.806
only scientists cared about,
大型机器，

178
00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:21.526
and no one dreamed of even having one at home.
没有人会想到能够在家拥有一台。

179
00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:24.502
So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,
所以我今天站在这里说

180
00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:27.542
"You must understand smart materials now."
“你们现在必需懂智能材料”有一点奇怪。

181
00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:31.278
Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge

182
00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:33.542
about emerging technologies
