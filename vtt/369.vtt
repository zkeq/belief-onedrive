Shah Rukh Khan: Be it Mumbai or Delhi, Chennai or Kolkata,
无论是孟买还是德里，是金奈还是加尔各答，

2
00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:17.287
all our big cities have one great thing in common,
我们所有的大城市都有一个共同点，

3
00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:23.766
they happily welcome people from  smaller places arriving in search of work.
这些大城市都欢迎外地人来找工作，

4
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.004
What is also true is that this warm welcome leads to consequences.
但这如此温暖的欢迎也会带来许多危机。

5
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.647
Problems like housing in these cities are born.
像是住房紧缺的问题也随之而来。

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.172
Today we have with us a human settlement expert and researcher: Dr. Gautam Bhan,
今天，人居环境专家和研究者古塔姆巴汗教授将为我们分享

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:41.350
who is re-imagining a solution to this increasing problem.
对于这一日益严峻的问题的解决方法，

8
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.846
He will share with us the new picture of urban India that he can see.
他会为我们分享他眼中创新的印度城市蓝图，

(Applause)
（掌声）

12
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.320
Gautam Bhan: In this country, until a few years ago,
在印度，不知从几年前起，

13
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.915
if you asked someone:
如果你问某人：

14
00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:08.796
"Where are you from?"
“你来自哪里？”

15
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.046
the answer would be Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata.
他们都会回答德里，孟买，加尔各答。

16
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.418
You'd immediately ask again:
然后你马上就会问：

17
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.753
"Where do you belong?"
“那你是属于哪里呢？”

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.435
Until recently in India, nobody was from a city;
在不久之前，还没有多少人是真正来自这些城市；

19
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.046
people only migrated to the city.
他们多半是迁移于此。

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.447
This is changing.
这是一大改变。

21
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.221
Urbanization is changing India,
城市化正在改变着印度，

22
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.270
but are our cities prepared?
但是我们的城市准备好应对这一改变了吗？

23
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.680
Let's assume you were born somewhere else.
我们假设你是出生于别处，

24
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.602
Your parents worked as laborers all day.
你的父母在城里打工，

25
00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.639
Then you too would have come to a city for progress.
所以你随父母搬到了大城市，

26
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.151
Or maybe, like it happens today, you were born in the city itself.
或者就像今天发生的，你就恰巧出生在了大城市，

27
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.710
One day you go out looking for an accommodation in the city,
总有一天，你要独立地在城市中寻找属于自己的住所，

28
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.350
to buy or maybe just to rent.
去买房，或者只是租房。

29
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.606
Will you be able find an affordable home?
你能够找到一个你负担得起的家吗?

30
00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:05.718
The government says we are falling short of at least 20 million homes.
政府说我们还缺少至少 2000 万间住所，

31
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.866
20 million homes, that's 100 million people.
2000 万个住所，那就是 1 亿的人民的家。

32
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.896
And this is not the shortage of 3 BHKs (bedroom hall kitchen).
这不是说只缺 3 BHKs （三室一厅一厨房格局），

33
00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:19.623
95 percent of the shortage is for people earning 10 to 15,000 rupees per month.
95% 的住房短缺针对的是每月收入10到15000卢比的人。

34
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:24.270
Will you be able to find an affordable home in this budget?
这笔预算能让你找到一个负担得起的家吗?

35
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.733
If this happened with you, what would you do?
如果这发生在你身上，你会怎么做?

36
00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:28.997
Home is not a car or some sort of jewellery.
我说的家，不是一辆车，更不是首饰珠宝，

37
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.010
Home is food and clothes.
家是能吃得饱、冻不着的地方，

38
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.228
Nobody can live without it.
没有人能居无住所。

39
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.726
If you couldn't find a home in a city to either buy or rent,
如果你不能在城市里找到一个家，不管是买还是租，

40
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.163
you too would be driven to do what most people end up doing.
你就不得不去做大部分人必须做的事，

41
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.707
Make a home wherever possible.
不管怎么样都要寻找一个容身之处。

42
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.358
You too would make a settlement.
你也要有一个落脚的地方，

43
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.550
The government may keep calling it a slum,
政府称之为贫民窟，

44
00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.406
but like the people living there,
但就像那些住在里面的人，

45
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.344
I too will call it a settlement.
我会把它称之为聚居地。

46
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.369
One hundred million are not homeless.
这一亿人民不是无家可归，

47
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.543
They have homes.
他们有家，

48
00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:03.093
Homes they built on their own.
他们靠自己的双手创造的家，

49
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:06.203
But most of these homes are in settlements.
但是其中大多数家只能算是个聚居地。

50
00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:10.899
This is the truth of an affordable home in India.
在印度，这就是“可负担的家”的真相。

51
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.594
The homes in settlements are cheap, but not sturdy.
这些聚居地很便宜，设施却很简陋。

52
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.751
The homes outside are sturdy, but not cheap.
外面世界的家很完美，却一点也不便宜。

53
00:03:18.987 --> 00:03:22.011
(Applause)
（掌声）

54
00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:25.708
We will have to lay the foundation of a new thought from here itself.
从这里开始，我们要为新点子埋下种子。

55
00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:30.369
A settlement is not a problem; it is a solution.
聚居地不应该变成一个问题，而应该成为一个解决的办法。

56
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.834
We just have to make it secure and sturdy.
我们要做的仅仅是让它们变得安全而坚固。

57
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.409
To fulfill the shortage of 20 million homes
为了填补这 2000 万短缺的住房，

58
00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:42.085
you cannot make 20 million 25 square foot flats,
你没法创造出 2000 万间25平方英尺的公寓，

59
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.842
and neither should you be making them.
你也不应该去建造它们。

60
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.404
For example take the Karnataka government.
就拿卡纳塔克邦政府为例，

61
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.424
They have a very good record in this.
他们就在这方面做出了很好的表率。

62
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.214
By 2020, Karnataka needs 2.6 million homes.
到 2020 年，卡纳塔克邦需要 2600 万个住所，

63
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.590
In the last ten years they have managed to make 350,000 homes.
在过去的十年里，他们只完成了 35 万个住房。

64
00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:06.336
Even if a government tries with complete sincerity,
即使政府带着解决问题的诚意，

65
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.526
it cannot fulfill this need in the next couple of lifetimes.
这个目标还是遥不可及。

66
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.380
If we do not make new homes,
如果我们不去创造新的聚居地，

67
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.652
then what is the next solution?
那下一个解决之策又能是什么呢？

68
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.456
How to make a settlement secure?
怎样才能让这些聚居地变得安全起来？

69
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.419
Firstly, eviction needs to be stopped.
首先，先停下无休止的驱逐，

70
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.423
Bulldozing needs to be stopped.
强制拆除的方案也应该停下。

71
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.159
Never has that resulted in progress in the past,
这些都是无用功，

72
00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.428
nor will it in the future.
无论是在过去还是未来。

73
00:04:26.743 --> 00:04:31.085
(Applause)
（掌声）

74
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.286
We have to start believing that the laborers who build and run the city
我们必须坚信，因为有了这些劳动力，我们的城市才得以运转，

75
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.770
have a right over the land of that city.
而他们在城市里也应当拥有属于自己的权利。

76
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.925
(Applause)
（掌声）

77
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.846
I know you are thinking
我知道你们一定在想，

78
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.762
that settlements are made on illegally captured land,
这些贫民窟都是非法占用土地，

79
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.326
but capturing of land never happens in the dead of the night.
但是别忘了，没人会在死气沉沉的夜晚去偷窃土地。

80
00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:55.023
Whether the land belongs to the government or not,
不论这块地是不是属于政府，

81
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.130
a settlement is never formed secretly.
一个聚居地从来不是悄悄地出现的。

82
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.124
It is inhabited over time.
它是长久以来一直有人居住着的。

83
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.006
The government also agrees that
政府也一直默认它们的存在，

84
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.206
the settlements in our cities have been there for over 10, 20, 30, even 40 years.
这些聚居地至少在大城市里存在了 10 年、20 年、30 年，甚至40年。

85
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.336
What kind of illegally captured land is this,
这算是什么非法占用土地，

86
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.126
which was ignored for 30 years
可以被忽视 30 年之久，

87
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.510
and suddenly a day before eviction is declared illegal?
然后忽然在驱逐的前一天被认定是非法占用土地？

88
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.806
A settlement can easily accommodate 15 to 60 percent of a city's population
一个小小的聚居地足以容纳我们城市 15%-60% 的人口，

89
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.006
by using just one, two or maximum ten percent of the land.
它需要的仅仅是 1%、2% 或是最多10%的土地。

90
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.710
Can such a huge number of people not have a right over this small bit of land?
为什么这么多人民连拥有如此小小一片土地的权利都没有呢?

91
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.729
A city's progress is often measured by the cost of its land.
一个城市的发展往往以一片土地的价值来衡量，

92
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.557
How do you ascribe a cost to the life of a person living on a piece of land?
但是你又该如何衡量一片土地能给予一个人容身之处的价值呢？

93
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.580
A settlement is not asking you for shiny homes;
一个聚居地不意味着要你去建一个豪华的家；

94
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.894
all it's asking for is basic necessities:
它只不过是可以提供正常生活的必须条件：

95
00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:49.148
electricity, roads, water, toilets and drainage.
水电，道路，厕所和下水道。

96
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.726
We call this upgradation.
我们称之为设施改善。

97
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.801
Here's an example of upgradation.
举一个设施改善的例子：

98
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.837
In Ahmedabad, they started a program
在艾哈迈达巴德，他们启动了一个项目，

99
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.024
where for ten years, 44 settlements were promised there wouldn't be any eviction.
这个项目保证十年之内 44 个聚居地不会受到驱逐的威胁——

100
00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.605
Only a promise.
这仅仅只是一个保证，

101
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.000
Nothing written, no documents.
没有记录，更没有存档——

102
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.808
And basic necessities were provided to them.
然后提供给那里的人们基础生活必需品。

103
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.371
In ten years that slum changed into a locality, a place, a world of its own.
十年以后，这个贫民窟变成了一个地区、一个属于他们自己的世界，

104
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.643
The government didn't have to build even a single new home.
而政府完全不需要去为他们建一个新家了。

105
00:06:19.658 --> 00:06:24.193
(Applause)
（掌声）

106
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.050
Thailand launched this program at national scale,
泰国在全国范围内启动了这个项目，

107
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.162
benefiting 100,000 people in 137 cities.
137 个城市里的十万人民因此受益。

108
00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:37.314
And every person was given the right to live over that land.
每一个人都拥有了在这片土地上生活的权利。

109
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.073
But pay attention here.
但请注意，

110
00:06:39.618 --> 00:06:42.812
Not the right to sell, but the right to live there,
不是去出售这片土地的权利，仅仅是能居住在这里的权利，

111
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.916
use it, settle on it.
使用它，居住的权利。

112
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.366
The whole world knows now that to move forward,
全世界现在都知道要进步，

113
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.530
we cannot remove settlements.
我们或许不能清除贫民窟，

114
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.630
We can only advance when we think of ways to make settlements secure and sturdy.
我们却可以想办法让这些地方变得安全而坚固。

115
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.446
But just one thing.
但还有一件事，

116
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.965
If we know it, then why doesn't it happen?
如果我们知道了，那为什么没能实现？

117
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.561
To apply this new thinking to settlements,
为了让这一新的设想实现，

118
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:17.390
we, that is you and me, need to look deep within and get rid of the disgust, disrespect and apprehensions that we have.
我们，也就是你们和我，都需要了解并摆脱心中那些厌恶、不敬和恐惧的态度，

119
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.357
Actually I should not be standing here in front of you today.
我甚至觉得今天我都不应该站在这里，

120
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.770
A person from the settlement who lives there should be standing here.
真正应该站在这里的应当是一个生活在那里的人。

121
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.997
But if someone like that came here, you wouldn't have listened to him.
但是如果真的是那样的话，我觉得你们甚至都不像听他讲了。

122
00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:37.921
You are listening to me, because you think I am not from a settlement.
你们听我讲，因为你们觉得我不是来自聚居地，

123
00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:41.726
This is the very thought that needs to be changed.
这就是我们需要去改变的想法。

124
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.736
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

125
00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:50.036
(Applause)
（掌声）

126
00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:53.482
SRK: Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Gautam Bhan.

127
00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:54.349
Thanks a lot.
非常感谢。

128
00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.226
Please tell me, you just gave an example of Thailand
请你告诉我，你刚刚为我们分享了泰国的例子。

129
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.400
and the big thing there is
最精彩的部分是，

130
00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:04.376
the homes are for people to settle in, not to sell.
家不应该是为了出售，而是为了提供容身之所。

131
00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:06.899
They cannot be used for sale.
它们的存在不应该是为了出售。

132
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.799
Is there a similar thought process or program in our country too,
那么在印度是不是也有相似的项目

133
00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:14.341
inspired by your talks and those of people around you?
是受到了你和你身边的人的启发？

134
00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:16.406
GB: I wouldn't say by me,
古塔姆：我不会说只是因为我，

135
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:22.151
but by the people movement who are fighting for rights in the city.
我会说是受到了为这城市里的人权奋斗的无数人的启发，

136
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:23.995
That is making a difference.
是他们实现了这种改变。

it should be called an economic development strategy.
