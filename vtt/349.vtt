I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong

step off the Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon.

and I've never seen anything like it since.

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:40.433

John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.321
we would still be dreaming about it.

are the great and fading lessons of Apollo.
是阿波罗计划留给我们深刻却渐渐淡化的一堂课。

And they are what give the word "moonshot" its meaning.

And our world is in desperate need of political leaders

to come out when that was really dangerous,

and of our children holding this headline

I never dreamed could ever be printed about the Supreme Court ruling.

38
00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:56.638
But I want to talk about the need for us to dream in more than one dimension,
但是我想以不同的角度，讨论我们需要梦想的必要性。

39
00:02:56.662 --> 00:03:02.068
because there was something about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8,

40
00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:06.353

“如果我们都不能够填平人与人之间的巨大隔阂我们通过登月又能获得什么呢？”

54
00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:13.257

00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:43.373
It destroys our own inner capacity for peace."

Too often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations on some future

that destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now.

or you can have stability in your family life.

在同一時間，鱼与熊掌不可兼得。

69
00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:30.375
And we don't set the bar much higher than stability when it comes to our emotional life.
而且说到感情生活的时候我们也不敢奢望太多，简单稳定即可。

70
00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:36.128
Which is why our technology for talking to one another has gone vertical,
所以帮助我们与他人交流的科技一直呈指数式增长

71
00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:41.052
our ability to listen and understand one another has gone nowhere.

our access to joy, grounded.

一般认爲，我们的现在和未来不可兼得，

75
00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:06.341
that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender our profound potential for being,
如果要实现我们的潜力就要放弃当下，

76
00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:10.276
that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,
电路版上的晶体管数可以翻倍再翻倍，

77
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.602
but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love
但是我们的同情心、人性、平常心和爱卻是有限的，

78
00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:16.704
is somehow limited

79
00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:19.694
is a false and suffocating choice.
是自掘坟墓的选择。

80
00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:23.869
Now, I'm not suggesting
我不是在陈词滥调地建议

81
00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:29.521
simply the uninspiring idea of more work-life balance.
保持工作生活平衡。

82
00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:37.083
What good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home if my mind is always somewhere else while I'm doing it?

83
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.385
I'm not even talking about mindfulness.
我现在也不是在讲专注。

84
00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.781
Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity.
专注突然就变成了提高效率的工具。

85
00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:48.110
(Laughter)

I'm talking about an audacious authenticity

91
00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:07.348
that allows us to cry with one another,

92
00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:13.646
a heroic humility that allows us to remove our masks and be real.
我在讨论一种伟大的谦逊让我们摘下面具，真诚相待。

93
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.195
It is our inability to be with one another,
正是因为我们缺乏互相沟通的能力

94
00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:20.553
our fear of crying with one another, that gives rise to so many

95
00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:23.871
of the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place,

96
00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:27.195

98
00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:35.255
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk called an Epoch B,

99
00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:40.890
a new epoch in which we become as excited about and curious about

100
00:07:40.914 --> 00:07:44.923
and scientific about the development of our humanity
还是对于人性的发展

101
00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:47.542
as we are about the development of our technology.
都无比的激动，无比的好奇，无比的理性。

102
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:54.415
We should not shrink from this opportunity simply because we don't really understand it.
我们不能因为不了解就放弃这样的机会。

103
00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:57.792
There was a time when we didn't understand space.
以前我们也不了解太空，

104
00:07:57.632 --> 00:08:02.970
Or because we're more used to technology and activism.
但不能因为我们对于所知的科技和行动主义比加熟悉就要放弃了解太空。

105
00:08:01.994 --> 00:08:05.265
That is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone.
这无疑是画地为牢。

106
00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:10.923
We are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement.
我们现在很舒服地幻想不可思议的科技进步。

107

In 2016, it is the dimension of our being itself
在2016年，我们急需我们的人性

108
00:08:15.837 --> 00:08:20.967
that cries out for its fair share of our imagination.
在我们的梦想之中占据一席之地。

109
00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:25.927
Now, we're all here to dream,

each of us chasing our own dream.

00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:34.126
You know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream,
当我们环顾周围人的名牌，看看有谁可以帮我完成梦想的时候，

113
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.246
sometimes looking right through one another's humanity.
我们有时候会忽略了名牌背后的那个灵魂，

Years ago, once upon a time, I had this beautiful company

118
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.110
that created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement.

119
00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.514
And we had this mantra:
我们的座右铭是：

120
00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:00.355
"Human. Kind. Be Both."
“与人为善，于己为善“

121
00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:06.895
And we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness.
我们鼓励大家积极行善，

122
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:10.180
Like, "Go help everybody set up their tents."

And there were a lot of tents.

00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:22.441
even though you know the dinner line is going to get longer."

128
00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:24.839
And people really took us up on this,
人们真的开始这样积极地帮忙

129
00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:27.490
so much so that if you got a flat tire on the AIDS ride,
以至于如果你在为艾滋病骑行的过程中爆胎了

130
00:09:27.514 --> 00:09:32.315
you had trouble fixing it, because there were so many people there asking you if you needed help.
你很难去修好它，因为太多的人在询问你是否需要帮忙。

131
00:09:33.165 --> 00:09:39.112
For a few days, for tens of thousands of people, we created these worlds

132
00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:43.342
that everybody said were the way they wish the world could always be.

134
00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:52.305
these next few days?
我们会得到什么结果呢？

135
00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:57.785
And instead of going up to someone and asking them, "What do you do?"
与其找到别人问他：“你是做什么的？”

136
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.084
ask them, "So what are your dreams?"
不如问他们：“你有什么梦想？”

137
00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:04.103
or "What are your broken dreams?"

138
00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:09.983
You know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams.

139
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.419

140
00:10:15.443 --> 00:10:17.999
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober"
也许梦想就是“我想要戒酒”

141
00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:20.689
or "I want to build a tree house with my kid."
或者“我想和我的孩子建造一个树屋”。

142
00:10:21.332 --> 00:10:24.524
You know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet,
与其去趋炎附势，

143
00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:26.305
go up to the person who is all alone
不如雪中送炭，

144
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:29.016
and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee.
问问那些孤独的人是否需要一杯咖啡。

145
00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:32.840
I think what we fear most
我想我们最害怕的是，

146
00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:37.220
is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential,
我们自己放弃了我们与生俱来

147
00:10:37.244 --> 00:10:39.855
that we are born to dream
可以真正实现我们潜力的梦想，

148
00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:43.491
and we might die without ever having the chance.
害怕我们至死都不曾一试。

149
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.078
Imagine living in a world
想像一下在一个世界中，

150
00:10:47.102 --> 00:10:53.299
where we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another
尽管我们意识到了那深深存在的恐惧，

151
00:10:52.773 --> 00:10:56.455
and love one another boldly because we know
我们仍然勇敢地深爱着彼此

152
00:10:56.479 --> 00:11:00.042
that to be human is to live with that fear.
因为我们知道要得到人生的真谛，必须学会与这种恐惧共存。

153
00:11:01.613 --> 00:11:07.161
It's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously,
是时候让我们同时从不同的方向一起梦想，

154
00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:15.724
and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things we can and will and must do
在我们尽我们所能不停地追寻并实现我们远大的梦想之后，

155
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:21.907
lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be.
我们会得到人生的真谛。

156
00:11:23.568 --> 00:11:27.026
It's time we set foot into that dimension
是时候让我们朝新的方向探索

157
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.803
and came out about the fact that we have dreams there, too.
并开始实现我们的梦想了。

158
00:11:33.034 --> 00:11:35.899
If the Moon could dream,
如果月亮能梦想

159
00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:41.772
I think that would be its dream for us.
我想它的梦想会跟我们一样。

160
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.999
