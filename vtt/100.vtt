And we wanted to call our pediatrician,

When we got to the doctor's office the next day,

I should've spoken up, but I didn't.

我是在10年多以前，当我让我的 双胞胎兄弟失望的时候，学会的。

but they also make up a universal tapestry.

And through these experiences, I've come to recognize

48
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.377
that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior.
我们每个人都是有一个 可接受行为范围的。

49
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:34.652
Now, sometimes we're too strong; we push ourselves too much.

50
00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.439
That's what happened with my brother.

Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior.

But sometimes we're too weak.

That's what happened with my wife and I.

当我们跨出范围圈的时候， 我们就会受到不同形式的惩罚。

We get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized.

58
00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:01.093
Or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal.
我们失去加薪或晋升，或是一笔交易。

59
00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.513
Now, the first thing we need to know is:

60
00:03:04.537 --> 00:03:06.025
What is my range?

62
00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:12.501
it's actually pretty dynamic.

63

It expands and it narrows based on the context.

64
00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:21.292
And there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else,

65
00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:23.151

In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives.

70

they had power.

where someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate.

where one person's more invested than the other person.
一个人比另一个人投入更多

82
00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:58.657
And the key thing is that when we have lots of power,

83
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:00.510
our range is very wide.

We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.

86
00:04:06.357 --> 00:04:08.152
We have very little leeway.
我们行动就变得局限。

87
00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:11.549
The problem is that when our range narrows,

88
00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:15.676
that produces something called the low-power double bind.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.803
The low-power double bind happens

when, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed,

and connected it with one thing, and that's gender.

94
00:04:30.885 --> 00:04:35.095
The gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed,

and women who do speak up get punished.

96
00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:42.931

关键是，女性有着 与男性同样的为自己说话的需求

97
00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:44.852
but they have barriers to doing so.

98
00:04:45.824 --> 00:04:49.102
But what my research has shown over the last two decades

99
00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:52.407
is that what looks like a gender difference

100
00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:55.252
is not really a gender double bind,

101
00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:57.632
it's a really a low-power double bind.
其实是弱势两难的问题。

102
00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.540
And what looks like a gender difference
那些表面上看似是性别差异

103
00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:02.670
are really often just power differences in disguise.
其实质只是实力差异伪装成的样子。

104
00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:05.937
Oftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman
很多时候，当我们看到 一位男性和一位女性之间的差距时，

105
00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:07.159
or men and women,
或者男性与女性之间，

106
00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:08.695
and think, "Biological cause. There's something fundamentally different
我们就会想，“生理因素。

107
00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:12.061
about the sexes."
两性在本质上就是不同的。”

108
00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:13.939
But in study after study,
但是在一个又一个的研究当中，

109
00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:18.169
I've found that a better explanation for many sex differences
我找到了一个能更好解释 很多案例中性别差距的原因

110
00:05:18.713 --> 00:05:20.225
is really power.
那就是实力。

111
00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.316
And so it's the low-power double bind.
所以把它称作弱势两难困境。

112
00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:28.611
And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range,
处于弱势两难就意味着 我们的可接受范围很窄

113
00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:30.465
and we lack power.

114
00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:31.721
We have a narrow range,
我们的可接受范围越窄，

and our double bind is very large.

116
00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:36.511
So we need to find ways to expand our range.

117
00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.112
And over the last couple decades,
在过去的几十年中，

118
00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:41.117
my colleagues and I have found two things really matter.
我和我的同事找到了 两个重要的影响因素

119
00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:45.712
The first: you seem powerful in your own eyes.
第一点：你在自己眼中是实力者。

120
00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:49.425
The second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others.
第二点：你在他人眼中是实力者。

121
00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.304
When I feel powerful,

When other people see me as powerful,

125
00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:00.970
they grant me a wider range.
他们就给予了我更广的可接受范围。

126
00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:05.748
So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior.

127
00:06:05.772 --> 00:06:08.163
And I'm going to give you a set of tools today.

128
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:09.805
Speaking up is risky,

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:14.252
but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up.

130

and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table.

But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered
但是汉娜·赖利·鲍里斯 和艾米丽·阿曼图拉发现

135
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:36.839
there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men

00:06:57.586 --> 00:07:01.534
when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice.
当我们为他人声张的时候， 我们就能发掘自己的声音。

144
00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:05.265
But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves.
但是有些时候， 我们必须为自己放声说。

145
00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:06.629
How do we do that?
我们应该怎么做呢？

146
00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:10.658
One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves
为自己讲话需要的 最重要的工具就是

147
00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:13.054
is something called perspective-taking.
一种叫做“换位思考”的东西。

148
00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:15.830
And perspective-taking is really simple:
“换位思考”其实很简单：

149
00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:20.139
it's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person.
就仅仅是通过另一个人的 眼睛看世界而已。

150
00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:24.622
It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range.
这是我们扩大自身可接受范围 的最重要的工具。

151
00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:26.353
When I take your perspective,
当我站在你的立场，

152
00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:28.816
and I think about what you really want,
去想你真正想要什么的时候，

153
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.210
you're more likely to give me what I really want.
你就更有可能给我，我真正想要的。

154
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.781
But here's the problem:
但是这有一个问题：

155
00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:37.086
perspective-taking is hard to do.
“换位思考”是一件很难的事情。

156
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.640
So let's do a little experiment.
让我们做一点儿实验。

157
00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:41.678
I want you all to hold your hand just like this:
我希望你们所有人都像这样， 把手举起来，

158
00:07:41.702 --> 00:07:42.997
your finger -- put it up.
把手指竖起来，

159
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.822
And I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead
我希望你们在自己的 额头上写一个大写的E

160
00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.427
as quickly as possible.
越快越好。

161
00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:55.203
OK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways,
好吧，结果表明我们 有两种不同的书写方法，

162
00:07:55.227 --> 00:07:58.712
and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking.
这就是原本用来测试 换位思考的实验。

163
00:07:58.736 --> 00:08:00.657
I'm going to show you two pictures
我要给你们展示两张人们

164
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.681
of someone with an E on their forehead --
在额头上写着E的图片－

165
00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:04.563
my former student, Erika Hall.
这是我以前的学生，艾丽卡·赫尓。

166
00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:07.082
And you can see over here,
你们在这里看到的，

167
00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.373
that's the correct E.
是正确的E。

168
00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:11.847
I drew the E so it looks like an E to another person.
我这样画E，所以其他人 就能把它认成E。

169
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:13.978
That's the perspective-taking E
这就是“换位思考”的E，

170
00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:17.057
because it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point.
因为它是别人眼中的E。

171
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:20.091
But this E over here is the self-focused E.
但是这边的E则是“自我中心”的E。

172
00:08:20.676 --> 00:08:22.329
We often get self-focused.
我们时常会以自我为中心。

173
00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.320
And we particularly get self-focused in a crisis.
特别是在危机情况下更容易。

174
00:08:25.884 --> 00:08:28.055
I want to tell you about a particular crisis.
我希望和你们谈谈 一次特别的危机。

175
00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:31.083
A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California.
一个男人走进一家位于加利福尼亚州， 沃森维尔市的银行。

176
00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:34.544
And he says, "Give me $2,000,
他说，“给我2000美金，

177
00:08:34.568 --> 00:08:36.864
or I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb."

178
00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:39.848
Now, the bank manager didn't give him the money.
而银行经理没有给他钱。

179
00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:41.171
She took a step back.
她退了一步。

180
00:08:41.693 --> 00:08:43.149
She took his perspective,

and she noticed something really important.

182
00:08:45.564 --> 00:08:48.270
He asked for a specific amount of money.

183
00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.499
So she said,
所以她说，

184
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:52.748
"Why did you ask for $2,000?"
“为什么你需要2000美金？”

185
00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:55.453
And he said, "My friend is going to be evicted
男人说，“如果不能立即拿到2000美金，

186
00:08:55.477 --> 00:08:57.740
unless I get him $2,000 immediately."
我的朋友就要被驱逐出境了。“

187
00:08:57.764 --> 00:09:00.814
And she said, "Oh! You don't want to rob the bank --
然后经理说， “哦，那你不是要抢银行－

188
00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:02.326
you want to take out a loan."
你是需要贷款。”

189
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.435
(Laughter)
（笑声）

190
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:05.332
"Why don't you come back to my office,
“为什么不跟我回到办公室，

191
00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:07.099
and we can have you fill out the paperwork."
我们就可以让你填好需要的文件。”

192
00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:08.598
(Laughter)
（笑声）

193
00:09:08.124 --> 00:09:13.706
Now, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation.
她的快速换位思考的 能力解除了一个危机形势。

194
00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:16.235
So when we take someone's perspective,
当我们能够从他人的角度看问题时，

195
00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:20.545
it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable.
我们就会变得有抱负， 自信，但同时招人喜欢。

196
00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:24.270
Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable,
还有另一种能让我们既自信， 又能招人喜欢的办法，

197
00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:26.825
and that is to signal flexibility.
那就是展现灵活性。

198
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:31.295
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car.
现在，想象自己是一名汽车销售员， 你要卖给别人一辆车。

199
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.613
You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options.
如果你能给他们两种选择， 你更容易卖出车。

200
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:37.384
Let's say option A:
比如选项A：

201
00:09:37.408 --> 00:09:40.508
$24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty.

203
00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:45.313
$23,000 and a three-year warranty.
两万三美金购车，三年免修。

204
00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:49.243
My research shows that when you give people a choice among options,
我的研究显示了，当你 给人们一些选择的余地时，

205
00:09:49.267 --> 00:09:51.156
it lowers their defenses,
他们会降低自我防范意识，

206
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.378
and they're more likely to accept your offer.
他们更容易接受你的邀请。

207
00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:56.139
And this doesn't just work with salespeople;
这不仅仅只在销售人员这里有用；

208
00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:57.354
it works with parents.
它在父母这里也有用。

209
00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:58.657
When my niece was four,
当我的侄女四岁的时候，

210
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.598
she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything.
她拒绝穿衣服，拒绝一切。

211
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.508
But then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea.

212
00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:07.450
What if I gave my daughter a choice?

This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.

214
00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:11.641
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.

216
00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:16.561
She got dressed quickly and without resistance.

217
00:10:16.988 --> 00:10:19.605

219
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.040
the number one answer is:
排名第一的回答是：

220
00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:27.818
"When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies."
“当我能在观众中得到支持； 当我有队友的时候。”

221
00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:31.388
So we want to get allies on our side.
所以我们希望有盟友支持自己。

222
00:10:31.777 --> 00:10:33.047
How do we do that?

223
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:35.830
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.
好吧，一种方式是做一只熊妈妈。

224
00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:37.330
When we advocate for others,
当我们为他人发声的时候，

225
00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:40.883
we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others,
我们就扩大了我们自己的范围， 也扩大了别人眼中的我们，

226
00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:43.063
but we also earn strong allies.
我们同时也得到了强有力的盟友。

227
00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:48.333
Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places,

228
00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:51.206
is by asking other people for advice.

229
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:57.111
When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them,

230
00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:58.622
and we're expressing humility.

231
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:02.297
And this really works to solve another double bind.

232
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:04.979
And that's the self-promotion double bind.

233
00:11:05.318 --> 00:11:06.822
The self-promotion double bind
自我推销两难

234
00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:10.001
is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments,

235
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:11.235
no one notices.
就没人会注意。

236
00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:13.663
And if we do, we're not likable.
如果我们宣传，我们就不讨喜。

237
00:11:13.687 --> 00:11:17.253
But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments,
但是如果我们就 自己的成就征求意见，

238
00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:21.587
we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable.
在他人眼中，我们就会 变得能干且讨人喜欢。

239
00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:24.322
And this is so powerful
这真的很有用，

240
00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:26.894
it even works when you see it coming.
甚至当你已经看穿这个策略时仍然有用

241
00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:31.329
There have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned
我人生中有很多次，我已经预先被人提醒过

242
00:11:31.353 --> 00:11:35.791
that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice.
有些实力不足的人 被建议来找我咨询

243
00:11:36.109 --> 00:11:38.351
I want you to notice three things about this:
我希望你们在此注意三点：

244
00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:41.363
First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice.
第一，我知道他们要来找我询问建议。

245
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.752
Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits
第二，我也研究过的征求意见的战略性好处。

246
00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:47.077
of asking for advice.
第三，这仍然管用！

247
00:11:47.702 --> 00:11:50.028
And three, it still worked!
我站在他们的角度，

248
00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.693
I took their perspective,
我在他们的诉求上花费更多的时间，

249
00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:53.904
I became more invested in their cause,
我更加关注他们， 因为他们向我寻求了帮助。

250
00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:57.734
I became more committed to them because they asked for advice.
另一种情况下， 我们也会有自信大声说，

251
00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:03.960
Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up
那就是当我们掌握了专业知识。

252
00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:03.510
is when we have expertise.
专业知识带给我们可信度。

253
00:12:03.964 --> 00:12:06.119
Expertise gives us credibility.
当我们实力强大的时候， 我们就已经拥有了可信度。

254
00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:09.609
When we have high power, we already have credibility.
我们只需要好的证据。

255
00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:11.098
We only need good evidence.
而我们实力不足的时候， 我们就没有可信度。

256
00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:14.567
When we lack power, we don't have the credibility.
我们就需要极佳的证据。

257
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.853
We need excellent evidence.
一种帮助我们被认作为专家的方式

258
00:12:17.214 --> 00:12:20.961
And one of the ways we can come across as an expert
就是发掘我们的热情。

259
00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:23.083
is by tapping into our passion.
我希望每个人都能在未来的 几天当中，去见各自的朋友

260
00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:27.778
I want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs
和他们说，

261
00:12:27.802 --> 00:12:29.047
and just say to them,
“我希望你能够和我分享 一件你抱有热情的事。“

262
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:31.781
"I want you to describe a passion of yours to me."
我在世界各地让人们做这件事，

263
00:12:32.558 --> 00:12:35.043
I've had people do this all over the world
然后我询问他们，

264
00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:36.323
and I asked them,
“当朋友们向你们描述他们的热情时

265
00:12:36.347 --> 00:12:38.516
"What did you notice about the other person
你注意到了什么？“

266
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.594
when they described their passion?"
答案永远是相同的。

267
00:12:40.618 --> 00:12:42.518
And the answers are always the same.
“他们的眼睛变大了，变亮了。”

268
00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:44.550
"Their eyes lit up and got big."
“他们笑的很灿烂。”

269
00:12:44.574 --> 00:12:47.523
"They smiled a big beaming smile."
“他们用手不断的比划着－

270
00:12:47.547 --> 00:12:49.191
"They used their hands all over --
我必须要躲闪，因为 他们的手都伸向了我。”

271
00:12:49.215 --> 00:12:51.697
I had to duck because their hands were coming at me."
“他们更快速的，用更高频的声调说话。”

272
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:53.932
"They talk quickly with a little higher pitch."
（笑声）

273
00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:54.930
(Laughter)
“他们倾向我，好像要跟 我讲什么秘密一样。”

274
00:12:54.954 --> 00:12:57.398
"They leaned in as if telling me a secret."
然后，我就和他们说，

275
00:12:57.422 --> 00:12:58.743
And then I said to them,
“你们听他们讲述的时候， 你是什么样的反应呢？”

276
00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:04.474
"What happened to you as you listened to their passion?"
他们说，“我的眼睛变亮了。

277
00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:04.474
They said, "My eyes lit up.
我笑了。

278
00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:05.768
I smiled.
我也倾向了他们。”

279
00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:07.165
I leaned in."
当我们发掘自己的热情时，

280
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:09.258
When we tap into our passion,
我们通过自己的眼睛， 给予了自己大声说的勇气，

281
00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:12.648
we give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up,
但是我们也得到了他人的准许。

282
00:13:12.672 --> 00:13:15.540
but we also get the permission from others to speak up.
