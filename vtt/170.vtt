In the movie "Interstellar,"
在电影《星际穿越》中，

2
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.421
we get an up-close look at a supermassive black hole.

3
00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:20.634
Set against a backdrop of bright gas,

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:22.776
the black hole's massive gravitational pull
黑洞的巨大引力

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.235
bends light into a ring.
将光线弯曲成环形。

6
00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.368
However, this isn't a real photograph,
但是，（电影中的）这一幕 并不是一张真正的照片，

7
00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.178
but a computer graphic rendering --
而是电脑合成的效果——

8
00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:31.592
an artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like.
它只是一个对于黑洞 可能样子的艺术表现。

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.387
A hundred years ago,

12
00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.472
scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it.
科学家们又对此提供了许多佐证。

13
00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:44.580
But one thing predicted from this theory, black holes,

14
00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:46.954
still have not been directly observed.

15
00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:50.184
Although we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like,
尽管我们大致知道一个黑洞 看起来应该是什么样，

16
00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:52.971
we've never actually taken a picture of one before.
却从未真正拍摄过它。

17
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:57.274
However, you might be surprised to know that that may soon change.
不过，这个现状可能很快就会改变。

18
00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:01.478
We may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years.
在接下来几年内，我们或许就能 见到第一张黑洞的图片。

19
00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:05.460
Getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists,

22
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.459
Although I won't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today,
尽管今天我不能让你们 见到真正的黑洞图片，

23
00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:16.394
I'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved

24
00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:18.031
in getting that first picture.
得到第一张（黑洞）图片 所需要的努力。

25
00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:20.734
My name is Katie Bouman,

26
00:01:20.758 --> 00:01:23.324
and I'm a PhD student at MIT.

29
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.883
But although I'm not an astronomer,

30
00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:32.192
today I'd like to show you
今天我还是想向大家展示

31
00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:35.083
how I've been able to contribute to this exciting project.
我是怎样在这个项目中贡献 自己的一份力量的。

32
00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:37.974
If you go out past the bright city lights tonight,
如果你远离城市的灯光，

33
00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:40.434
you may just be lucky enough to see a stunning view
你可能有幸看到银河系

34
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.951
of the Milky Way Galaxy.
那令人震撼的美景。

35
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.437
And if you could zoom past millions of stars,
而如果你可以穿过百万星辰， 将镜头放大到

36
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:48.216
26,000 light-years toward the heart of the spiraling Milky Way,
2.6万光年以外的银河系中心，

37
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.761
we'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center.

38
00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.991
Peering past all the galactic dust with infrared telescopes,
天文学家们已经穿过星尘，使用红外望远镜

39
00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:58.866
astronomers have watched these stars for over 16 years.
观察了这些恒星整整十六年。

40
00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.495
But it's what they don't see that is the most spectacular.
但是天文学家们所看不到的东西 才是最为壮观的。

41
00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.585
These stars seem to orbit an invisible object.

42
00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.932
By tracking the paths of these stars,

43
00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.250
astronomers have concluded

that the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion
体积足够小，而质量又大到能导致 恒星们如此运动的唯一物体

45
00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:14.395
is a supermassive black hole --
就是超级黑洞——

46
00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:18.597
an object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close --
它的密度极大，高到它能吸进 周围所有东西，

47
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.115
even light.
甚至光。

48
00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.200
But what happens if we were to zoom in even further?
那么，如果我们继续放大下去， 会发生什么？

49
00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:27.957
Is it possible to see something that, by definition, is impossible to see?
是不是就可能看见一些， 理论上不可能看到的东西呢？

50
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.783
Well, it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths,
事实上，如果我们以 无线电波长放大，

51
00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:33.489
we'd expect to see a ring of light
我们会看到一圈光线，

52
00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:35.924
caused by the gravitational lensing of hot plasma
是由围绕着黑洞的

53
00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:37.777
zipping around the black hole.
等离子体引力透镜产生的。

54
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.961
In other words,
换句话说，

55
00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:42.156
the black hole casts a shadow on this backdrop of bright material,
这个黑洞，在背后明亮物质的衬托下，

56
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.006
carving out a sphere of darkness.
留下一个圆形的暗影。

57
00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:47.385
This bright ring reveals the black hole's event horizon,
而它周围那明亮的光环 指示了黑洞边境的位置。

58
00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.809
where the gravitational pull becomes so great
在这里，引力作用变得无比巨大，

59
00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.459
that not even light can escape.
大到就连光线都无法逃离。

60
00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:54.342
Einstein's equations predict the size and shape of this ring,
爱因斯坦用公式推测了 这个环的大小和形状，

61
00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:57.574
so taking a picture of it wouldn't only be really cool,
所以，给光环拍照不仅很酷，

62
00:02:57.598 --> 00:03:00.216
it would also help to verify that these equations hold
还能帮助我们检验这些公式在

63
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.706
in the extreme conditions around the black hole.
黑洞周围的极端环境下是否成立。

64
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.288
However, this black hole is so far away from us,
不过，这个黑洞离我们太过遥远，

65
00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:08.410
that from Earth, this ring appears incredibly small --
从地球上看，它非常，非常小——

66
00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:12.024
the same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon.
大概就和月球上的一个橘子一样大。

67
00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:15.402
That makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult.
这导致给它拍照变得无比艰难。

68
00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.767
Why is that?
为什么呢？

69
00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:21.520
Well, it all comes down to a simple equation.
一切都源于一个简单的等式。

70
00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.960
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,
由于衍射现象，

71
00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:25.339
there are fundamental limits
我们所能看到的

72
00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:28.033
to the smallest objects that we can possibly see.
最小物体是有限制的。

73
00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.281
This governing equation says that in order to see smaller and smaller,
这个等式指出，当想要看到的 东西越来越小时，

74
00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:34.892
we need to make our telescope bigger and bigger.
望远镜需要变得更大。

75
00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:37.985
But even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on Earth,
但即使是地球上功能最强大的 光学望远镜，

76
00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.412
we can't even get close to the resolution necessary
其分辨率甚至不足以

77
00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:42.650
to image on the surface of the moon.
让我们得到月球表面的图片。

78
00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:46.291
In fact, here I show one of the highest resolution images ever taken
事实上，这里是一张有史以来 从地球上拍摄的最高清的

79
00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:47.712
of the moon from Earth.
月球图片。

80
00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:50.293
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,
它包含约1.3万个像素，

81
00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:54.367
and yet each pixel would contain over 1.5 million oranges.
而每一个像素里包含超过150万个橘子。

82
00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:57.188
So how big of a telescope do we need
所以，我们需要多大的望远镜

83
00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:59.977
in order to see an orange on the surface of the moon
才能看到月球表面的橘子，

84
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.215
and, by extension, our black hole?
以及，那个黑洞呢？

85
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.579
Well, it turns out that by crunching the numbers,
事实上，通过计算，

86
00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:06.537
you can easily calculate that we would need a telescope
我们可以轻易得出所需的 望远镜的大小，

87
00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:07.984
the size of the entire Earth.
就和整个地球一样大。

88
00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:08.882
(Laughter)
（笑声）

89
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.065
If we could build this Earth-sized telescope,
而如果我们能够建造出这个 地球大小的望远镜，

90
00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:14.770
we could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light
就能够分辨出那指示着视界线的

91
00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:16.331
indicative of the black hole's event horizon.
独特的光环。

92
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.273
Although this picture wouldn't contain all the detail we see
尽管在这张照片上，我们无法看到

93
00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:21.449
in computer graphic renderings,
电脑合成图上的那些细节，

94
00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:23.406
it would allow us to safely get our first glimpse
它仍可以让我们对于

95
00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.283
of the immediate environment around a black hole.
黑洞周围的环境有个大致的了解。

96
00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.920
However, as you can imagine,
但是，正如你预料，

97
00:04:27.944 --> 00:04:31.568
building a single-dish telescope the size of the Earth is impossible.
想建造一个地球大小的射电望远镜 是不可能的。

98
00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:33.479
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,
不过，米克·贾格尔有一句名言：

99
00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:35.294
"You can't always get what you want,
“你不可能永远心想事成，

100
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:37.505
but if you try sometimes, you just might find
但如果你尝试了，说不定就 正好能找到

101
00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:38.744
you get what you need."
你所需要的东西。”

102
00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:41.232
And by connecting telescopes from around the world,
通过将遍布全世界的望远镜 连接起来，

103
00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:44.794
an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope
“视界线望远镜”， 一个国际合作项目，诞生了。

104
00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:47.927
is creating a computational telescope the size of the Earth,
这个项目通过电脑制作一个 地球大小的望远镜，

105
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:49.488
capable of resolving structure
能够帮助我们找到

106
00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:51.711
on the scale of a black hole's event horizon.
黑洞视界线的结构。

107
00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:55.122
This network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture
这个由无数小望远镜构成的网络 将会在明年拍下它的

108
00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.961
of a black hole next year.
第一张黑洞图片。

109
00:04:56.985 --> 00:05:00.323
Each telescope in the worldwide network works together.
在这个网络中，每一个望远镜 都与其他所有望远镜一同工作。

110
00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:03.059
Linked through the precise timing of atomic clocks,
通过原子钟的准确时间相连，

111
00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:05.740
teams of researchers at each of the sites freeze light
各地的研究团队们通过收集

112
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.726
by collecting thousands of terabytes of data.
上万千兆字节的数据来定位光线。

113
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.767
This data is then processed in a lab right here in Massachusetts.
接下来，这份数据会在 麻省的实验室进行处理。

114
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.585
So how does this even work?
那么，这一项目到底是 怎么运作的呢？

115
00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:19.012
Remember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy,
大家是否记得，如果要看到 银河系中心的那个黑洞，

116
00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:21.642
we need to build this impossibly large Earth-sized telescope?
我们需要一个地球大小的望远镜？

117
00:05:21.642 --> 00:05:24.258
For just a second, let's pretend we could build
现在，先假设我们可以

118
00:05:24.298 --> 00:05:26.140
a telescope the size of the Earth.
将这个望远镜建造出来。

119
00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:28.619
This would be a little bit like turning the Earth
这可能有点像是把地球变成

120
00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:30.354
into a giant spinning disco ball.
一个巨大的球形迪斯科灯。

121
00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:32.614
Each individual mirror would collect light
每一面镜子都会收集光线，

122
00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:35.235
that we could then combine together to make a picture.
然后，我们就可以将这些光线 组合成图片。

123
00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.920
However, now let's say we remove most of those mirrors
但是，现在，假设我们将 大多数镜子移走，

124
00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:39.916
so only a few remained.
只有几片留了下来。

125
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.817
We could still try to combine this information together,
我们仍可以尝试将信息合成图片，

126
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.834
but now there are a lot of holes.
但现在，图片中有很多洞。

127
00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:49.231
These remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes.
这几片留下来的镜子就代表了 地球上的几处天文望远镜。

128
00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:53.334
This is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from.
这对于制成一张图片来说， 还远远不够。

129
00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:57.196
But although we only collect light at a few telescope locations,
不过，尽管我们只在寥寥几处 地方收集光线，

130
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.643
as the Earth rotates, we get to see other new measurements.
每当地球旋转时，我们便可以 得到新的信息。

131
00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:04.486
In other words, as the disco ball spins, those mirrors change locations
换言之，当迪斯科球旋转时， 镜子会改变位置，

132
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.409
and we get to observe different parts of the image.
而我们就可以看到图片的各个部分。

133
00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:11.451
The imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball
我们开发的生成图片的算法 可以将迪斯科球上的空缺部分填满，

134
00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:14.508
in order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image.
从而建造出隐藏的黑洞图片。

135
00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:17.168
If we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe --
如果我们能在地球上每一处 都装上望远镜，

136
00:06:16.902 --> 00:06:18.907
in other words, the entire disco ball --
或者说能有整个迪斯科球，

137
00:06:18.907 --> 00:06:20.425
this would be trivial.
那么这个算法并不算重要。

138
00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:23.787
However, we only see a few samples, and for that reason,
但现在我们只有少量的样本，

139
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.199
there are an infinite number of possible images
所以，可能有无数张图像

140
00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:29.187
that are perfectly consistent with our telescope measurements.
符合望远镜所测量到的信息。

141
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.227
However, not all images are created equal.
但并不是每一张图片都一样。

142
00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.127
Some of those images look more like what we think of as images than others.
有些图片，比其他一些 看起来更像我们想象中的图片。

143
00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.373
And so, my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole
所以我在拍摄黑洞 这一项目中的任务是，

144
00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:43.329
is to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image
开发一种既可以找到最合理图像，

145
00:06:43.353 --> 00:06:45.575
that also fits the telescope measurements.
又能使图像符合望远镜 所测量到的信息的算法。

146
00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:50.489
Just as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions
就像法医素描师通过有限的信息，

147
00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:54.027
to piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure,
结合自己对于人脸结构的认知 画出一张画像一样，

148
00:06:53.893 --> 00:06:57.350
the imaging algorithms I develop use our limited telescope data
我正在开发的图片算法， 是使用望远镜提供的有限数据

149
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.712
to guide us to a picture that also looks like stuff in our universe.
来生成一张看起来像是 宇宙里的东西的图片。

150
00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:05.387
Using these algorithms, we're able to piece together pictures
通过这些算法，我们能从散乱 而充满干扰的数据中

151
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:07.591
from this sparse, noisy data.
合成一张图片。

152
00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:12.144
So here I show a sample reconstruction done using simulated data,
这里是一个用模拟数据 进行重现的例子：

153
00:07:12.168 --> 00:07:14.101
when we pretend to point our telescopes
我们假设将望远镜指向

154
00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:16.674
to the black hole in the center of our galaxy.
银河系中心的黑洞。

155
00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:21.189
Although this is just a simulation, reconstruction such as this give us hope
尽管这只是一个模拟，像这样的 重建工作给了我们

156
00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:24.666
that we'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole
真正给黑洞拍摄可行照片的希望，

157
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.285
and from it, determine the size of its ring.
之后便可以决定其光环的大小。

158
00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:31.137
Although I'd love to go on about all the details of this algorithm,
虽然我很想继续描绘 这个算法的细节，

159
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.335
luckily for you, I don't have the time.
但你们很幸运，我没有这个时间。

160
00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:35.360
But I'd still like to give you a brief idea
可我仍然想大概让你们了解一下

161
00:07:35.384 --> 00:07:37.686
of how we define what our universe looks like,
我们是怎样定义宇宙的样子，

162
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.176
and how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results.
以及是怎样以此来重建 和校验我们的结果的。

163
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.696
Since there are an infinite number of possible images
由于有无数种可以完美解释

164
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.085
that perfectly explain our telescope measurements,
望远镜测量结果的图片，

165
00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:49.714
we have to choose between them in some way.
我们需要找到一个方式进行挑选。

166
00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:51.576
We do this by ranking the images
我们会按照这些图片是

167
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.434
based upon how likely they are to be the black hole image,
真正黑洞图片的可能性进行排序，

168
00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:56.940
and then choosing the one that's most likely.
然后选出可能性最高的那一张。

169
00:07:56.964 --> 00:07:59.159
So what do I mean by this exactly?
我这话到底是什么意思呢？

170
00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:01.660
Let's say we were trying to make a model
假设我们正在建立一个能够

171
00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:04.867
that told us how likely an image were to appear on Facebook.
指出一张图出现在脸书上的 可能性的模型。

172
00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:06.592
We'd probably want the model to say
我们希望这个模型能指出

173
00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:10.173
it's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left,
不太可能有人会上传最左边的图像，

174
00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:12.277
and pretty likely that someone would post a selfie
而像右边那样的自拍照

175
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.974
like this one on the right.
画出一张图片一样，

176
00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:15.637
The image in the middle is blurry,
中间那张图有点模糊，

177
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.300
so even though it's more likely we'd see it on Facebook
所以它被发表的可能性

178
00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:19.178
compared to the noise image,
比左边的噪点图像大，

179
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.668
it's probably less likely we'd see it compared to the selfie.
但比右边自拍发表的可能性要小。

180
00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:24.982
But when it comes to images from the black hole,
但是当模型的主角变成 黑洞的照片时，

181
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:28.492
we're posed with a real conundrum: we've never seen a black hole before.
一个难题出现了：我们从未 见过真正的黑洞。

182
00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:30.823
In that case, what is a likely black hole image,
在这样的情况下， 什么样的图才更像黑洞，

183
00:08:30.847 --> 00:08:33.785
and what should we assume about the structure of black holes?
而我们又该怎样假设黑洞的结构呢？

184
00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.441
We could try to use images from simulations we've done,
我们或许能够使用模拟试验 得出的图片，

185
00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.995
like the image of the black hole from "Interstellar,"
比如《星际穿越》里的那张黑洞图。

186
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:41.921
but if we did this, it could cause some serious problems.
但这样做可能会引起 一些严重的问题。

187
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:45.361
What would happen if Einstein's theories didn't hold?
如果爱因斯坦的理论是错的怎么办？

188
00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:49.346
We'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on.
我们仍然想要得到一张 准确而真实的图片。

189
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.741
If we bake Einstein's equations too much into our algorithms,
而如果我们在算法中掺入太多 爱因斯坦的公式，

190
00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.520
we'll just end up seeing what we expect to see.
最终只会看到我们所希望看到的。

191
00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:57.820
In other words, we want to leave the option open
换句话说，我们想保留在银河系中心

192
00:08:57.844 --> 00:09:00.767
for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy.
看到一头大象这样的可能性。

193
00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:01.848
(Laughter)
（笑声）

194
00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:04.861
Different types of images have very distinct features.
不同类型的照片拥有 完全不同的特征。

195
00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:08.433
We can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images
我们可以轻松分辨出 一张黑洞模拟图

196
00:09:08.457 --> 00:09:10.733
and images we take every day here on Earth.
和我们日常拍的照片的差别。

197
00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:13.861
We need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like
我们需要在不过度提供某类图片 特征的情况下，

198
00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:17.134
without imposing one type of image's features too much.
告诉我们的算法，一张正常的图片 应该是什么样。

199
00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:19.578
One way we can try to get around this
做到这一点的一种方法是，

200
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:22.664
is by imposing the features of different kinds of images
向算法展示拥有不同特征的图片，

201
00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:26.818
and seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions.
然后看看这些图片会怎样 影响重建的结果。

202
00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:31.023
If all images' types produce a very similar-looking image,
如果不同类型的图片都产生出了 差不多的图像，

203
00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:33.104
then we can start to become more confident
那么我们便可以更有信心了，

204
00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:37.285
that the image assumptions we're making are not biasing this picture that much.
我们对图片的假设并没有 导致结果出现太大偏差。

205
00:09:37.325 --> 00:09:40.315
This is a little bit like giving the same description
这就有点像让来自不同国家的 三个法医素描师

206
00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:43.335
to three different sketch artists from all around the world.
根据同样的文字描述来作画。

207
00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:46.219
If they all produce a very similar-looking face,
如果他们画出的脸都差不多，

208
00:09:46.243 --> 00:09:48.036
then we can start to become confident
那么我们就能比较确信，

209
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.660
that they're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings.
他们各自的文化背景 并没有影响到他们的画。

210
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.015
One way we can try to impose different image features
将不同图片的特征赋予 （算法）的一个方法

211
00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:57.320
is by using pieces of existing images.
就是使用现有的图片的碎片特征。

212
00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.194
So we take a large collection of images,
所以，我们将大量的图像

213
00:10:00.218 --> 00:10:02.936
and we break them down into their little image patches.
分解成无数小图片，

214
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.245
We then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.
然后像拼图一样处理这些小图片。

215
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:11.547
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image
我们用其中常见的拼图碎片 来组合成一张

216
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:14.023
that also fits our telescope measurements.
符合望远镜所测量数据的完整图片。

217
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.603
Different types of images have very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.
不同类型的图片拥有 完全不同的拼图碎片。

218
00:10:18.627 --> 00:10:21.433
So what happens when we take the same data
所以，当我们使用相同的数据和

219
00:10:21.457 --> 00:10:25.587
but we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image?
截然不同的拼图类型来 重现图像时，会发生什么呢？

220
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:30.377
Let's first start with black hole image simulation puzzle pieces.
我们先从黑洞模拟类的拼图开始。

221
00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:31.992
OK, this looks reasonable.
这张图看起来还比较合理。

222
00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:34.694
This looks like what we expect a black hole to look like.
它比较符合我们预料中黑洞的样子。

223
00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:35.927
But did we just get it
但我们得到这个结果

224
00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:39.265
because we just fed it little pieces of black hole simulation images?
是否仅仅是因为我们拿的是 黑洞模拟拼图呢？

225
00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:41.169
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces
我们再来试试另一组拼图，

226
00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:43.702
from astronomical, non-black hole objects.
这组拼图由宇宙中不是黑洞的 各种天体构成。

227
00:10:44.734 --> 00:10:46.860
OK, we get a similar-looking image.
很好，我们得到了一幅相似的图片。

228
00:10:46.884 --> 00:10:49.120
And then how about pieces from everyday images,
那如果我们拿日常照片的拼图 会怎么样呢，

229
00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:51.929
like the images you take with your own personal camera?
就像你每天拿自己的相机 拍的那种照片？

230
00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:55.247
Great, we see the same image.
太好了，我们看到了和之前 一样的图像。

231
00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:58.637
When we get the same image from all different sets of puzzle pieces,
当我们通过不同类型的拼图 得出一样的图片时，

232
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:00.707
then we can start to become more confident
我们就有充足的自信说

233
00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:02.697
that the image assumptions we're making
我们对图片进行的推测，

234
00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:05.642
aren't biasing the final image we get too much.
并没有引起最终结果的太大偏差。

235
00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.919
Another thing we can do is take the same set of puzzle pieces,
我们能做的另一件事是， 用同一组拼图，

236
00:11:08.943 --> 00:11:11.432
such as the ones derived from everyday images,
比如源自日常图片的那一种，

237
00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:15.056
and use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images.
来得到不同类型的源图片。

238
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.351
So in our simulations,
所以，在我们的模拟试验中，

239
00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.150
we pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non-black hole objects,
我们假设黑洞看起来像一个 非黑洞天体，

240
00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:24.023
as well as everyday images like the elephant in the center of our galaxy.
以及在银河系中心的一头大象。

241
00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:27.199
When the results of our algorithms on the bottom look very similar
当下面一排算法算出的图片

242
00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:29.335
to the simulation's truth image on top,
看起来和上面一排实际图片 十分相似时，

243
00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:32.705
then we can start to become more confident in our algorithms.
我们就能对我们的算法 有更多信心了。

244
00:11:32.729 --> 00:11:34.596
And I really want to emphasize here
在这里我想强调，

245
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.554
that all of these pictures were created
此处所有的图片都是由

246
00:11:36.578 --> 00:11:39.514
by piecing together little pieces of everyday photographs,
拼接日常照片而得出的，

247
00:11:39.538 --> 00:11:41.753
like you'd take with your own personal camera.
就像你自己用相机拍的照片一样。

248
00:11:41.777 --> 00:11:45.053
So an image of a black hole we've never seen before
所以，一张我们从未见过的 黑洞的照片，

249
00:11:45.077 --> 00:11:49.020
may eventually be created by piecing together pictures we see all the time
最终却可能由我们日常 熟悉的图片构成：

250
00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:51.789
of people, buildings, trees, cats and dogs.
人，楼房，树，小猫，小狗……

251
00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:54.458
Imaging ideas like this will make it possible for us
想象这样的想法使拍摄第一张

252
00:11:54.482 --> 00:11:57.101
to take our very first pictures of a black hole,
黑洞的图片成为可能，

253
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.572
and hopefully, verify those famous theories
同时使我们有望校验

254
00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:02.017
on which scientists rely on a daily basis.
科学家们每天所依靠的著名理论。

255
00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:04.649
But of course, getting imaging ideas like this working
但是，要想让如此充满想象力的 点子实际工作，

256
00:12:04.673 --> 00:12:07.995
would never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers
离不开这些我有幸一同工作的

257
00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:09.890
that I have the privilege to work with.
出色的研究者团队。

258
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.093
It still amazes me
我仍然对此感到振奋：

259
00:12:11.117 --> 00:12:14.468
that although I began this project with no background in astrophysics,
虽然在项目开始时我没有任何 天文学背景知识，

260
00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:17.111
what we have achieved through this unique collaboration
我们通过这一独特合作 所达成的成就，

261
00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:19.878
could result in the very first images of a black hole.
可能导致世界上第一幅 黑洞照片的诞生。

262
00:12:19.918 --> 00:12:22.616
But big projects like the Event Horizon Telescope
像视界线望远镜这样大项目的成功

263
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.454
are successful due to all the interdisciplinary expertise
是由来自不同学科的人们 用他们各自的专业知识，

264
00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.268
different people bring to the table.
一起创造的结果。

265
00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:28.998
We're a melting pot of astronomers,
我们是一个由天文学家，物理学家，

266
00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:31.254
physicists, mathematicians and engineers.
数学家和工程学家构成的大熔炉。

267
00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:33.832
This is what will make it soon possible
这就是我们能够很快达成

268
00:12:33.856 --> 00:12:36.709
to achieve something once thought impossible.
一个看起来不可能达成的 成就的原因。

269
00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:38.989
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out
在此我想鼓励你们所有人，走出去，

270
00:12:38.953 --> 00:12:41.093
and help push the boundaries of science,
推动科学的边际，

271
00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:45.034
even if it may at first seem as mysterious to you as a black hole.
尽管刚开始它看起来可能 和一个黑洞一样神秘。

272
00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:46.232
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

273
00:12:46.256 --> 00:12:48.653
(Applause)
