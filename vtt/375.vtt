and I thought everybody could see them.

32

“易克鲁，过来看看这些大理石的设计，看看这些纹路，看看这些图案。”

33
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.636
And he would tell me, "Laolu, I don't see anything."
他告诉我， “劳鲁，我没看到任何东西。”

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.756
So I would use ink, and I would trace out what I saw on the floor.
所以我会用墨水，在地上描出我看到的东西。

35
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.356
And then when my mom noticed, she got really upset.

38
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.916
I switched from ink to chalk,
我用粉笔替代了墨水，

39
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.916
because I got in trouble a lot with my teachers and my parents.

Why don't you draw like other people?

43
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.260
or maybe even draw Jesus?"

44
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.956
You know, I could paint the whole house if I had a chance,
如果我有机会，我会在整栋房子画上画，

45
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.916
but when I grew up, I knew being an artist was not an option,
但是当我长大了，我意识到成为一名艺术家并不是个选择

46
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.916
so I wanted to be the person my parents wanted me to be,

47
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.516
so I went to law school.

Of course I would miss classes,

and I would make up excuses why I wasn't going to class.

53
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.036
But when I started working at the Human Rights Commission as a human rights attorney,

54
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.260

I was so frustrated seeing all the injustice around me,

the fact that our future is controlled by where we are born.

With my art, I like to tell stories.

You see, with my art,

"Oh, [it's just a phase.] He'll come back."

85
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.916
But life as an artist in New York was not easy,

86
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.956
because I was broke,

87
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.916
no money, no gallery agents, no representation,

so no gallery would show my work.

So I thought to myself, I need to survive.

And then soon I realized the power,

because people were so proud to wear their stories.

and I saw this picture.

and that's how I started painting on human bodies.

As a child I saw art on the marble floors,

I remember my grandmother,

111
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.636

and the art on my grandmother's skin.

114
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.356
Now I look at all the people I painted, and I think to myself, like,
现在我看着我作画的人，我想着，

115
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.796
what would it look like if we all walked around like gods and goddesses from Yoruba mythology?
要是我们都像约鲁巴神话中的天神和天女一样游走会怎么样？

And boom, that's how The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.
嘣，这就是《奥日神圣艺术》的诞生。

117

You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology

means your soul, it means your essence, it means your instincts.

120
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.276
then you can actually move mountains.
你才真正拥有洪荒之力。

121
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.060
So there's something so immediate about painting on human bodies.
在人体上作画是很直接的。

122
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.276
It's like art in motion.

123
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.356
It's like a 3D experience.

I was like, what, how did she even know me?

133
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.156
I thought this can't be true. Of course I thought it was a scam.

137
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.676
But incredibly enough, it was real, it was true,
但是令人难以置信的是，这是真的，真的是真的，

138
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.276
and things happened really fast.
一切来得那么突然。

139
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.796
You see, Beyoncé wanted to pay homage to New Orleans,
碧昂丝想要对新奥尔良（枪击事件）表达她的想法，

140
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.076
