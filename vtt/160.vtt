00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:14.410
How much do you get paid?
你的工资是多少？

2
00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:16.863
Don't answer that out loud.
先别说出来。

3
00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:19.267
But put a number in your head.
在脑子里想一下。

4
00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:24.480
Now: How much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid?
现在想想： 你觉得邻座的工资是多少？

5
00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.155
Again, don't answer out loud.
也别说出来。

6
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.281
(Laughter)
（笑声）

7
00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:31.322
At work, how much do you think
你觉得办公室里

8
00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:35.284
the person sitting in the cubicle or the desk next to you gets paid?

9
00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:36.463
Do you know?
你知道吗？

10
00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:38.162
Should you know?
你应该知道吗？

11
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.758
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions.
问这些问题连我都觉得不太自在，

12
00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:45.932
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.
但是承认吧—— 你有点想知道答案。

13
00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.338
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary.
我们大多数人都不想 告诉别人自己的工资，

14
00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.511
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,
我们不想把工资告诉邻居，

15
00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:55.727
and we're definitely not supposed to tell our office neighbors.
也绝对不想告诉办公室的同事。

16
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:59.265
The assumed reason is that if everybody knew what everybody got paid,
可能如果大家都知道别人的工资，

17
00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.079
then all hell would break loose.
就要天下大乱了。

18
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.204
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,
可能会出现争吵，打架，

19
00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.401
there might even be a few people who quit.
甚至会有人辞职。

20
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.220
But what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife?
但如果这个秘密恰恰 就是冲突的起因呢？

21
00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:11.862
And what would happen if we removed that secrecy?
如果我们揭开这个秘密会发生什么呢？

22
00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.410
What if openness actually increased the sense of fairness and collaboration
公开薪资能不能增进公司内部的合作，

23
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:17.736
inside a company?
还有公平感呢？

24
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.266
What would happen if we had total pay transparency?
如果完全公开薪资信息，那会发生什么呢？

25
00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:23.391
For the past several years,
过去的几年里，

26
00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.328
I've been studying the corporate and entrepreneurial leaders
我一直在研究那些质疑 传统经营理念的

27
00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.901
who question the conventional wisdom about how to run a company.
企业家和创业者。

28
00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:32.377

29
00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.375
And the answers keep surprising.
答案也在不断挑战传统观念。

30
00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:38.085
It turns out that pay transparency --
结果表明，薪资透明 —

31
00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.219
sharing salaries openly across a company --
在整个公司中公开薪资数据 —

32
00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:42.892
makes for a better workplace for both the employee
会为雇员和雇主

33
00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.503
and for the organization.
营造更好的工作环境。

34
00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:48.281
When people don't know how their pay compares to their peers',

35
00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.121
they're more likely to feel underpaid

36
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.080
and maybe even discriminated against.
甚至受到了歧视。

37
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.041
Do you want to work at a place that tolerates the idea

38
00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:57.869
that you feel underpaid or discriminated against?
或者遭到歧视的地方工作吗？

39
00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:01.027
But keeping salaries secret does exactly that,
对薪资保密恰恰会导致这样的结果，

40
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:03.934
and it's a practice as old as it is common,
却被长期且普遍的接受，

41
00:02:04.494 --> 00:02:06.586
despite the fact that in the United States,
尽管美国法律

42
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.060
the law protects an employee's right to discuss their pay.
保护雇员讨论薪资的权利。

43
00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:13.795
In one famous example from decades ago,
几十年前，有一个著名的例子，

44
00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.925
the management of Vanity Fair magazine
《名利场》杂志的管理层

45
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.069
actually circulated a memo entitled:

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:21.298
"Forbidding Discussion Among Employees of Salary Received."

47
00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:24.644
"Forbidding" discussion among employees of salary received.

48
00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:27.449
Now that memo didn't sit well with everybody.
不是所有人都 接受得了这条规则，

49
00:02:27.473 --> 00:02:29.519
New York literary figures Dorothy Parker,
纽约文坛人物多乐西·帕克，

50
00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:31.305
Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,
罗伯特·本克利 和罗伯特·舍伍德，

51
00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.770
all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,
三位阿冈昆圆桌会议的作家，

52
00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:35.575
decided to stand up for transparency

53
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.331
and showed up for work the next day

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.569
with their salary written on signs hanging from their neck.
他们脖子上挂了个牌子， 上面写了自己的工资。

55
00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.141
(Laughter)
（笑声）

56
00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.111
Imagine showing up for work

57
00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:47.625
with your salary just written across your chest for all to see.
胸前挂着工资牌，谁都能看到。

58
00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:52.663
But why would a company even want to discourage salary discussions?

59
00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:56.019
Why do some people go along with it, while others revolt against it?
为什么一些人服从， 而另一些人反对呢？

60
00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:00.770
It turns out that in addition to the assumed reasons,
除了之前猜测的理由之外，

61
00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:04.097
pay secrecy is actually a way to save a lot of money.
对薪资保密还是省钱的良方。

62
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.032
You see, keeping salaries secret
想想看，工资不透明会导致

63
00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:09.007
leads to what economists call "information asymmetry."
经济学家所说的“信息不对称”。

64
00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:11.256
This is a situation where, in a negotiation,
在这种情况下谈判的双方，

65
00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:14.324
one party has loads more information than the other.
一方比另一方掌握更多的信息。

66
00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:18.117
And in hiring or promotion or annual raise discussions,

67
00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:21.799
an employer can use that secrecy to save a lot of money.

68
00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:24.962
Imagine how much better you could negotiate for a raise
想象一下，知道每个人的工资，

69
00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:26.793
if you knew everybody's salary.
对你的加薪谈判多么有利。

70
00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:31.873
Economists warn that information asymmetry

71
00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:33.544
can cause markets to go awry.
会导致市场偏离正轨。

72
00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.474
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,
如果有人在复印时 不小心遗留了一张工资表，

73
00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:37.916
and suddenly everybody is shouting at each other.
很快大家就会彼此争论起来。

74
00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.392
In fact, they even warn
事实上，经济学家甚至还提醒，

75
00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:45.233
that information asymmetry can lead to a total market failure.
信息不对称可能导致市场失调。

76
00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.929
And I think we're almost there.
我认为我们正处在这个边缘，

77
00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:49.119
Here's why:
原因就在于：

78
00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:54.071
first, most employees have no idea how their pay compares to their peers'.
首先，大部分雇员不清楚 自己与同事的工资存在多少差异。

79
00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:58.504
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,
在2015年进行的一项 覆盖7万名雇员的调查中，

80
00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:01.909
two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate
三分之二的调查者 认为他们被压低了薪水，

81
00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:04.165
said that they felt they were underpaid.
虽然他们拿到的都是基于市场 正常水平支付的工资。

82
00:04:04.856 --> 00:04:07.735
And of everybody who felt that they were underpaid,
这些认为被压低工资的人，

83
00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.712
60 percent said that they intended to quit,
有60%说他们想要辞职，

84
00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:13.624
regardless of where they were -- underpaid, overpaid
不管他们的实际工资 是过低还是过高，

85
00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:15.227
or right at the market rate.
还是恰好在正常水平。

86
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.480
If you were part of this survey, what would you say?
如果你参与这个调查， 你会怎么说？

87
00:04:18.504 --> 00:04:19.780
Are you underpaid?
你被压低工资了吗？

88
00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:22.129
Well, wait -- how do you even know,
等一下，既然都 不允许谈论工资，

89
00:04:22.153 --> 00:04:24.286
because you're not allowed to talk about it?
你又怎么知道是被压低了？

90
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:28.330
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,
其次，信息不对称， 薪资保密，

91
00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:31.133
makes it easier to ignore the discrimination
会让市场中现实存在的歧视

92
00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:33.624
that's already present in the market today.
更容易被忽视。

93
00:04:34.037 --> 00:04:37.734
In a 2011 report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research,
妇女政策研究协会在 2011年发布的一份报告显示，

94
00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:39.882
the gender wage gap between men and women
男性和女性的工资差距

95
00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:41.644
was 23 percent.
高达23%。

96
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:44.890
This is where that 77 cents on the dollar comes from.
这就是“1美元中的77美分” （职场女性的薪酬是男性同事的77%）的来历。

97
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.924
But in the Federal Government,
但在联邦政府部门，

98
00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.011
where salaries are pinned to certain levels
薪资是有固定标准的，

99
00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.439
and everybody knows what those levels are,
每个雇员都清楚这个标准，

100
00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.148
the gender wage gap shrinks to 11 percent --
那里的性别薪资 差距就只有11% —

101
00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.784
and this is before controlling for any of the factors
这还是在实施经济学家呼吁的

102
00:04:55.808 --> 00:04:58.701
that economists argue over whether or not to control for.
控制措施之前的数据。

103
00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:01.756
If we really want to close the gender wage gap,
如果我们真的想 消除性别薪资差距，

104
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.268
maybe we should start by opening up the payroll.
可能需要从公开工资单开始。

105
00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:07.906
If this is what total market failure looks like,
如果市场失灵就是这个样子，

106
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.198
then openness remains the only way to ensure fairness.
那公开透明仍是 保证公平的唯一方法。

107
00:05:12.094 --> 00:05:14.595
Now, I realize that letting people know what you make
我知道公开收入，

108
00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.265
might feel uncomfortable,
可能让人不舒服，

109
00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.804
but isn't it less uncomfortable
但总是怀疑

110
00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:20.708
than always wondering if you're being discriminated against,
自己被歧视，

111
00:05:20.732 --> 00:05:24.494
or if your wife or your daughter or your sister is being paid unfairly?
或者家里的女性被不公平的 压低薪水不是更让人郁闷吗？

112
00:05:25.173 --> 00:05:29.113
Openness remains the best way to ensure fairness,
公开是保证公平的最好手段，

113
00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:31.050
and pay transparency does that.
薪资透明就是一种。

114
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.491
That's why entrepreneurial leaders and corporate leaders
这就是这些年 企业家和创业者们

115
00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:37.308
have been experimenting with sharing salaries for years.
尝试公开薪资的原因，

116
00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:38.745
Like Dane Atkinson.

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:42.648
Dane is a serial entrepreneur who started many companies

in a pay secrecy condition

119
00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:47.631
and even used that condition to pay two equally qualified people

120
00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:49.351
dramatically different salaries,
支付截然不同的薪水，

121
00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:51.544
depending on how well they could negotiate.
仅仅因为他们 谈薪水的能力不同。

122
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:55.242
And Dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this.
戴恩发现这导致了冲突。

123
00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:57.935
So when he started his newest company, SumAll,
所以当他创办新公司 SumAll 时，

124
00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:01.069
he committed to salary transparency from the beginning.

125
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.379
And the results have been amazing.
然而效果出乎意料的好。

126
00:06:04.244 --> 00:06:05.866
And in study after study,
在一个个的研究中，

127
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.766
when people know how they're being paid
当人们知道他们的收入

128
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.819
and how that pay compares to their peers',

00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:12.776
they're more likely to work hard to improve their performance,

130
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.649
more likely to be engaged, and they're less likely to quit.
更容易被动员，更不容易辞职。

131
00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:17.075
That's why Dane's not alone.
这就是为什么像戴恩 一样的人越来越多。

132
00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.270
From technology start-ups like Buffer,

133
00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:23.081
to the tens of thousands of employees at Whole Foods,

for all to see.

Now, pay transparency takes a lot of forms.

139
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:37.889
It's not one size fits all.

Some post their salaries for all to see.
