about what makes companies succeed the most,

what factors actually matter the most for startup success.

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.032
I believe that the startup organization

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:30.790
is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place.

and organize them in a startup,

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:40.429
you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible.

10
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.959
You get them to achieve unbelievable things.

11
00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.619
But if the startup organization is so great,
但是，如果创业组织那么伟大，

12
00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:47.101
why do so many fail?

13
00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:48.351
That's what I wanted to find out.

15
00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:54.602
And I wanted to try  to be systematic about it,
我也想要对此问题系统化的分析，

16
00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:56.912
avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have
避免一些因为我这些年看到许多公司

17
00:00:56.912 --> 00:00:59.705
from so many companies I've seen over the years.
而得来的直觉上的误解。

18
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:01.248
I wanted to know this
我想要知道这个，

19
00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:04.296
because I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old
因为，我从12岁上初中，在汽车站售卖糖果时，

20
00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:05.696
when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school,
便开始我自己的商业活动。

21
00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:09.401
to high school, when I made solar energy devices,
在高中时，我做太阳能设备的生意，

22
00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:11.049
to college, when I made loudspeakers.
在大学时，我做扩音器生意。

23
00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:13.479
And when I graduated from college, I started software companies.
当我从大学毕业的时候，我成立了一家软件公司。

24
00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.475
And 20 years ago, I started Idealab,
20年前，我成立了创意实验室，

25
00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:19.125
and in the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies,
在过去的20年里，我们成立超过100家公司。

26
00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:21.449
many successes, and many big failures.
其中，很多成功了，也有很多失败了。

27
00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:23.278
We learned a lot from those failures.
我们从那些失败中学到了很多。

28
00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:26.555
So I tried to look across what factors
所以，我尝试去探索

29
00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:29.545
accounted the most for company success and failure.
是什么因素导致公司的成败。

30
00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:31.278
So I looked at these five.
所以我关注在这5点。

31
00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:32.238
First, the idea.
第一，创意。

32
00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:34.394
I used to think that the idea was everything.
我过去认为，创意就是全部。

33
00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:35.624
I named my company Idealab for how much I worship
我将我的公司命名为创意实验室，

34
00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:38.691
the "aha!" moment when you first come up with the idea.
是因为，我十分推崇，当你首次想到某个想法的时候，“aha”（啊哈）开窍的时刻。

35
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:40.344
But then over time,
但是，随着时间的推移，

36
00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:43.790
I came to think that maybe the team, the execution, adaptability,
我认为或许团队、执行力或者是适应力，

37
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.941
that mattered even more than the idea.
比创意更要紧。

38
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:50.303
I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,
我从没想过，我会在TED的舞台上，引用拳王泰森的话，

39
00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:52.162
but he once said,
但是，他曾经说过，

40
00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:56.765
"Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face." (Laughter)
“每个人都有计划，直到被人打脸为止。”（笑声）

41
00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:58.775
And I think that's so true about business as well.
我认为，对于生意也是这样的。

42
00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:01.960
So much about a team's execution
对于一个团队的执行力为说，最要紧的，

43
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.720
is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.
是它使自己能适应被客户打脸的能力。

44
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.408
The customer is the true reality.
客户就是真理。

45
00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:08.859
And that's why I came to think
这就是为什么我认为

46
00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.376
that the team maybe was the most important thing.
团队是最重要的事情。

47
00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:13.968
Then I started looking at the business model.
然后，我开始关注商业模式。

48
00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:17.218
Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues?
就是这个公司是否有一条清晰的能产生客户收益的路线图吗？

49
00:02:16.948 --> 00:02:18.938
That started rising to the top in my thinking
商业模式开始成为我对什么对成功最重要

50
00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.642
about maybe what mattered most for success.
这一思考的重点。

51
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.036
Then I looked at the funding.
然后，我关注了资金。

52
00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:25.736
Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding.
有时候一些公司会去吸纳大量的资金，

53
00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.574
Maybe that's the most important thing?
也许这是最重要的事情？

54
00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:28.324
And then of course, the timing.
当然还有时机。

55
00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:31.450
Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it?
这个想法是不是太早了，我们还没有做好迎接它的准备？

56
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.377
Is it early, as in, you're in advance and you have to educate the world?
它是不是太超前了以至于你不得不来教导世界？

57
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.377
Is it just right?
它恰在时机吗？

58
00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.806
Or is it too late, and there's already too many competitors?
或者它是不是太晚，已经有太多的公司竞争？

59
00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:41.638
So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies.
所以我努力去认真考察这五个因素在公司中的影响。

60
00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:44.189
And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies,
我考察了100家创意实验室下的公司，

61
00:02:44.884 --> 00:02:46.338
and 100 non-Idealab companies
还有100家非创意实验室下的公司，

62
00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:48.974
to try and come up with  something scientific about it.
试图提出一些科学的东西。

63
00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.719
So first, on these Idealab companies,
首先，在这些创意实验公司里，

64
00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.592
the top five companies --
排在前面的五家公司

65
00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.552
Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com --
Citysearch ,CarsDirct, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com

66
00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:59.398
those all became billion-dollar successes.
最后都成为了十亿美元以上的成功公司

67
00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:00.995
And the five companies on the bottom --
而下面的五家公司

68
00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:03.805
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,Desktop Factory, Peoplelink

69
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:06.196
we all had high hopes for, but didn't succeed.
我们曾寄以重望，但没有成功。

70
00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:09.653
So I tried to rank across all  of those attributes
所以我试图就这些公司在每个因素中的得分，

71
00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:12.895
how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions.
给它们排序。

72
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:16.360
And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes,
然后对于非创意实验公司，我关注极度的成功者，

73
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.942
like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.
像Airbnb，Instagram, Uber ,YouTube ,Linkedln

74
00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:21.205
And some failures:
还有一些失败的案例

75
00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:22.285
Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com
Webvan,Kozmo,Pets.com

76
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.535
Flooz and Friendster.
Flooz 和 Friendster

77
00:03:24.285 --> 00:03:26.289
The bottom companies had intense funding,
垫底的公司都有雄厚的资金

78
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.368
they even had business models in some cases,
一些案例甚至有商业模式在里面

79
00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:29.515
but they didn't succeed.
但是，他们并没有成功。

80
00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:32.376
I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most
我尝试考察在这些成功和失败的案例中

81
00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:34.929
for success and failure across all of these companies,
到底什么因素真的最重要

82
00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:36.758
and the results really surprised me.
结果让我大吃一惊

83
00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.398
The number one thing was timing.
最重要的是时机

84
00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:44.460
Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure.
在解释成功和失败的差异中时机占42%

85
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.562
Team and execution came in second,
团队和执行力排在次位

86
00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:47.384
and the idea,
然后是创意

87
00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:50.301
the differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea,
创意的差异，或者说创意的独特性

88
00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:50.901
that actually came in third.
实际上排在第三位

89
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:53.154
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,
它不是决定性的

90
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.886
it's not to say that the idea isn't important,
不是说创意不重要

91
00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:59.526
but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing.
但创意不是最重要的，这还是让我惊讶

92
00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:01.416
Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed.
有时候更重要的是它是否恰对时机

93
00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:04.756
The last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually.
最末尾的两项，商业模式和资金，实际上对我意义深远

94
00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:07.321
I think business model makes sense to be that low
我认为商业模式之所以不那么重要

95
00:04:07.868 --> 00:04:10.248
because you can start out without a business model
是因为没有商业模式，你也可以创业

96
00:04:09.798 --> 00:04:11.948
and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating.
要是你的客户正需要你的创新时，更是如此

97
00:04:11.948 --> 00:04:13.715
And funding, I think as well,
至于资金，我认为也一样

98
00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:16.571
if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction,
如果你一开始资金不足然而却可以不断发展

99
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.896
especially in today's age,
实际上今天的时代

100
00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:19.965
it's very, very easy to get intense funding.
要想得到大量的资金真的非常非常的容易

101
00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:23.476
So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these.
那现在让我针对每个方面举一些具体的事例

102
00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:26.526
So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about.
就以家耳熟能详的Airbnb为例吧

103
00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:29.679
Well, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors
这家公司一开始曾被很多投资者pass掉了

104
00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:30.564
because people thought,
因为大家觉得

105
00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:33.366
"No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger."
“没人会腾出家里的一块地方出租给陌生人”

106
00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:35.329
Of course, people proved that wrong.
当然，后来证明大家是错的

107
00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:37.644
But one of the reasons it succeeded,
但是它成功的一个原因

108
00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:40.378
aside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution,
除了好的商业模式，好创意，强大的执行力之外

109
00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:41.553
is the timing.
就是时机

110
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.119
That company came out right during the height of the recession
就在经济危机的最高潮时，该公司出现了

111
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.609
when people really needed extra money,
这时人们真的很需要挣点外快

112
00:04:46.937 --> 00:04:48.751
and that maybe helped people overcome
这或许帮助人们克服了要把自己的

113
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:51.597
their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger.
房间出租给一个陌生人的障碍

114
00:04:51.597 --> 00:04:52.716
Same thing with Uber.
对于Uber，情况相同

115
00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:53.769
Uber came out,
Uber的诞生

116
00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:56.994
incredible company, incredible business model, great execution, too. 
难以置信的公司，难以置信的商业模式也有强大的执行力

117
00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:58.476
But the timing was so perfect
但当它们需要拉司机进入到这个体系时

118
00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.625
for their need to get drivers into the system.
时机恰好是那么完美

119
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:03.747
Drivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important.
司机们正需要挣外快，这点至关重要

120
00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:07.525
Some of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages.
我们早期的一些成功范例，像Citysearch城市搜索，就在大家需要网页的时候诞生了

121
00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:10.002
GoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998,
GoTo.com，这个我们早在1998年就在Ted上说过

122
00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:13.333
was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic.
是在公司寻找划算的获得流量的方法时诞生的

123
00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:14.905
We thought the idea was so great,
我们曾经认为创意是那么重要

124
00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:17.666
but actually, the timing was probably maybe more important.
然而实际上，时机或许更重要些

125
00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.104
And then some of our failures.
然后是一些失败的例子

126
00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.904
We started a company called Z.com, it was an online entertainment company.
我们曾创立过一个叫Z.com的线上娱乐公司

127
00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.481
We were so excited about it --
我们对此满怀期待

128
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.664
we raised enough money, we had a great business model,
我们筹集了大量的资金，我们有一个很棒的商业模式

129
00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:28.676
we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company.
甚至我们还将伟大的好莱坞天才们签进公司

130
00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:32.524
But broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000.
但1999到2000年的宽带普及程度实在太低

131
00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:34.358
It was too hard to watch video content online,
要想在网上看视频太困难了

132
00:05:34.358 --> 00:05:37.167
you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff,
你不得不向浏览器加入多媒体数字信号编解码器，要加入所有编解码器，

133
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:39.798
and the company eventually went out of business in 2003.
最后这家公司最终在2003年退出了市场

134
00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:40.894
Just two years later,
仅仅在两年之后

135
00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:43.779
when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash
当Adobe flash解决了编解码问题

136
00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.453
and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America,
并且全美的宽带普及度达到50%后

137
00:05:47.453 --> 00:05:49.410
YouTube was perfectly timed.
YouTube正中时机

138
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.139
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.
好的创意，不可思议的时机

139
00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.579
In fact, YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started.
事实上，YouTube一开始都没有一个商业模式

140
00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.409
It wasn't even certain that  that would work out.

But that was beautifully,  beautifully timed.

142
00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:00.548
So what I would say, in summary,

143
00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:03.333
is execution definitely matters a lot.

The idea matters a lot.

145

But timing might matter even more.

146
00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:08.382
And the best way to really assess timing

147
00:06:08.382 --> 00:06:10.999
is to really look at whether consumers are really ready

148

for what you have to offer them.

And to be really, really honest about it,

150
00:06:14.497 --> 00:06:16.758
not be in denial about any results that you see,

151
00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:19.969
because if you have something you love, you want to push it forward,

152
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.439
but you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.
但你不得不对时机这个因素非常非常的诚实

153

As I said earlier,
