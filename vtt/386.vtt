00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.116
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the Guinness Book of World Records,
在我小的时候，对吉尼斯世界纪录大全很着迷，

2
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.596
and I really wanted to set a world record myself.
并且真的很想创造一个属于我自己的世界纪录。

3
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.316
But there was just one small problem:
但是有一个小问题：

4
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.500
I had absolutely no talent.
那就是我完全没有什么天赋。

5
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.660
So I decided to set a world record in something that demanded absolutely no skill at all.
所以我决定去创造一个完全不需要任何技巧就能达成的世界纪录。

6
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
I decided to set a world record in crawling.
我决定去创造一个爬行的世界纪录。

7
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.476
(Laughter)
（笑声）

8
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.020
Now, the record at the time was 12 and a half miles,
当时的纪录是12.5英里，

9
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.836
and for some reason, this seemed totally manageable.
而且出于某种原因这看起来很容易办到。

10
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.020
(Laughter)
（笑声）

11
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.956
I recruited my friend Anne,
我找来了我的朋友安妮，

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.556
and together we decided, we didn't even need to train.
我们一起决定行动了，甚至都不需要训练。

13
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.836
(Laughter)
（笑声）

14
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.676
And on the day of our record attempt,
在我们挑战纪录那一天，

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.356
we put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans
我们将家具垫绑在幸运牛仔裤外面，

16
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.780
and we set off,
然后我们开始了，

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.596
and right away, we were in trouble,
很快，我们就遇到麻烦了，

18
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.716
because the denim was against our skin
因为牛仔布料会产生磨擦，

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.315
and it began to chafe,
开始擦伤皮肤，

20
00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:19.980
and soon our knees were being chewed up.
所以很快我们的膝盖就磨破了。

21
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.940
Hours in,
几个小时后，

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.180
it began to rain.
开始下雨了。

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.780
Then, Anne dropped out.
然后，安妮退出了。

24
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.180
Then, it got dark.
再然后，天黑了。

25
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.316
Now, by now, my knees were bleeding through my jeans,
到了这会儿，我的膝盖血流不止，并且透过了牛仔裤，

26
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.556
and I was hallucinating from the cold
寒冷的天气、疼痛，

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.276
and the pain and the monotony.
以及单调的动作使我产生了幻觉。

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.820
And to give you an idea of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,
可以给你们形容一下我当时遭受的痛苦，

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.060
the first lap around the high school track took 10 minutes.
爬完第一圈跑道花了我们10分钟。

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.500
The last lap took almost 30.
而最后一圈差不多是30分钟。

31
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.236
After 12 hours of crawling,
在12个小时的爬行后，

32
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.596
I stopped,
我停下了，

33
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.500
and I had gone eight and a half miles.
我总共爬了8.5英里。

34
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.356
So I was short of the 12-and-a-half-mile record.
离12.5英里的纪录还有一定距离。

35
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.916
Now, for many years, I thought this was a story of abject failure,
此后很多年，我一直认为这是一个关于悲惨失败的故事，

36
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.436
but today I see it differently,
但是今天我对此有了另一种看法，

37
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.316
because when I was attempting the world record,
因为当我向世界纪录冲刺的时候，

38
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.836
I was doing three things.
我做着三件事。

39
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.196
I was getting outside my comfort zone,
我在走出我的安乐窝，

40
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.476
I was calling upon my resilience,
我在号召我的恢复力，

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.660
and I was finding confidence in myself and my own decisions.
我在为我自己以及我所做的决定找回自信。

42
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.516
I didn't know it then,
当时我并没有意识到，

43
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.460
but those are not the attributes of failure.
但是这些都不是失败所具有的特质。

44
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900
Those are the attributes of bravery.
而是勇气的特征。

45
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.676
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,
到了1989年，我26岁时

46
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.940
I became a San Francisco firefighter,
成为了旧金山的一名消防员，

47
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.796
and I was the 15th woman in a department of 1,500 men.
而我是这个有着1500人的部门中的第15位女性员工。

48
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.580
(Applause)
（掌声）

49
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.916
And as you can imagine, when I arrived
正如你们所想象的，当我入职时

50
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.636
there were many doubts about whether we could do the job.
面临着许多对于我是否能胜作这份工作的质疑。

51
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.996
So even though I was a 5'10", 150-pound collegiate rower,
虽然我曾是身高177cm，体重150磅的大学赛艇手，

52
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.396
and someone who could endure 12 hours of searing knee pain --
并且能够忍受膝盖上长达12个小时的剧烈疼痛——

53
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.036
(Laughter)
（笑声）

54
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.076
I knew I still had to prove my strength and fitness.
但我知道我依然不得不证明我的实力以及我能够适应这里。

55
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.916
So one day a call came in for a fire,
有一天，一个火警电话打了进来，

56
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.179
and sure enough, when my engine group pulled up,
当我们消防小队赶到的时候，我非常确定

57
00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:20.236
there was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway.
滚滚黑烟正从一个小巷中的一栋建筑中冒出。

58
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.476
And I was with a big guy named Skip,
而我当时正跟一个叫做斯基普的大个子在一起，

59
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.236
and he was on the nozzle, and I was right behind,
他在消防车喷头那里，我在他后方，

60
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.076
and it was a typical sort of fire.
这是一次很典型的火灾。

61
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.980
It was smoky, it was hot,
浓烟弥漫，高温炙热，

62
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.196
and all of a sudden,
突然之间

63
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.996
there was an explosion,
发生了爆炸，

64
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.216
and Skip and I were blown backwards,
斯基普和我被震得朝后飞去，

65
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.356
my mask was knocked sideways,
我的面罩被撞到了路边，

66
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.636
and there was this moment of confusion.
这一刻一切都陷入了混乱之中。

67
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.076
And then I picked myself up,
然后我迅速的爬起来，

68
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.916
I groped for the nozzle,
去摸索寻找喷头，

69
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.436
and I did what a firefighter was supposed to do:
我做了一个消防员应该做的：

70
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.196
I lunged forward,
我向前冲过去，

71
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.676
opened up the water
打开了水龙头，

72
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.580
and I tackled the fire myself.
一个人扑灭了大火。

73
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.796
The explosion had been caused by a water heater,
爆炸是由一个热水器引起的，

74
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.516
so nobody was hurt, and ultimately it was not a big deal,
所幸没人受伤，最终也没酿成大的灾难。

75
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.796
but later Skip came up to me and said,
然而稍后斯吉普过来，

76
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.876
"Nice job, Caroline," in this surprised sort of voice.
用那种带着吃惊的声音对我说，“干得好，卡洛琳。”

77
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.500
(Laughter)
（笑声）

78
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.236
And I was confused, because the fire hadn't been difficult physically,
我当时就懵了，因为这场大火并不是很激烈，

79
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.580
so why was he looking at me with something like astonishment?
那么他为什么会用这种惊讶的神情看着我呢？

80
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.956
And then it became clear:
后来我就明白了：

81
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.116
Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy
斯吉普，当然他是一个很好的人，

82
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.356
and an excellent firefighter,
而且也是一个出色的消防员，

83
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.755
not only thought that women could not be strong,
但他不仅不认为女性能够足够强壮，

84
00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.820
he thought that they could not be brave either.
也不认为女性可以非常勇敢。

85
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.180
And he wasn't the only one.
而且他并不是唯一一个这么想的人。

86
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.636
Friends, acquaintances and strangers,
不管是朋友、熟人还是陌生人，

87
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.716
men and women throughout my career
不分男女，在我的整个职业生涯中

88
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.196
ask me over and over,
一遍又一遍的问我，

89
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.420
"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger, aren't you scared?"
“卡洛琳，面对所有的这些大火，所有的这些危险，你害怕过吗？”

90
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.020
Honestly, I never heard a male firefighter asked this.
说实话，我从来没听过一个男消防员被问这些问题。

91
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.260
And I became curious.
所以我变得好奇。

92
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.180
Why wasn't bravery expected of women?
为什么人们都不对女性的勇敢抱有期待？

93
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.116
Now, the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me
当我的一个朋友对我感叹道她年轻的女儿很容易受到惊吓时，

94
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.596
that her young daughter was a big scaredy-cat,
答案在我的脑海中开始显现出来，

95
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.556
and so I began to notice,
从那时起我开始留意，

96
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.276
and yes, the daughter was anxious,
是的，那个朋友的女儿很焦虑，

97
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.060
but more than that, the parents were anxious.
但不仅如此，她的父母也很焦虑。

98
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.196
Most of what they said to her when she was outside began with,
当她去室外玩耍时，她父母对她说得最多的就是，

99
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.820
"Be careful," "Watch out," or "No."
“当心点”、“注意点”或者“不行”。

100
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.396
Now, my friends were not bad parents.
我朋友他们是很好的父母。

101
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.116
They were just doing what most parents do,
他们只是做了大部分父母做的，

102
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.140
which is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons.
即对女儿的担心程度要比儿子大得多。

103
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.340
There was a study involving a playground fire pole, ironically,
曾经有一个涉及到游乐场里消防滑杆的研究，讽刺的是，

104
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.116
in which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be warned by both their moms and dads about the fire pole's risk,
研究人员发现小女孩通常很有可能会被她的父母们警告消防滑杆的危险性，

105
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.596
and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole,
如果那个小女孩还是想要玩消防滑杆，

106
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.340
a parent was very likely to assist her.
那么父母中的一个会很可能陪伴她一起玩。

107
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.380
But the little boys?
但是如果换成小男孩子呢？

108
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.756
They were encouraged to play on the fire pole
他们通常被鼓励去玩消防滑杆，

109
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.716
despite any trepidations that they might have,
也不管他们是否会害怕，

110
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.860
and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own.
并且通常父母会指导他们怎样独自去玩消防滑杆。

111
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.260
So what message does this send to both boys and girls?
那么这个行为给这些男孩和女孩传递了怎样的信息呢？

112
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.676
Well, that girls are fragile and more in need of help,
那就是，女孩是脆弱的，更需要获得帮助，

113
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.740
and that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves.
而男孩能够并且应该自己处理好困难的任务。

114
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.076
It says that girls should be fearful
人们说女孩应该谨小慎微，

115
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.420
and boys should be gutsy.
而男孩应该勇敢。

116
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.476
Now, the irony is that at this young age,
但讽刺的地方是在这么小的年纪，

117
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.996
girls and boys are actually very alike physically.
事实上男孩和女孩在身体上是非常相似的。

118
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.676
In fact, girls are often stronger until puberty,
事实上，在青春期之前女孩通常更强壮，

119
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.940
and more mature.
也更成熟。

120
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.276
And yet we adults act
然而我们成年人表现出来的却是

121
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.636
as if girls are more fragile
好像女孩子更加的脆弱，

122
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.596
and more in need of help,
更需要帮助，

123
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.300
and they can't handle as much.
以及她们不能应付很多事情。

124
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.556
This is the message that we absorb as kids,
这是我们从小就接受的信息，

125
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.276
and this is the message that fully permeates as we grow up.
这个信息也渗透进我们整个成长的过程中。

126
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.756
We women believe it, men believe it,
我们女人相信这一点，男人也相信这一点，

127
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.316
and guess what?
猜一下怎么着？

128
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.676
As we become parents, we pass it on to our children,
当我们成为父母时，我们把它又传给了下一代，

129
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.020
and so it goes.
就这样一代代传下去。

130
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.036
Well, so now I had my answer.
现在我已经有了答案。

131
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.636
This is why women, even firewomen,
这就是为什么女人，甚至是女消防员，

132
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.756
were expected to be scared.
也被认为是胆怯的。

133
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.860
This is why women often are scared.
这也是为什么女人通常胆小害怕的原因。

134
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.876
Now, I know some of you won't believe me when I tell you this,
我知道你们中的一部分人不会相信我跟你说的这些，

135
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.380
but I am not against fear.
但是我并不是反对恐惧感。

136
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.836
I know it's an important emotion, and it's there to keep us safe.
我知道它是一种很重要的情绪，使我们保持安全。

137
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:28.060
But the problem is when fear is the primary reaction that we teach and encourage in girls whenever they face something outside their comfort zone.
但是如果每当我们的女儿在外遇到困难，我们的第一反应就是教导和鼓励她们去害怕的话，这就是个问题了。

138
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.220
So I was a paraglider pilot for many years --
我曾经做过很多年的滑翔伞运动员——

139
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.516
(Applause)
（掌声）

140
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.956
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,
滑翔伞就是一个像降落伞一样的翅膀，

141
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.716
and it does fly very well,
它能够很好的飞翔，

142
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.156
but to many people I realize it looks just like a bedsheet with strings attached.
但是我意识到对很多人来说它看起来就像是一张系了绳子的床单。

143
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.356
(Laughter)
(笑声）

144
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.836
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.436
inflating this bedsheet,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.140
running off and flying.

And you're right, it does.

I assure you, I did feel fear.

151
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.276
But on that mountaintop,
但是站在山顶上，

152
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.356
waiting for the wind to come in just right,
等待正确的风向时，

153
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.596

155
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.596
I knew I was a good pilot.

159
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.036
but I would take a good hard look at it,

and then put it where it belonged,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.740

163
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.236
So I'm not against fear.
因此我不是反对害怕。

164
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.780
I'm just pro-bravery.

168
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.036
and it begins when we caution them against physical risk.

The fear we learn and the experiences we don't

172
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.116
our hesitation in speaking out,

173
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.796
our deference so that we can be liked

174
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.540
and our lack of confidence in our own decisions.

They call it risky play,
