﻿1
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.860
Science.
科学。

2
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.996
The very word for many of you conjures unhappy memories of boredom
这个词对于你们中的很多人来说， 召唤了对于高中生物

3
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.916
in high school biology or physics class.
或是物理课堂的苦闷记忆。

4
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.036
But let me assure that what you did there
但是我向你们保证， 你们在那时经历的

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.236
had very little to do with science.
与科学是大相径庭的。

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.556
That was really the "what" of science.
那只是科学“是什么”。

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.300
It was the history of what other people had discovered.
那是前人发现的历史记载。

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.876
What I'm most interested in as a scientist
我对于成为一名科学家 最感兴趣的地方

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.036
is the "how" of science.
是科学的“为什么”。

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.876
Because science is knowledge in process.
因为科学的知识是正在探寻中的。

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.356
We make an observation, guess an explanation for that observation,
我们进行观察， 对观察提出一种设想原因，

12
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.436
and then make a prediction that we can test
做一种可以通过实验或是

13
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.380
with an experiment or other observation.
其他观察论证的假设。

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.236
A couple of examples.
举些例子。

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.836
First of all, people noticed that the Earth was below, the sky above,
首先，人们注意到了 大地在脚下，天空在头顶，

16
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.740
and both the Sun and the Moon seemed to go around them.
太阳和月亮都看似 围绕着它们在移动

17
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.076
Their guessed explanation
他们提出的设想是

18
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.180
was that the Earth must be the center of the universe.
地球一定是宇宙的中心。

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.260
The prediction: everything should circle around the Earth.
预测即为：一切都是围绕着地球运动的。

20
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.596
This was first really tested
当伽里略着手于第一台望远镜，

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.436
when Galileo got his hands on one of the first telescopes,
望向天空的时候，这件事第一次

22
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.836
and as he gazed into the night sky,
被真正测试了，

23
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.556
what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,
他发现的是一颗行星，木星，

24
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.580
with four moons circling around it.
周围还有四颗卫星环绕着它。

25
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.956
He then used those moons to follow the path of Jupiter
之后，他又利用这些卫星 去跟踪木星的轨道

26
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.716
and found that Jupiter also was not going around the Earth
发现木星也不是围绕地球运动的

27
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.700
but around the Sun.
而是围绕太阳运动的。

28
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.260
So the prediction test failed.
所以说这个假说测试就失败了。

29
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.316
And this led to the discarding of the theory
这就导致了地球是宇宙的中心

30
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.516
that the Earth was the center of the universe.
这个理论被推翻。

31
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.636
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton noticed that things fall to the Earth.
另一个例子：艾萨克·牛顿爵士 注意到了东西都是向地面坠落的。

32
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.580
The guessed explanation was gravity,
设想原因是引力，

33
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.476
the prediction that everything should fall to the Earth.
预测是万物都会落向地面。

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.060
But of course, not everything does fall to the Earth.
但是当然，并不是 所有东西都落向地面的。

35
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.580
So did we discard gravity?
但是我们就抛弃引力吗？

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.156
No. We revised the theory and said, gravity pulls things to the Earth
不。我们重新改写理论， 说引力将万物拉向地面，

37
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.380
unless there is an equal and opposite force in the other direction.
除非事物还受到大小相同 方向相反的力的作用。

38
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.140
This led us to learn something new.
这引领我们学到了新的东西。

39
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.996
We began to pay more attention to the bird and the bird's wings,
我们开始更多的关注 鸟儿和它们的翅膀，

40
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.396
and just think of all the discoveries
想一想从那条思路

41
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.459
that have flown from that line of thinking.
引出的一系列发现。

42
00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.596
So the test failures, the exceptions, the outliers
所以那些测试的 失败，意外，异常值

43
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.180
teach us what we don't know and lead us to something new.
给我们传授了未知， 引领我们去发现新的东西。

44
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.020
This is how science moves forward. This is how science learns.
科学就是这样不断前行。 科学就是这样不断学习。

45
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.916
Sometimes in the media, and even more rarely,
有的时候在媒体当中， 甚至更罕见的，

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.356
but sometimes even scientists will say
有时甚至科学家们会说

47
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.140
that something or other has been scientifically proven.
这个或是那个 已经被科学证明了。

48
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.276
But I hope that you understand that science never proves anything
但是，我希望你们能够明白， 科学从不能证明任何东西，

49
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.180
definitively forever.
永远都不可能。

50
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.156
Hopefully science remains curious enough
希望科学始终保持那种好奇感

51
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.596
to look for
让我们去探寻，

52
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.596
and humble enough to recognize
和那种谦逊感，

53
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.116
when we have found
当我们发现下一个异常值，

54
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.836
the next outlier,
下一个特例，

55
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.356
the next exception,
就像木星的卫星 那样的东西的时候，

56
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.676
which, like Jupiter's moons,
能够让我们去认识，

57
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.300
teaches us what we don't actually know.
教会我们那些我们并不了解的东西。

58
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.516
We're going to change gears here for a second.
我们要在这里变换一小会儿主题了。

59
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.476
The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,
墨丘利的节杖， 或者说是医药的象征，

60
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.956
means a lot of different things to different people,
对于不同的人，有着不同的意义，

61
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.236
but most of our public discourse on medicine
但是我们的普遍公共医学论述

62
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.036
really turns it into an engineering problem.
却将它转变为了一个工程问题。

63
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.796
We have the hallways of Congress,
我们的国会长廊，

64
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.820
and the boardrooms of insurance companies that try to figure out how to pay for it.
还有保险公司的董事会 都试图找到支付它们的途径

65
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.116
The ethicists and epidemiologists
伦理学家和流行病学家

66
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.836
try to figure out how best to distribute medicine,
试图找到如何更好分配药物的方法，

67
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.516
and the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed
医院和医生们却完全沉迷于

68
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.476
with their protocols and checklists,
他们的协议和清单，

69
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.036
trying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine.
试图找到更安全应用药物的方法。

70
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.180
These are all good things.
这些都是好事。

71
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.516
However, they also all assume
但是，他们也都在

72
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.516
at some level
一定程度上假定了

73
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.060
that the textbook of medicine is closed.
医学教科书是封闭的。

74
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.476
We start to measure the quality of our health care
我们就开始以我们能 多快速的得到医疗服务

75
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.036
by how quickly we can access it.
来衡量我们的医疗质量。

76
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.156
It doesn't surprise me that in this climate,
在这种风气下， 许多机构

77
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.996
many of our institutions for the provision of health care
为寻求医疗服务， 开始大批搜寻润滑油的行为，

78
00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:03.516
start to look a heck of a lot like Jiffy Lube.
一点儿也不使我惊讶。

79
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.116
(Laughter)
（笑声）

80
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.076
The only problem is that when I graduated from medical school,
唯一的问题是， 当我从医学院毕业的时候，

81
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.156
I didn't get one of those little doohickeys
我并没有得到那个 像是你的机械师

82
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.556
that your mechanic has to plug into your car
一插进你的汽车里就能知道

83
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.956
and find out exactly what's wrong with it,
车子哪里出问题的小窍门，

84
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.076
because the textbook of medicine
因为医学课本

85
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.620
is not closed.
并非是封闭的。

86
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.980
Medicine is science.
医药是科学。

87
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.060
Medicine is knowledge in process.
医药是正在进程中的知识。

88
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.476
We make an observation,
我们先观察现象，

89
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.635
we guess an explanation of that observation,
然后猜测现象背后的解释，

90
00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.276
and then we make a prediction that we can test.
之后我们作出一个 能够被测试的假设

91
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.876
Now, the testing ground of most predictions in medicine
当下，我们在医药领域 大多数的测试场地就是

92
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.436
is populations.
群体。

93
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.036
And you may remember from those boring days in biology class
然后也许你还记得 在那些无聊的生物课上

94
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.236
that populations tend to distribute
关于群体倾向于呈现

95
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.476
around a mean
围绕平均值的

96
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.356
as a Gaussian or a normal curve.
高斯或是正态分布曲线。

97
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.036
Therefore, in medicine,
因此，在医药领域，

98
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.276
after we make a prediction from a guessed explanation,
在我们用一种可能的原因 作出预测之后，

99
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.180
we test it in a population.
我们就在群体中测试它。

100
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.076
That means that what we know in medicine,
这就意味着，我们 关于医药学习的知识，

101
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.356
our knowledge and our know-how,
我们的所有知识，

102
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.636
comes from populations
都来自于群体，

103
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.436
but extends only as far
而只有当达到 下一个异常值的时候，

104
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.196
as the next outlier,
下一个特例，

105
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.436
the next exception,
就像是木星卫星 那样的特例的时候，

106
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.196
which, like Jupiter's moons,
我们的知识才会扩张，

107
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.620
will teach us what we don't actually know.
它们教会了我们并不了解的东西。

108
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.236
Now, I am a surgeon
现在，我是一名外科医生，

109
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.676
who looks after patients with sarcoma.
正在寻找肉瘤病人。

110
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.900
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.
肉瘤是一种极其罕见的癌症。

111
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.580
It's the cancer of flesh and bones.
是骨与肌肉的癌变。

112
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.396
And I would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier,
然后我会告诉你， 我的每一位病人都是异常值，

113
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.620
is an exception.
都是特例。

114
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.036
There is no surgery I have ever performed for a sarcoma patient
我为这些肉瘤患者做的手术， 没有任何一个是对照着，

115
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.316
that has ever been guided by a randomized controlled clinical trial,
临床实验案例，就是那些 我们认识中最适合医药的

116
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.060
what we consider the best kind of population-based evidence in medicine.
以群体为基础的实验证据， 没有任何一个是被其指导着完成的。

117
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.516
People talk about thinking outside the box,
人们总说要跳出定式思维，

118
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.276
but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.
但是在肉瘤病症上，我们没有定式。

119
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.636
What we do have as we take a bath in the uncertainty
当我们沐浴在 关于肉瘤的，环绕我们的，

120
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.796
and unknowns and exceptions and outliers that surround us in sarcoma
那些未知，不确定， 特例，异常值中的时候，

121
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.356
is easy access to what I think are those two most important values
我们所拥有的，是我眼中 对于任何一种科学，

122
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.916
for any science:
最重要的两种价值观：

123
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.140
humility and curiosity.
谦逊和好奇心。

124
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.116
Because if I am humble and curious,
因为如果我是谦逊的，好奇心强的，

125
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.436
when a patient asks me a question,
当病人询问我问题的时候，

126
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.900
and I don't know the answer,
如果我不知道问题的答案，

127
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.956
I'll ask a colleague
我就会去询问有着相似的，

128
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.996
who may have a similar albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.
尽管是不同的肉瘤病人的同事。

129
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.716
We'll even establish international collaborations.
我们甚至会建立国际间的合作。

130
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.876
Those patients will start to talk to each other through chat rooms
那些病人也会开始 在聊天室和支持团体中

131
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.100
and support groups.
互相交流。

132
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.196
It's through this kind of humbly curious communication
是通过这种谦逊的， 好奇的交流过程，

133
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.780
that we begin to try and learn new things.
我们开始去尝试并学习新的知识。

134
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.116
As an example, this is a patient of mine
作为例子，这是我的一位病人

135
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.820
who had a cancer near his knee.
他在膝盖附近长了一个肿瘤。

136
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.676
Because of humbly curious communication
正因为那种在国际合作中谦逊的

137
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.796
in international collaborations,
好奇心驱使的沟通,

138
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.356
we have learned that we can repurpose the ankle to serve as the knee
我们学习到了如果必须 在移除肿瘤的同时移除膝盖，

139
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.636
when we have to remove the knee with the cancer.
那么我们可以用踝关节 代替膝关节的位置。

140
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.500
He can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play.
这样他就可以带着假肢 跑，跳，玩耍了。

141
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.196
This opportunity was available to him
是国际间合作

142
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.996
because of international collaborations.
给了他这样的机会。

143
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.716
It was desirable to him
这也是他所希望的，

144
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.700
because he had contacted other patients who had experienced it.
因为他与经历过这些的 其他病人联系过了。

145
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.796
And so exceptions and outliers in medicine
所以在医药领域的特例与异常值

146
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.780
teach us what we don't know, but also lead us to new thinking.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.956
We often talk about losing the forests for the trees,

162
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.596
makes those relationships that define a tree,

166
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.876
or even if that tree has very unusual relationships
