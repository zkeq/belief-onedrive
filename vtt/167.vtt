1
00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:17.041
So a friend of mine was riding in a taxi to the airport the other day,
某天，我的一位朋友乘出租车去机场。

2
00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:19.775
and on the way, she was chatting with the taxi driver,
在路上，她跟出租车司机闲聊，

3
00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.228
and he said to her, with total sincerity,
他用非常真诚的语气对她说：

4
00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.538
"I can tell you are a really good person."
“我看得出你是个好人。”

5
00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.379
And when she told me this story later,
当她后来告诉我这个故事时，

6
00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.578
she said she couldn't believe how good it made her feel,
她说这让她感到无比的开心，

7
00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.661
that it meant a lot to her.
那句话对她的意义重大。

8
00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.711
Now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend
这看起来像是我朋友对陌生人话语的

9
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.939
to the words of a total stranger,
一种强烈反应，

10
00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:39.581
but she's not alone.
但她并非特例。

11
00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:40.970
I'm a social scientist.
我是一个社会科学家。

12
00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:43.647
I study the psychology of good people,
我研究关于好人的心理学，

13
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:47.961
and research in my field says many of us care deeply
这个领域的研究显示， 大家对自认为是“好人”，

14
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:52.986
about feeling like a good person and being seen as a good person.
和被他人视为”好人“ 的感觉颇为在意。

15
00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:58.120
Now, your definition of "good person" and your definition of "good person"
你对“好人”的定义， 或是你对“好人”的定义，

16
00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:00.884
and maybe the taxi driver's definition of "good person" --
可能跟出租车司机定义的“好人”不同，

17
00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:02.891
we may not all have the same definition,
我们也许没有相同的定义，

18
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:05.740
but within whatever our definition is,
但不管我们的定义是什么，

19
00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.565
that moral identity is important to many of us.
这种道德认同对我们很多人都很重要。

20
00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:14.195
Now, if somebody challenges it, like they question us for a joke we tell,
如果有人挑战这个事实， 比如他质疑我们讲的笑话，

21
00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.902
or maybe we say our workforce is homogenous,
或者他说我们的劳动是同质的，

22
00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:19.905
or a slippery business expense,
或者是一笔狡猾的商业支出，

23
00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.127
we go into red-zone defensiveness a lot of the time.
我们在这些时候会 进入一种“红区警戒”状态。

24
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.242
I mean, sometimes we call out
我的意思是，有时候我们会用

25
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.935
all the ways in which we help people from marginalized groups,
各种方式来帮助那些处于社会边缘的人，

26
00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.727
or we donate to charity,
或者向慈善组织捐赠，

27
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:35.790
or the hours we volunteer to nonprofits.
或者自愿成为非营利组织的义工。

28
00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:39.505
We work to protect that good person identity.
我们努力捍卫这种好人的身份，

29
00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.465
It's important to many of us.
这对我们多数人都很重要。

30
00:01:42.337 --> 00:01:44.195
But what if I told you this?
但如果我告诉你们，

31
00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.933
What if I told you that our attachment to being good people
我们对做好人的向往

32
00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:51.473
is getting in the way of us being better people?
会阻止我们成为更好的人呢？

33
00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:58.371
What if I told you that our definition of "good person" is so narrow,
如果我告诉你们， 我们对“好人”的定义很狭隘，

34
00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.926
it's scientifically impossible to meet?
在科学角度上是无法实现的呢？

35
00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:04.903
And what if I told you the path to being better people
又如果我告诉们，你成为更好的人的路径

36
00:02:04.927 --> 00:02:07.863
just begins with letting go of being a good person?
只需从抛弃做一个好人开始呢？

37
00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:11.336
Now, let me tell you a little bit about the research
那么，让我告诉你们一些

38
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.832
about how the human mind works
有关人类大脑是如何运作的研究，

39
00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:14.006
to explain.
来解释我的说法。

40
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.468
The brain relies on shortcuts to do a lot of its work.
大脑依靠捷径完成很多工作，

41
00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:20.117
That means a lot of the time,
这意味着大部分时间，

42
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:23.469
your mental processes are taking place outside of your awareness,
你的思维过程发生在你的意识之外，

43
00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:28.231
like in low-battery, low-power mode in the back of your mind.
就像大脑处于低电量、低功耗模式下。

44
00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:32.369
That's, in fact, the premise of bounded rationality.
其实，这是“有限理性”的前提。

45
00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:35.834
Bounded rationality is the Nobel Prize-winning idea
“有限理性”是诺贝尔奖得主的观点，

46
00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:38.700
that the human mind has limited storage resources,
人类大脑的存储资源是有限的，

47
00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.820
limited processing power,
处理能力是有限的，

48
00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:44.876
and as a result, it relies on shortcuts to do a lot of its work.
因此，它依靠捷径来完成很多工作。

49
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.915
So for example,
所以举个例子，

50
00:02:47.653 --> 00:02:50.287
some scientists estimate that in any given moment ...
有些科学家估计在任何时刻…

51
00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:53.200
Better, better click, right? There we go.
比如打个响指的瞬间， 再来一次，这下打响了吧?

52
00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:54.201
(Laughter)
（笑声）

53
00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:55.469
At any given moment,
在任意一个瞬间，

54
00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:59.297
11 million pieces of information are coming into your mind.
数以千万计的信息会涌入你的大脑。

55
00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:01.490
Eleven million.
整整1100万。

56
00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.387
And only 40 of them are being processed consciously.
而其中只有四十个被有意识地处理。

57
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.093
So 11 million, 40.
所以 1100万 和 40 做下对比。

58
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.844
I mean, has this ever happened to you?
你有没有经历过这样的事？

59
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:12.222
Have you ever had a really busy day at work,
在工作超忙的一天，

60
00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:13.975
and you drive home,
你开车回家，

61
00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.217
and when you get in the door,
到家门口时，

62
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.489
you realize you don't even remember the drive home,
发现你甚至不记得驾车时的事，

63
00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.016
like whether you had green lights or red lights.
比如是否过了红灯或绿灯。

64
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.450
You don't even remember. You were on autopilot.
你甚至不记得这些。 你当时相当于是在“自动驾驶”模式下。

65
00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:28.081
Or have you ever opened the fridge,
或者你有没有开过冰箱，

66
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:30.177
looked for the butter,
寻找黄油，

67
00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:33.145
swore there is no butter,
发誓没有黄油的痕迹，

68
00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.786
and then realized the butter was right in front of you the whole time?
然后才意识到黄油一直就在你面前？

69
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.331
These are the kinds of "whoops" moments that make us giggle,
这些都是回想起来 让我们觉得好笑的时刻，

70
00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.366
and this is what happens in a brain
这就是大脑为了应付

71
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.964
that can handle 11 million pieces of information coming in
1100万条涌进来的信息，

72
00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:48.565
with only 40 being processed consciously.
但只有 40 条被有意识处理时所发生的事。

73
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.969
That's the bounded part of bounded rationality.
这就是“有限理性"的有限部分。

74
00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:57.649
This work on bounded rationality
这个关于有限理性的研究

75
00:03:57.673 --> 00:04:01.839
is what's inspired work I've done with my collaborators
提供了我和我的搭档

76
00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.498
Max Bazerman and Mahzarin Banaji,
马克斯 · 巴泽曼 和 马扎林 · 巴纳吉

77
00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:07.168
on what we call bounded ethicality.
研究“有限道德”的灵感来源。

78
00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:10.594
So it's the same premise as bounded rationality,
这和“有限理性”的前提是一样的，

79
00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:16.219
that we have a human mind that is bounded in some sort of way
我们的大脑是受束缚的，

80
00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:18.325
and relying on shortcuts,
它需要依赖捷径，

81
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.174
and that those shortcuts can sometimes lead us astray.
并且这个捷径有时候会让我们误入歧途。

82
00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:24.231
With bounded rationality,
考虑到人的有限理性，

83
00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:27.941
perhaps it affects the cereal we buy in the grocery store,
可能它会影响我们在杂货店买的麦片，

84
00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:31.048
or the product we launch in the boardroom.
或者我们在会议室推出的产品。

85
00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:34.339
With bounded ethicality, the human mind,
当“有限道德”发生时，人类的大脑，

86
00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:36.442
the same human mind,
如同有限理性一样，

87
00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:37.958
is making decisions,
在做出决策。

88
00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:40.768
and here, it's about who to hire next,
比如 要雇佣谁？

89
00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:42.442
or what joke to tell
去讲什么笑话？

90
00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.688
or that slippery business decision.
或是那个狡猾的商业决策。

91
00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:50.580
So let me give you an example of bounded ethicality at work.
那么让我给你们一个有限道德 体现在工作中的案例。

92
00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:53.390
Unconscious bias is one place
“无意识偏见”是

93
00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:56.923
where we see the effects of bounded ethicality.
“有限道德”体现出的一个方面。

94
00:04:56.947 --> 00:05:01.333
So unconscious bias refers to associations we have in our mind,
“无意识偏见”指我们大脑中的联想，

95
00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:05.647
the shortcuts your brain is using to organize information,
那些大脑用来组织信息的捷径，

96
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.935
very likely outside of your awareness,
很可能在你的意识之外，

97
00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.411
not necessarily lining up with your conscious beliefs.
不一定会符合你的意识信念。

98
00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:14.847
Researchers Nosek, Banaji and Greenwald
研究者 诺斯，巴纳吉 和 格林沃尔德

99
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.602
have looked at data from millions of people,
看过了数百万人的数据，

100
00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:20.383
and what they've found is, for example,
他们发现的是，例如：

101
00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:23.900
most white Americans can more quickly and easily
多数美国白人能够更快和更轻松地

102
00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:28.193
associate white people and good things
把白人和好事联系起来，

103
00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:30.510
than black people and good things,
而非黑人和好事，

104
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.084
and most men and women can more quickly and easily associate
而且多数人更倾向于 把男性跟科学家联系起来，

105
00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:41.410
men and science than women and science.
而不是把女性和科学家联系起来。

106
00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:46.244
And these associations don't necessarily line up
而这些联系不一定

107
00:05:46.268 --> 00:05:48.143
with what people consciously think.
与人们有意识的想法一致。

108
00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:51.500
They may have very egalitarian views, in fact.
事实上，他们可能有非常平等的观点。

109
00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:56.439
So sometimes, that 11 million and that 40 just don't line up.
所以有时候，1100万与40 的 对比并不是很合理。

110
00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:59.189
And here's another example:
这是另外一个例子：

111
00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:00.705
conflicts of interest.
利益冲突。

112
00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:05.002
So we tend to underestimate how much a small gift --
我们往往会低估一个小礼物的作用——

113
00:06:05.026 --> 00:06:08.669
imagine a ballpoint pen or dinner --
比如一支圆珠笔或一顿晚餐——

114
00:06:08.693 --> 00:06:12.851
how much that small gift can affect our decision making.
这个小礼物能对我们的决策 产生多大的影响。

115
00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:17.998
We don't realize that our mind is unconsciously lining up evidence
我们意识不到自己的大脑 会无意识地收集证据

116
00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:21.553
to support the point of view of the gift-giver,
来支持送礼人的观点，

117
00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:26.398
no matter how hard we're consciously trying to be objective and professional.
无论我们多么努力地保持客观和专业。

118
00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.228
We also see bounded ethicality --
我们也能看到有界的道德——

119
00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:32.629
despite our attachment to being good people,
即便我们希望当一个好人，

120
00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:34.734
we still make mistakes,
我们仍会犯错，

121
00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:38.769
and we make mistakes that sometimes hurt other people,
我们犯的错误有时候会伤害他人，

122
00:06:38.793 --> 00:06:41.263
that sometimes promote injustice,
有时候会促进不公，

123
00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:43.312
despite our best attempts,
尽管我们尽了最大的努力，

124
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:47.453
and we explain away our mistakes rather than learning from them.
我们还为自己的错误辩解， 而不是从中学习。

125
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.083
Like, for example,
比如说，

126
00:06:51.107 --> 00:06:54.908
when I got an email from a female student in my class
有天我收到了班上女同学的电邮，

127
00:06:54.932 --> 00:06:57.480
saying that a reading I had assigned,
说我布置的阅读材料，

128
00:06:57.504 --> 00:07:00.258
a reading I had been assigning for years,
这个我指定了好些年的阅读材料，

129
00:07:00.282 --> 00:07:01.713
was sexist.
有性别歧视。

130
00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:08.146
Or when I confused two students in my class
或者当我把班上同种族的

131
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.527
of the same race --
两个学生弄混时——

132
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:11.821
look nothing alike --
他们俩看起来一点也不像——

133
00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:14.004
when I confused them for each other
当我在大家面前，

134
00:07:14.028 --> 00:07:16.693
more than once, in front of everybody.
不止一次把他们弄混时。

135
00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:22.028
These kinds of mistakes send us, send me,
这些类型的错误让我们……让我，

136
00:07:22.052 --> 00:07:24.887
into red-zone defensiveness.
进入了”红色警戒区“。

137
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.141
They leave us fighting for that good person identity.
它们让我们为好人的身份而战。

138
00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:34.349
But the latest work that I've been doing on bounded ethicality with Mary Kern
但是我最近和 玛丽 · 克恩  做的关于有限道德的研究

139
00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:37.945
says that we're not only prone to mistakes --
发现我们不仅容易犯错，

140
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:43.208
that tendency towards mistakes depends on how close we are to that red zone.
犯错的倾向还取决于 我们离红色区域的距离。

141
00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:47.431
So most of the time, nobody's challenging our good person identity,
大多数时候， 没人质疑我们的好人身份。

142
00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:49.614
and so we're not thinking too much
所以我们也没有想太多

143
00:07:49.638 --> 00:07:51.971
about the ethical implications of our decisions,
关于我们决定的伦理意义，

144
00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:55.874
and our model shows that we're then spiraling

145
00:07:55.898 --> 00:08:00.637
towards less and less ethical behavior most of the time.

146
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.509
On the other hand, somebody might challenge our identity,

or, upon reflection, we may be challenging it ourselves.

148
00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:11.180
So the ethical implications of our decisions become really salient,

149
00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:16.941
and in those cases, we spiral towards more and more good person behavior,

150
00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:18.806
or, to be more precise,

151
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.368
towards more and more behavior that makes us feel like a good person,

152
00:08:23.392 --> 00:08:25.836
which isn't always the same, of course.

153
00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:30.876
The idea with bounded ethicality

154
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.102
is that we are perhaps overestimating
我们可能高估了

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:40.294
the importance our inner compass is playing in our ethical decisions.

is driving our decisions,

158
00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:53.938

159
00:08:53.962 --> 00:08:56.486
is affecting our behavior,

160

to keep out of that red zone,

00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:16.859
It's perhaps because we expect it to be easy.
