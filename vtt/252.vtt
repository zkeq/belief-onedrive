How many in here have heard of the Swedish Pirate Party before?

Let's see a show of hands.

OK, that's practically everybody.
好吧，基本上每个人 都有听说过，

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.316
Probably due to the fact that we are Sweden's neighbor.

19
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.916
I frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.556
and there's always just scattered hands in the audience
在观众中只是零零星星几个人。

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.036
compared to this first question which is one-half to two-thirds.

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.756
This is actually the first time ever that does not match.

It was practically everybody.
几乎所有人都举手了。

24
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.716
So, for those who haven't heard of us:

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100
well, the Pirate Party, we love the net.

We love copying and sharing, and we love civil liberties.

27
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.780
For that, some people call us pirates.
因为那些原因， 有些人把我们叫做海盗（盗版）。

28
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.716
Probably in an attempt to make us bow our heads and feel shame.

29
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.076

We decided to stand tall about it instead.

31
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.076
And so in 2006, I founded a new political party.

32
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.356
I led it for its first five years.

33
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.756

36
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.756
And what's interesting is we did that
我们用了不到竞争者1%的预算

37
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.220
on less than one percent of the competition's budget.

They had six million between them -- and we beat them.

That gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude.
我们的成本效率优势 是其他党派的两个数量级。

41
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.420
And I'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that.
现在我将要分享 我们的成功秘笈。

42
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.060
We developed swarm methodologies.

that hasn't even been around for a decade.

56
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.460
So today we're going to talk a bit about --

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.996
Let's see: we're going to Mars,
让我们看看：我们要去火星，

145
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.156
we need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists,
我们需要24个火箭科学家志愿者，

146
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.116
one dozen volunteer metallurgists,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.900
and so on.

149
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.676
When you can list the resources, you know what you need to get there.
当你能列出资源清单， 你知道到达那你需要什么。

150
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.620

当你知道需要什么才能到达那， 你就可以去那。

151
00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:41.790
And the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence,
然后下一个事情是鼓励 这个集群智慧的发展，

152
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.780
which is where the cost efficiency comes in.
这正是成本效率显现的地方。

153
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:52.260
There's a TED Talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money,
有一个TED的演讲 打破了我们为钱工作这一谎言，

154
00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:59.436
and it presents science on how we're really motivated by three things,
它用科学证明了 当我们面对大型的创意性工作时，

155
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.116
in terms of larger creative tasks,
当我们投身于比自己更大的号召时，

156
00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:03.916
when we work for something bigger than ourselves.

158
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.956
We've covered purpose already.

159
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.060
As in, working for something bigger, tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.
就是为一些更远大的，切实的 可信的，包容的和伟大的事情工作。

160
00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:22.560
So, where that motivation talk ends,
那个 TED 演讲结束时，

161
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.716
what it doesn't answer is,
它没有回答的是，

162
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.620
how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power.

163
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.996
And this is where working swarmwise comes in,
这正是集群参与的意义，

164
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.846
this is where swarm intelligence comes in.
这就是集群智能起作用的地方。

165
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.460
Turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for --
我们发现，有三个需要你去优化的因素，

166
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.500
and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school.
每一个都和你在 商学院学到的完全相反。

167
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.620

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.636
We know it works.

169
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.540
We have people in many, many parliaments to prove it.
我党成功进入 许多议会的成员就可以证明这点。

170
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.500
Those three factors are: speed, trust and scalability.

171
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.476
We optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop,

172
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.356
cutting them out of the decision loop.

which can be hard.
这会很艰难。

179
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.980
And when tens of thousands of people do that on a weekly basis,

180
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.020
you become an unstoppable force.
你就成为一股不可阻止的力量。

181
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.596
We had a three-person rule in our organization,
我们组织里有一条三人原则，

182
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.996
saying that if three self-identified volunteers in the movement

We made mistakes. We should expect mistakes.
我们会犯错误， 我们也应该预期到错误。

204
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.116
If you're pioneering something, that means you must, by definition,

venture into the unknown.

也许在我们尝试了15次后， 我们掌握到了特定技能，

216
00:12:27.876 --> 00:12:31.090
We optimize on trust. We encourage diversity.

那是商业院教你的东西——它行不通。

224
00:12:55.396 --> 00:13:00.296
Or at least, it doesn't give you the cost-efficiency advantage
或者至少，它不会给你 带来集群工作的

225
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.700
of working swarmwise.

in different social groups

what those guys are doing,

234
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.276
that's OK because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement.
这是可接受的，因为我们相信 彼此都是为了更好的运动工作。

235
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.756
And it's OK that I don't understand their social context.

240
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.156
Again, in business school, they teach you to use a lean organization.
再一次，在商学院，他们教授你 使用精简的组织结构。

241
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.380
Forget that.

242
00:13:51.886 --> 00:13:54.220
Just scale up the organization from the get-go.

And this is when a swarm intelligence emerges.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.996
This is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what's to be done.
你就有了蜂箱逻辑， 每个人都知道该做什么。

257
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.860

258
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:53.156
So the swarm starts to act as a coherent organism.

259
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.140
And it's amazing to watch.
