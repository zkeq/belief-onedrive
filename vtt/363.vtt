The most astounding place I've ever been is the Mosquitia Rain Forest in Honduras.
我去过的最震撼的地方。是洪都拉斯的莫斯基蒂亚雨林。

2
00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:21.660
I've done archaeological fieldwork all over the world,
我在世界各地都做过考古调查，

3
00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.771
so I thought I knew what to expect venturing into the jungle,
所以我以为我知道丛林冒险会发生什么，

4
00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.236
but I was wrong.

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.873
For the first time in my life, I might add.

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:31.206
(Laughter)
（笑声）

7
00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:34.155
First of all, it's freezing.
首先，太冷了。

8
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:37.512
It's 90 degrees, but you're soaking wet from the humidity,
气温虽然是32摄氏度，但湿度很大，我浑身湿透，

9
00:00:37.512 --> 00:00:42.055
and the canopy of trees is so thick that sunlight never reaches the surface.
因为树冠浓密阳光永远不会到达地面。

10
00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.830
You can't get dry.

Immediately, I knew that I hadn't brought enough clothing.

It's like being downtown in a bustling city.

As the night wore on,
随着夜晚过去，

18
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.601
I became increasingly frustrated with my sleeplessness,

When I finally got up at dawn,

23
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.643
linear snake tracks everywhere.

25
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.683
we saw those same animals in the daylight,

As I walked toward the undocumented city, my reason for being there,
当我走向这个未被记录的城市，也就是我此行的目的地，

30
00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:46.138
I realized that this was the only place that I had ever been

where I didn't see a single shred of plastic.

00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:51.151
That's how remote it was.
这地方就是这么偏远。

33
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:54.024
Perhaps it's surprising to learn
知道我们的星球上

34
00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:58.879
that there are still places on our planet that are so untouched by people,
仍有一些地方没被人类踏足，也许会让人感到惊讶，

35
00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:00.149
but it's true.

36
00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:04.950
There are still hundreds of places where people haven't stepped for centuries

37
00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:06.435
or maybe forever.

38
00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:11.890
It's an awesome time to be an archaeologist.

to understand our planet like never before.

And yet, we're running out of time.

42
00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:26.573
The climate crisis threatens to destroy our ecological and cultural patrimony.

43
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.630
I feel an urgency to my work

44
00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:31.857
that I didn't feel 20 years ago.

45
00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:35.695
How can we document everything before it's too late?

46
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.430
I was trained as a traditional archaeologist

47
00:02:39.454 --> 00:02:42.760
using methodologies that have been around since the '50s.

48
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.564
That all changed in July of 2009 in Michoacán, Mexico.
这一切都在2009年7月的墨西哥米切肯州发生了变化。

49
00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:50.924
I was studying the ancient Purépecha Empire,
我正在研究古代的普雷佩查帝国，

50
00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:55.339
which is a lesser known but equally important contemporary of the Aztec.

51
00:02:55.744 --> 00:03:00.042
Two weeks earlier, my team had documented an unknown settlement,
两个星期前，我的团队记录了一个未知的定居点，

52
00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:05.992
so we were painstakingly mapping, building foundations by hand --
我们精心还原建筑物的地基，徒手操作，

53
00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.486
hundreds of them.
有好几百个之多。

54
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.999
Basic archaeological protocol is to find the edge of a settlement

55
00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:13.674
so you know what you're dealing with,
这样你就对这个定居点心里有数，

56
00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:17.036
and my graduate students convinced me to do just that.
我的研究生们就让我去做这件事。

57
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.912
So I grabbed a couple of CLIF Bars, some water, a walkie,

58
00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:23.996
and I set out alone on foot,

59
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.552
expecting to encounter "the edge" in just a few minutes.

Finally, I reached the other side of the malpais.

63
00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:38.391
Oh, there were ancient building foundations all the way across.

64
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.632
It's a city?

65
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.029
Oh, shit.
我的天啊。

66
00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:43.055
(Laughter)
真的是个城市。

67
00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.264
It's a city.
（笑声）

68
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.555
Turns out that this seemingly small settlement

73
00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:04.817
that it would take me decades to survey fully,

74
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.875
the entire rest of my career,
这几乎要贯穿我剩下的职业生涯，

75
00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:13.149

然而，我并不想在这干到退休啊，

76
00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:14.784
(Laughter)
（笑声）

77
00:04:14.808 --> 00:04:17.290
sweating, exhausted,

to feral dogs,

82
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.828
which is pointless, by the way,

00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:31.055
because Mexican dogs really don't like peanut butter.

（笑声）

Just the thought of it bored me to tears.

So I returned home to Colorado,

88
00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:45.314
"Dude, there's gotta be a better way."

91
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.746
I looked it up.

And what's more, the quality of the data

120
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.460
wasn't comparable to traditional archaeological research.

121
00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.218
It was much, much better.

122
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:17.266
I knew that this technology would change the entire field of archaeology

They failed in their quest,

but they instead documented an unknown culture, now buried under a pristine wilderness rain forest, using LiDAR.
但因为使用激光雷达，他们证实了一个被埋在原始荒野雨林下，从未有人踏足的文化。

129
00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:42.463
I agreed to help interpret their data,

00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:49.706
plastic-free and filled with curious animals.

208
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.274
so we can't measure change,
