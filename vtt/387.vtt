1
00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:17.598
What if I told you that time has a race,
若我告诉你们，时间有个种族，

2
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.956
a race in the contemporary way that we understand race in the United States?
一个我们在美国所了解与分类的种族，你们会有什么想法？

3
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.342
Typically, we talk about race in terms of black and white issues.
通常，我们谈种族时会分“黑”与“白”事件来商量。

4
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.222
In the African-American communities from which I come,
在我来自的非裔美国人社区里，

5
00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.038
we have a long-standing multi-generational joke
我们有个代代相传的笑话

6
00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:37.990
about what we call "CP time," or "colored people's time."
关于我们所称的“CP时间” 或“有色人种时间”。

7
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.360
Now, we no longer refer to African-Americans as "colored,"
虽然我们现在已不称非裔美国人为“有色人种”，

8
00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:49.890
but this long-standing joke about our perpetual lateness to church, to cookouts, to family events and even to our own funerals, remains.
但这关于我们到教堂，到聚会，到家庭活动，甚至到自己的葬礼都迟到的笑话还存在。

9
00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.750
I personally am a stickler for time.
我本身很注重时间。

10
00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:56.462
It's almost as if my mother, when I was growing up, said,
好似我在长大的时候，妈妈向我强调说：

11
00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:58.412
"We will not be those black people."
“我们不会与其他‘黑人’一样。”

12
00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.101
So we typically arrive to events 30 minutes early.
就这样，我们去哪里都通常早到三十分钟。

13
00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:06.895
But today, I want to talk to you more about the political nature of time,
可今天，我想与你们探讨的是时间的政治性质，

14
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:08.838
for if time had a race,
因为时间若有个种族，

15
00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:10.200
it would be white.
那时间肯定是白色人种。

16
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:13.147
White people own time.
白色人种是时间的主人。

17
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.859
I know, I know.
我知道，我知道。

18
00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:19.755
Making such "incendiary statements" makes us uncomfortable:
这些“挑衅的陈述”会让我们不舒服。

19
00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.171
Haven't we moved past the point where race really matters?
我们不早已化解了种族的区分了吗？

20
00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.282
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?
种族毕竟是个粗鲁的概念，

21
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.496
Shouldn't we go ahead with our enlightened, progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history?
而明智，英明的我们，是不是应该把种族这类无用的概念给丢掉呢？

22
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.592
How will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race?
若我们一直谈种族，我们怎能希望克服种族主义呢？

23
00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.842
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule, bury them
也许我们得把所拥有的种族概念放进时间胶囊里，把它埋葬。

24
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:50.520
and dig them up in a thousand years, peer at them with the clearly more enlightened,
等到一千年后，当我们变得更开明，

25
00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:53.535
raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future.
当我们不再以种族分类时，再研究我们对种族所有的概念。

26
00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:55.611
But you see there,
但你们看，

27
00:01:55.635 --> 00:02:00.226
that desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up
减轻种族主义的影响是由我们

28
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.564
in how we attempt to manage time,
如何管理时间,

29
00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.648
in the ways we narrate history,
如何叙述历史，

30
00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:09.000
in the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present into the past,
如何把消极的真相埋进历史，

31
00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:11.044
in the ways we attempt to argue that the future that we hope for
如何议论证明理想的未来

32
00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:13.937
is the present in which we're currently living.
是我们现在所居住的世界，所看得出的。

33
00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.351
Now, when Barack Obama became President of the US in 2008,
当贝拉克·奥巴马在2008年担任美国总统时，

34
00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.365
many Americans declared that we were post-racial.
美国人大部分宣布美国以克服了种族观念。

35
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.904
I'm from the academy where we're enamored with being post-everything.
我来自的学派迷恋着什么东西都得加个“后”。

36
00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:30.446
We're postmodern, we're post-structural, we're post-feminist.
我们是后现代，后结构，后女权主义者。

37
00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.625
"Post" has become a simple academic appendage
“后”这个字以成为了一个简单的字首。

38
00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.227
that we apply to a range of terms to mark the way we were.
所有个“后”字的词代表了我们之前的状况。

39
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:44.091
But prefixes alone don't have the power to make race and racism a thing of the past.
可单单一个字首是没有能够把种族概念与种族主义完全消失的能力。

40
00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.077
The US was never "pre-race."
美国向来就有种族观念。

41
00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.650
So to claim that we're post-race when we have yet to grapple with the impact
因此，当我们还没完全了解到种族区分

42
00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:55.292
of race on black people, Latinos or the indigenous is disingenuous.
在黑人，拉丁美洲人，和土著的影响，要宣称自己已成为了一个“后种族概念”的社会可不诚实。

43
00:02:55.902 --> 00:03:00.166
Just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate our post-racial future,
就当我们准备庆祝我们“后种族概念”的未来，

44
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.511
our political conditions became the most racial they've been in the last 50 years.
我们的政治环境是近50年最关注种族的政治环境。

45
00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:12.192
So today, I want to offer to you three observations, about the past, the present and the future of time,
所以今天，我想把关于时间的过去，现在，与未来的三个观察与你们分享，

46
00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:16.335
as it relates to the combating of racism and white dominance.
因为它对克服白色主义与种族主义有个联系。

47
00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:18.797
First: the past.
首先，谈过去。

48
00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:21.509
Time has a history,
时间有个历史，

49
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.500
and so do black people.
黑人也有个历史。

50
00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:26.190
But we treat time as though it is timeless,
但我们把时间当成永恒，

51
00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:28.618
as though it has always been this way,
好似一向来都是这样，

52
00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:30.931
as though it doesn't have a political history
好似它与

53
00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.165
bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands,
土著的土地掠夺，

54
00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.742
the genocide of indigenous people
土著的种族灭绝

55
00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:37.812
and the stealing of Africans from their homeland.
与非洲人的家园被偷走无关。

56
00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.678
When white male European philosophers
当欧洲白种男性思想家

57
00:03:40.702 --> 00:03:45.702
first thought to conceptualize time and history, one famously declared,
起初想到把时间与历史概念化，其中一个宣布：

58
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.269
"[Africa] is no historical part of the World."
“非洲在世界历史上没位子。”

59
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.255
He was essentially saying that Africans were people outside of history
他的含义是非洲人在历史没部分，

60
00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.765
who had had no impact on time
对时间没影响，

61
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:58.438
or the march of progress.
对进展没贡献。

62
00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:06.864
This idea, that black people have had no impact on history, is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy.
这“黑人对历史没影响”的想法是白色至上的基本思想之一。

63
00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:11.722
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson created "Negro History Week" in 1926.
也是卡特·伍德森在1926年创造“黑人历史周”的原因。

64
00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:17.453
It's the reason that we continue to celebrate Black History Month in the US every February.
也是我们在美国每二月份庆祝“黑人历史月”的原因。

65
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.950
Now, we also see this idea
我们也看得出一种概念说

66
00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:25.497
that black people are people either alternately outside of the bounds of time
黑人只能在时间的边界外面

67
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:27.029
or stuck in the past,
或被卡在过去的概念，

68
00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:29.928
in a scenario where, much as I'm doing right now,
在一个好似现在的情形，

69
00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:34.078
a black person stands up and insists that racism still matters,
有个黑人站起来，坚持种族主义值得我们的关注，

70
00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:37.618
and a person, usually white, says to them,
而有个人，通常一个白人问他：

71
00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:39.206
"Why are you stuck in the past?
“你们为什么还卡在过去的概念？”

72
00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:41.079
Why can't you move on?
“为何不能走向未来？

73
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.811
We have a black president.
我们已经有个黑人总统，

74
00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.261
We're past all that."
很明显看得出我们早已克服了种族主义。”

75
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.780
William Faulkner famously said,
威廉·福克納曾经说过，

76
00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:52.435
"The past is never dead. It's not even past."
“历史不是死的。历史根本还没过去。”

77
00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:56.905
But my good friend Professor Kristie Dotson says,
但我好朋友克莉斯蒂·多森教授说

78
00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:00.178
"Our memory is longer than our lifespan."
“我们的记忆比我们的寿命长。”

79
00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:07.051
We carry, all of us, family and communal hopes and dreams with us.
我们都背着家庭与社区的希望与梦想。

80
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.782
We don't have the luxury of letting go of the past.
我们没法放下过去。

81
00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:15.725
But sometimes,
可有时，

82
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.734
our political conditions are so troubling
我们的政治状态让人忧虑，

83
00:05:17.758 --> 00:05:19.947
that we don't know if we're living in the past
让我们不知道现在是活在过去

84
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:22.064
or we're living in the present.
还是活在现在。

85
00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:24.763
Take, for instance, when Black Lives Matter protesters
比如所，当“黑人的命也是命”抗议者

86
00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:28.808
go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police,
出去抗议警方不公正的杀死黑人公民，

87
00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:34.520
and the pictures that emerge from the protest look like they could have been taken 50 years ago.
所拍出来的照片好似有可能是在五十年前拍的。

88
00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:37.813
The past won't let us go.
历史可不放过我们。

89
00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:42.467
But still, let us press our way into the present.
研究了历史，就得看看现在的情况。

90
00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:51.251
At present, I would argue that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time and space.
我认为当今所经验的种族挣扎是关于时间与空间的挣扎。

91
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:53.390
What do I mean?
这是什么意思呢？

92
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.039
Well, I've already told you that white people own time.
我已告诉你们白人是时间的主人。

93
00:05:57.662 --> 00:06:00.737
Those in power dictate the pace of the workday.
他们有权控制工作日的步伐，

94
00:06:01.413 --> 00:06:04.802
They dictate how much money our time is actually worth.
有权控制时间与金钱的价值。

95
00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:07.935
And Professor George Lipsitz argues
而乔治·利比茨教授认为

96
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.870
that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion.
白人甚至有控制社会包容步伐的权利。

97
00:06:11.894 --> 00:06:18.658
They dictate how long it will actually take for minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for.
他们控制少数种族需要多长的时间才能得到所争取的基本权利。

98
00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:21.993
Let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example.
让我很快地从历史中举个列子。

99
00:06:22.921 --> 00:06:28.021
If you think about the Civil Rights Movement and the cries of its leaders for "Freedom Now,"
若你们想想看，人民权利运动领导“自由”的喊叫

100
00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:31.414
they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion.
是挑战白人社会包容的慢步伐。

101
00:06:32.137 --> 00:06:36.165
By 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act was passed,
1965年，投票权法案终于被执行，

102
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.686
there had been a full 100 years between the end of the Civil War
非裔美国人得到了投票的权利，

103
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.856
and the conferral of voting rights on African-American communities.
可这个时刻离南北战争已经有整整一百年。

104
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.095
Despite the urgency of a war,
虽然社会的分裂是导致战争的主要原因之一，

105
00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.466
it still took a full 100 years for actual social inclusion to occur.
但却需要了整整一百年才得到所欲求的社会包容。

106
00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:52.253
Since 2012,
而自2012年，

107
00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:55.954
conservative state legislatures across the US have ramped up attempts
美国保守州的立法团体设法

108
00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:58.167
to roll back African-American voting rights
去掉非裔美国人的投票权利。

109
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.666
by passing restrictive voter ID laws
他们执行限制性的选民法律，

110
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.255
and curtailing early voting opportunities.
缩短早期投票的机会。

111
00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:07.622
This past July, a federal court struck down North Carolina's voter ID law
去年七月份，联邦法庭驳回了北卡罗来纳的选民法律，

112
00:07:07.646 --> 00:07:12.819
saying it "... targeted African-Americans with surgical precision."
说所执行的法律“特地对准非裔美国人，”

113
00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:17.837
Restricting African-American inclusion in the body politic
限制非裔美国人的融入

114
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:25.396
is a primary way that we attempt to manage and control people by managing and controlling time.
是我们管理与控制时间与人的主要方式。

115
00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:33.068
But another place that we see these time-space clashes is in gentrifying cities like Atlanta, Brooklyn,
但有我们也在如亚特兰大，布鲁克林里

116
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.068
Philadelphia, New Orleans and Washington, DC --
费城，新奥尔良和华盛顿特区

117
00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:40.207
places that have had black populations for generations.
这些住着代代黑人的城市里见证了同类的时间-空间的挣扎。

118
00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:43.523
But now, in the name of urban renewal and progress,
可现在，以城市化与进展之名，

119
00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:48.152
these communities are pushed out, in service of bringing them into the 21st century.
以“把他们带进21世纪”的理由，黑人渐渐被推出他们所居住的地方。

120
00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:51.972
Professor Sharon Holland asked:
雪伦·荷兰教授问道：

121
00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:55.663
What happens when a person who exists in time
当一个只存在时间的人遇到一个只存在空间的人

122
00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:59.114
meets someone who only occupies space?
会发生什么事？

123
00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:02.312
These racial struggles
这些种族挣扎

124
00:08:02.336 --> 00:08:05.916
are battles over those who are perceived to be space-takers
都是被视为空间占位者的人与

125
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.861
and those who are perceived to be world-makers.
被视为世界创作者的人的战争。

126
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:12.850
Those who control the flow and thrust of history
控制历史走向的人，

127
00:08:12.874 --> 00:08:16.447
are considered world-makers who own and master time.
被视为时间的主人，世界的创造者。

128
00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:19.310
In other words: white people.
换句话来讲：这些人是白人。

129
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.195
But when Hegel famously said that Africa was no historical part of the world,
但当黑格尔著名的说非洲不属于世界的历史，

130
00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:26.724
he implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass
他默示非洲只是片体积大的土地

131
00:08:26.748 --> 00:08:28.869
taking up space at the bottom of the globe.
在地球的底部占位子。

132
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.822
Africans were space-takers.
默示非洲人是空间占位者。

133
00:08:32.348 --> 00:08:36.631
So today, white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history,
因此今天白人继续控制时间的走向，

134
00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:41.198
