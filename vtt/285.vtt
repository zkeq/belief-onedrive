用在我的书里，

139
00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.996
and on appearances on places like CBS and NPR,
哥伦比亚广播公司和国家公共广播电台也用过这些数据，

140
00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:32.903
they were offered that opportunity again
他们再次获得了反驳的机会，

141
00:06:32.903 --> 00:06:35.153
to say, "Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong."
大可以说，“特雷弗·阿伦森在胡扯。”

142
00:06:35.153 --> 00:06:37.013
And they've never come forward and said,
但他们从来没有站出来说，

143
00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:38.634
"These are the problems with those findings."
“这些事并不属实。”

144
00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:42.275
So the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch
所以这些数据最近被“人权观察”组织

145
00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:44.977
on its recent report on  these types of sting operations.
用在他们关于此类虚假行动的调查报告中。

146
00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:47.616
And so far, the FBI has never  really responded
到目前为止，联邦调查局从未正式回应

147
00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:50.842
to these charges that it's really not catching terrorists
上述指控：他们逮捕的不是恐怖分子，

148
00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:52.987
so much as it's catching mentally ill people
只是些精神病人

149
00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:56.349
that it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations.
被伪装成恐怖分子，上演了一出虚假反恐的戏码。

150
00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.147
TR: So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website,
TR：“拦截”是一家新的进行新闻调查的网站，

151
00:07:01.147 --> 00:07:02.915
that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.
由格伦·格林沃尔德等人联合创建。

152
00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:06.494
Tell us about your article  and why there.
跟我们讲讲你的文章，为什么发表在他们网站。

153
00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:09.474
TA: The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this
TA：“拦截”是最适合发表的地方，

154
00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:12.543
because my article is  really leveraging the fact that
因为我的文章揭露了一个事实，

155
00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:15.028
a source had leaked to me transcripts of these
消息人士提供给我的录音文本

156
00:07:15.028 --> 00:07:17.975
private FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed
是联邦调查局的私密对话，

157
00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:20.376
based on the government's claim  that their release
联邦法官将其封存，因为政府认为一旦泄露，

158
00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:22.568
would irreparably damage  the U.S. government's
将对美国政府的执法战略

159
00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:24.672
law enforcement strategy.
带来无法弥补的损失。

160
00:07:24.672 --> 00:07:27.651
So a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists
所以像“拦截”这样的网站就建立起来了，用来保护记者

161
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:28.710
and publish their work
并发表他们的文章，

162
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.539
when they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this.
尤其当记者在报道如此敏感的事件的时候。

163
00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.438
So my story in The Intercept,  which was just published today,
所以我的文章，今天刚刚在“拦截”上面刊登，

164
00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:37.773
tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting
讲述了萨米·奥斯马卡什如何被联邦调查局设计陷害，

165
00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:39.453
and goes into much greater detail.
并挖掘了一些更深的细节。

166
00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:42.417
In this talk, I could only highlight the things that they said,
在本次演讲中，我只强调了他们所说的部分内容，

167
00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:44.254
such as calling him a "retarded fool."
比如称他为“弱智傻瓜”。

168
00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:45.736
But it was much more elaborate,
但这更是个精心策划的阴谋，

169
00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:48.832
they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,
他们计划周详，为萨米·奥斯马卡什提供资金，

170
00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:51.888
which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent.
他随后又从卧底探员手中购买武器。

171
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.028
When he went to trial,
当他接受审判时，

172
00:07:53.028 --> 00:07:56.159
the central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons,
他购买武器的行为成为了最关键的证据，

173
00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.080
when in truth, these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated
但这些录音文本揭露了真相，联邦调查局精心策划，

174
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.480
someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke
为这些精神病人和破产者提供资金，

175
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.699
to get money to then  pay for weapons
让他们购买武器，

176
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:06.207
that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for.
随后再起诉他们意图不轨。

177
00:08:06.207 --> 00:08:08.334
TR: One final question.
TR：最后一个问题。

178
00:08:08.334 --> 00:08:09.855
Less than 10 days ago,
不到十天前，

179
00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:13.007
the FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,
联邦调查局在布鲁克林逮捕了一些“伊拉克和沙姆伊斯兰国”的嫌疑人，

180
00:08:13.007 --> 00:08:16.535
saying that they might be headed to Syria,
称他们可能会前往叙利亚，

181
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:19.442
and were those real, or examples of more of the same?
这件事是真的吗？还是同样只是演戏。

182
00:08:19.442 --> 00:08:22.456
TA: Well so far, we only know what's come out in the court file,
TA：到目前为止，我们所知事实都来源于法庭文件，

183
00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:24.811
but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same.
但在我看来这又是一场戏。

184
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:28.753
These types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor.
这种虚假反恐行动总是紧跟潮流，

185
00:08:28.643 --> 00:08:30.811
So initially it was al Qaeda plots,
起初“基地组织”戏份最多，

186
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.125
and now the Islamic State is the current flavor.
现在“伊斯兰国”成了他们的最爱。

187
00:08:32.485 --> 00:08:35.934
What's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged
这个案子值得注意的是，被指控的三名男子，

188
00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:38.544
only began the plot to go to Syria
都是在与联邦调查局的线人接触后，

189
00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:40.621
after the introduction of the FBI informant,
才开始密谋要前往叙利亚，

190
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:44.987
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed.
而实际上，他们的旅行证件都是联邦调查局的线人帮他们办理的。

191
00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:47.604
In kind of a comical turn  in that particular case,
最为搞笑的一个转折就是，

192
00:08:47.604 --> 00:08:49.670
one of the defendant's mother had found out
其中一名被告的母亲

193
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.836
that he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport.
在发现儿子要前往叙利亚后就把他的护照给藏起来了。

194
00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:55.769
So it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport,
所以即使他能成功抵达机场，

195
00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:56.747
that he ever could have gone anywhere.
恐怕也哪儿都去不了。

196
00:08:56.747 --> 00:09:00.098
So yes, there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State in the United States,
的确，在美国也许会有人对加入“伊斯兰国”感兴趣，

197
00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:02.855
and those are people that the United  States government should be looking at
这部分人才是美国政府应该关注的，

198
00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:04.372
to see if they're interested in violence here.
看他们是不是有暴力倾向。

199
00:09:04.373 --> 00:09:07.295
In this particular case, given the evidence that's so far come out,
而在这件案子中，就目前所掌握的证据而言，

200
00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:10.484
it suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys
正是联邦调查局让这些人

201
00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.932
to move along in a plan to go to Syria
产生了去叙利亚的想法，

202
00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:15.076
when they were never close  to that in the first place.
而之前他们可能连想都没想过。

203
00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:17.377
TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing. TA: Thank you.
TR：非常感谢，很棒的演讲。TA：谢谢你。

204
00:09:17.377 --> 00:09:20.612
