the world's population is living without real access to arts and culture.

I just want to take care of a few housekeeping points.

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:50.819
First, I am no expert in art or culture.

I think it gets a bit boring.

For example, this month, we launched the "Black History" channel

which actually is the idea of my talk,

00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.234
is -- I didn't expect to become a fan of Japanese dolls.

00:01:57.258 --> 00:02:00.422
But I am, thanks to this exhibition,

00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:25.439
One of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York,
我们最近的一个想法之一是和纽约的古根海姆博物馆合作

42
00:02:25.463 --> 00:02:29.996
where you can get a taste of what it might feel like to actually be there.

45
00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:37.261
And you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is.
你可以亲眼目睹这个建筑巨作

46
00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:40.379

who hasn't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.053
you can obviously get into them and so on and so forth.

51
00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:52.952
There's a lot of information here.

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:56.825
But this is not the purpose of my talk today.

when it comes to arts and culture and accessibility to arts and culture.

This object you see behind me -- oh, just clarification:

Always, seeing the real thing is better.

and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang?

What might that look like?

over six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions,

you can understand more about our society through these.

if we just organized art and culture.

We can also then plot it by time,

85
00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.999
which obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating.

86
00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:40.409
You can spend hours looking at every decade

but we don't have the time right now.

00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:10.618
you can move on from here to another very interesting idea.
从这里你可以继续另一个很有趣的想法

97
00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.353

what is the purpose, how is this useful?
我们想要达到什么目的？怎样让这个平台更有实用性？

100
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:22.929
This next idea comes from discussions with curators that we've been having at museums,
下一个想法来源于我们在博物馆时与博物馆策展人们的对话

101
00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:24.976
who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,
顺便说一句，我也很爱他们

102
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.194
because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories.
因为他们的一生都致力于讲述这些故事

103
00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:31.149
One of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like
其中一位博物馆策展人告诉我：“阿米特，如果可以做个策展人的虚拟桌面

104
00:05:31.173 --> 00:05:33.652
if you could create a virtual curator's table
让六百万展品可以以一个我们可以

105
00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:40.406
where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?"
看得见其中的联系的方式展现给大家那该多好。”

106
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.459
You can spend a lot of time, trust me, looking at different objects
你可以花上很长时间观赏不同的展品

107
00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:46.436
and understanding where they come from.

108
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.668
It's a crazy Matrix experience.
就像《黑客帝国》里的经历一样

109
00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:49.706
(Laughter)
（观众笑声）

110
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.016
Just moving on,
我们继续

111
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.211
let's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh,

who is very well-represented on this platform.

now organized in one beautiful view.
有组织地排成一幅美丽景观

116
00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:13.246
And as it resolves, and as Cyril goes deeper,

you can see still life.

00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:19.555

I think only for the second time ever.

129
00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:44.625
in a very different way,
任何人都可以用这种不同寻常的方式观看

130
00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.682
and you won't get pushed in the line in the crowd.
而且你不用担心排队观看时的拥挤

131
00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:52.448
So let's take you and let's travel through "The Bedroom" very quickly,

132
00:06:52.472 --> 00:06:56.059
so you can experience what we are doing for every single object.
你们可以感受我们在每一幅作品上所做的努力

We want the image to speak as much as it can on a digital platform.
我们希望这幅图片可以在一个数字平台上最大化地讲述它的故事

And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.

143
00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:32.469
to an artwork or to a museum or to a cultural discovery.
参观一座博物馆或进行一次文化之旅

144
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:35.235
So for me, personally, it was quite a challenge
所以，对于我来说这确实是一个挑战

145
00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.481
because when I decided to make this my full-time job at Google,
因为当我决定在谷歌全职从事这个工作的时候

146
00:07:38.505 --> 00:07:41.108
my mother was not very supportive.
我妈妈并不是很支持

147
00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:42.379
I love my mother,
我爱我的妈妈

148
00:07:42.403 --> 00:07:45.402
but she thought I was wasting my life with this museum stuff.
但是她认为我从事博物馆相关的工作是在浪费生命

149
00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:48.738
And for her, a museum is what you do when you go on vacation
对于她来说参观博物馆是放假时做的事

150
00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:50.729
and you tick-mark and it's over, right?
打一下卡就结束了

151
00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:53.284
And it took around four and a half years
我用了大概四年半的时间

152
00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:55.522
for me to convince my lovely Indian mother
说服我可爱的印度妈妈

153
00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:57.199
that actually, this is worthwhile.
告诉她我所做的是值得的

154
00:07:57.223 --> 00:08:00.664
And the way I did it was, I realized one day that she loves gold.
我用的办法是有一天我发现她喜欢黄金

155
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:06.263
So I started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them.
我开始给她展示所有有黄金作为材料的作品

156
00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:08.938
And the first thing my mom asks me is,
我妈妈问我的第一句话是：

157
00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:11.390
"How can we buy these?"
“我们怎么买这些东西？”

158
00:08:11.414 --> 00:08:13.232
(Laughter)
（观众笑声）

159
00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:16.398
And obviously, my salary is not that high,
显然我的工资没有那么高

160
00:08:16.422 --> 00:08:18.800
so I was like, "We can't actually do that, mom.
所以，我说：“妈妈我们买不了

161
00:08:18.824 --> 00:08:20.935
But you can explore them virtually."
但是你可以虚拟地探索它们。”

162
00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:24.378
And so now my mom -- every time I meet her, she asks me,
所以现在当我每次遇见妈妈她都会问我：

163
00:08:24.402 --> 00:08:27.868
"Any more gold, any more silver in your project? Can you show me?"
“你的项目里还有别的金银做的物品么？能给我看看么？“

164
00:08:27.892 --> 00:08:30.066
And that's the idea I'm trying to illustrate.
这就是我想解释的观点

165
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.228
It does not matter how you get in,
你怎么接触这些艺术品并不重要

166
00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:33.614
as long as you get in.
只要你接触了这些艺术品

167
00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.248
Once you get in, you're hooked.
只要你开始了解你就会被吸引

168
00:08:35.272 --> 00:08:37.621
Moving on from here very quickly,
说完这个

169
00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:40.494
there is kind of a playful idea, actually,
其实我想讲一个很好玩的观点

170
00:08:40.518 --> 00:08:42.153
to illustrate the point of access,
从实用的角度出发

171
00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:44.599
and I'm going to go quite quickly on this one.
简明地阐述我的观点

172
00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:50.030
We all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing.
我们都知道亲自去看这些艺术作品是很棒的

173
00:08:50.054 --> 00:08:52.637
But we also know that most of us can't do it,
但是我们也知道我们中的大部分没有办法去

174
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:55.419
and the ones that can afford to do it, it's complicated.
我们承担不起费用这很复杂

175
00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:59.250
So -- Cyril, can we load up our art trip, what do we call it?
所以－西里尔，我们可不可以加载我们的艺术之旅

176
00:08:59.274 --> 00:09:01.036
We don't have a good name for this.
我们还不知道怎么称呼这个

177
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:07.222
But essentially, we have around 1,000 amazing institutions, 68 countries.
但是本质上，我们的平台上有来自68个国家的 1000个伟大的机构

178
00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.946
But let's start with Rembrandt.
我们从伦勃朗的作品开始

179
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.212
We might have time for only one example.
我们也许只有举一个例子的时间

180
00:09:11.236 --> 00:09:13.465
But thanks to the diversity,
但是感谢组织的多样性

181
00:09:13.489 --> 00:09:19.686
we've got around 500 amazing Rembrandt object artworks from 46 institutions and 17 countries.
我们收集了来自17个国家46个组织的500件左右伟大的伯伦朗艺术品

182
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.262
Let's say that on your next vacation,
假如在你的下一个假期

183
00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:24.336
you want to go see every single one of them.
你想观看每一个艺术品

184
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.694
That is your itinerary,
这是你的行程安排

185
00:09:25.718 --> 00:09:29.372
you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers,
你大概要完成53000公里

186
00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:31.983
visit around, I think, 46 institutions,
穿越46个机构的旅程

187
00:09:32.007 --> 00:09:36.198
and just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions.
仅供参考您可能会释放10吨二氧化碳

188
00:09:36.222 --> 00:09:37.685
(Laughter)
（观众笑声）

189
00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:39.182
But remember, it's art,
但是请记住，这是艺术

190
00:09:39.206 --> 00:09:41.871
so you can justify it, perhaps, in some way.
所以从某种角度说这样做也说得过去

191
00:09:42.657 --> 00:09:44.579
Moving on swiftly from here,
继续下一个话题

192
00:09:44.603 --> 00:09:47.538
is something a little bit more technical and more interesting.
这个话题更专业也更有趣

193
00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:52.499
All that we've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections.
目前我们展示的是利用元数据产生联系

194
00:09:52.523 --> 00:09:54.633
But obviously we have something cool nowadays
但是显然，我们现在有很棒的东西－－计算机学习能力

195
00:09:54.657 --> 00:09:57.569
that everyone likes to talk about, which is machine learning.
所有人都喜欢讨论这个领域

196
00:09:57.593 --> 00:10:00.667
So what we thought is, let's strip out all the metadata,
所以，我们的想法是让我们跳出元数据

197
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:08.650
let's look at what machine learning can do based purely on visual recognition of this entire collection.
看一看仅仅依靠视觉识别这个全部的收集的计算机学习能力可以做什么

198
00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:12.867
What we ended up with is this very interesting map,
我们创造了这个非常有趣的地图

199
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.201
these clusters that have no reference point information,
这些集群没有参考点信息

200
00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:21.190
but has just used visuals to cluster things together.
仅仅依靠外观联系在一起

201
00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:24.796
Each cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery.
每一个集群对我们来说本身就是一次发现

202
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.483
But one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly
其中我们想展示给大家的

203
00:10:27.507 --> 00:10:32.585
is this amazing cluster of portraits that we found from museums around the world.
一个集群是全世界博物馆中精彩的的肖像集群

204
00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:34.792
If you could zoom in a little bit more, Cyril.
西里尔，如果可以放大一点

205
00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:38.648
Just to show you, you can just travel through portraits.
如各位所见你可以在肖像中徜徉

206
00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:43.226
And essentially, you can do nature, you can do horses and clusters galore.
而且你可以寻找与自然相关或与马相关的这里有大量的集群

207
00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:45.677
When we saw all these portraits,
我们看着这些肖像

208
00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:49.353
we were like, "Hey, can we do something fun for kids,
我们在想：“我们可不可以为孩子带来一些快乐？

209
00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:51.059
or can we do something playful
或者可不可以做一些好玩的东西

210
00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:53.108
to get people interested in portraits?"
让人们对画像更有兴趣？”

211
00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:55.312
Because I haven't really seen
因为我没真正见过

212
00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:58.703
young kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery.
去肖像美术馆很兴奋的孩子

213
00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:01.109
I wanted to try to figure something out.
我们想创造点什么

214
00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:03.600
So we created something called the portrait matcher.
所以我们开发了肖像比对功能

215
00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:04.941
It's quite self-explanatory,
这个功能很好理解

216
00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:07.703
so I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face.
我只需要西里尔展示一下他美丽的脸

217
00:11:07.727 --> 00:11:11.859
And essentially what's happening is, with the movement of his head,
随着他头部的运动

218
00:11:11.883 --> 00:11:16.050
we are matching different portraits around the world from museums.
世界各地博物馆的画像可以与之匹配

219
00:11:16.074 --> 00:11:18.270
(Applause)
（观众掌声）

220
00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:30.971
And I don't know about you,
我不知道各位感觉如何

221
00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:33.011
but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,
当我给我的外甥和妹妹演示的时候

222
00:11:33.035 --> 00:11:34.884
and the reaction is just phenomenal.
他们开心得不行

223
00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:37.614
All they ask me is, "When can we go see this?"
他们都在问我：“什么时候我们可以玩这个？”

224
00:11:39.312 --> 00:11:40.885
And by the way, if we're nice,
顺便提一句如果我们做个好人

225
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.730
maybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one?
西里尔，你可以笑一下找一张开心点的么？

226
00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:45.914
Oh, perfect.
噢，太完美了

227
00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.926
By the way, this is not rehearsed.
我们事先没有彩排过

228
00:11:48.294 --> 00:11:50.874
Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.
恭喜你西里尔干得不错

229
00:11:50.898 --> 00:11:54.374
OK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time.
我们继续不然这个应用可以玩一天

230
00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:56.116
(Applause)
（观众掌声）

231
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.720
So, art and culture can be fun also, right?
所以艺术和文化也很有意思，是吧？

232
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.117
For our last quick experiment --
最后一个小实验

233
00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:04.904
we call all of these "experiments" --
我们管这些叫做“实验”

234
00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:07.817
our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning.
最后一个实验回到了计算机学习部分

235
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:10.682
We show you clusters, visual clusters,
我们展示了集群视觉集群

236
00:12:10.706 --> 00:12:15.607
but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters?
如果我们让电脑命名这些集群会发生什么？

237
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:20.384
What if it could automatically tag them, using no actual metadata?
不使用元数据的情况下电脑可以自动为集群打上标签么？

238
00:12:20.408 --> 00:12:24.508
So what we have is this kind of explorer,
所以我们有了这样一个浏览器

239
00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:28.143
where we have managed to match, I think, around 4,000 labels.
电脑为我们做了4000个标签

240
00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:31.331
And we haven't really done anything special here,
我们其实没有做什么特别的

241
00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:33.013
just fed the collection.
只是提供了所有的收藏

242
00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:34.807
And we found interesting categories.
我们发现了很多有趣的分类

243
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:37.736
We can start with horses, a very straightforward category.
我们可以从马开始这是很直接的分类

244
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.824
You would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses, right?
你可以期待看到电脑放进去的都是马的照片，对吧？

245
00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:45.290
And it has, but you also notice, right over there,
当然有，但是如果仔细看这边

246
00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:47.393
that it has a very abstract image
这里有一个非常抽象的图

247
00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:50.612
that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses.
电脑认定也属于马的分类

248
00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:54.326
We also have an amazing head in terms of a horse.
这样我们就以马为关键字有了漂亮的一拍图片

249
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.352
And each one has the tags as to why it got categorized in this.
每一个图片都有标签说明为什么它被这样分类

250
00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:02.350
So let's move to another one which I found very funny and interesting,
那么我们继续看一个我觉得很有趣的例子

251
00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:04.865
because I don't understand how this category came up.
因为我不知道这个分类怎么来的

252
00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:06.639
It's called "Lady in Waiting."
分类叫做“等待的女人”

253
00:13:06.663 --> 00:13:09.275
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,
西里尔请加快速度

254
00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:12.841
you will see that we have these amazing images
你们可以看到这些精彩的图片

255
00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:15.626
of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.
都是关于在等待或在摆姿势的女人的

256
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.096
I don't really understand it.
我确实无法理解

257
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.360
But I've been trying to ask my museum contacts,
但是我一直在尝试问我的博物馆联系人

258
00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:21.629
you know, "What is this? What's going on here?"
“这是什么？这张图里发生了什么？”

259
00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:23.265
And it's fascinating.
这确实让人着迷

260
00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:25.978
Coming back to gold very quickly,
回到金子

261
00:13:26.002 --> 00:13:27.565
I wanted to search for gold
我想要寻找金子

262
00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:29.691
and see how the machine tagged all the gold.
然后看看电脑如何给金子打上标签

263
00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:31.795
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.
但是实际上电脑没有给它标签黄金

264
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.655
We are living in popular times.
我们生活在一个流行的时代

265
00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.782
It tags it as "bling-bling."
它打的标签是“土豪金”

266
00:13:35.806 --> 00:13:37.620
(Laughter)
（观众笑声）

267
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.941
I'm being hard on Cyril, because I'm moving too fast.
我一直在难为西里尔因为我讲的太快了

268
00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:47.777
Essentially, here you have all the bling-bling of the world's museums organized for you.
现在你可以看到世界上的博物馆为您提供的所有土豪金的物品

269
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:51.317
And finally, to end this talk and these experiments,
最后，希望各位在听完这次演讲后

270
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:54.658
what I hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion.
可以感到开心和感动

271
00:13:54.682 --> 00:13:57.121
And what would we see when we see happiness?
然后当我们感到高兴的时候我们会看到什么？

272
00:13:57.145 --> 00:14:00.304
If we actually look at all the objects
如果我们看完这些

273
00:14:00.328 --> 00:14:02.272
that have been tagged under "happiness,"
被打上“快乐”的艺术品

274
00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:05.360
you would expect happiness, I guess.
我想你们会感到快乐

275
00:14:05.384 --> 00:14:11.487
But there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting,
但是有一个作品很吸引人很有趣

276
00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:15.886
which was this artwork by Douglas Coupland,
由我们的朋友，也是当地艺术家

277
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.005
our friend and artist in residence as well,
道格拉斯·库普兰所做

278
00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:20.290
called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."
叫做，“我怀念有网络前的大脑”

279
00:14:20.314 --> 00:14:23.929
I don't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre-Internet brain
我不知道为什么计算机会想念有网络前的大脑

280
00:14:23.953 --> 00:14:25.223
and it's been tagged here,
也不知道为什么这部作品被标记在这里

281
00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:27.161
but it's a very interesting thought.
但是这个想法很有意思

282
00:14:27.185 --> 00:14:29.368
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,
有的时候我确实很怀念我有网络之前的大脑

283
00:14:29.392 --> 00:14:32.392
but not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online.
但是当我开始在网上探索艺术和文化之后我就不这么想了

284
00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:34.729
So take out your phones, take out your computers,
所以，拿出你的手机和电脑

285
00:14:34.753 --> 00:14:35.910
go visit museums.
去参观博物馆吧

286
00:14:35.934 --> 00:14:38.613
And just a quick call-out to all the amazing archivists,
这就像那些坐在博物馆中保存这些历史的博物馆馆长

287
00:14:38.637 --> 00:14:40.021
historians, curators,
策展人或历史学家

288
00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.817
who are sitting in museums, preserving all this culture.
为您上门服务

289
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:47.514
And the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture for ourselves and our kids.
至少我们可以让我们和我们的后代每天增长一点艺术文化知识

290
00:14:47.538 --> 00:14:48.691
Thank you.
谢谢

291
00:14:48.715 --> 00:14:59.356
