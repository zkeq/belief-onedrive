00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Four years ago, on the TED stage,
四年前，

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.397
I announced a company I was working with at the time
我在TED上，介绍了当时工作的公司

3
00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:19.306
called Odeo.
Odeo。

4
00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:20.984
And because of that announcement,
由于那次演讲，

5
00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:23.045
we got a big article in The New York Times,
纽约时报为我们写了一大篇文章，

6
00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:26.323
which led to more press, which led to more attention,
然后它又带来了更多媒体的报道，吸引了更多关注。

7
00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:29.000
and me deciding to become CEO of that company --
之后我决定要当这家公司的CEO——

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
whereas I was just an adviser --
那之前我只是个顾问——

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.353
and raising a round of venture capital
并成功获得风险投资

10
00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:35.000
and ramping up hiring.
同时招聘更多人才。

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.846
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,
我招了一名叫Jack Dorsey的工程师，

12
00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:42.783
and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,
当一年后我们商量Odeo的发展方向时，

13
00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:47.445
Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years
Jack提出了一个他捉摸了好几年的点子

14
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:51.000
that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.
基本上就是个能向朋友们发送简单消息的想法。

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.246
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,
Odeo当时也在探索短信服务，

16
00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:55.091
so we kind of put two and two together,
所以我们差不多是想将他们两结合在一起。

17
00:00:55.091 --> 00:01:00.045
and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.
2006年初，作为Odeo的一个业余项目，Twitter项目开始进行。

18
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.523
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project
现在很难说搞业余项目是不是个好主意，

19
00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:04.876
at a startup, where focus is so critical,
因为对于初创型企业，专注是至关重要的。

20
00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:07.215
but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project
但事实上，我在前一家公司推出的Blogger服务，

21
00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:08.538
to my previous company,
也是一个业余项目。

22
00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:11.000
thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,
我当时想这只不过是个随便搞一下的小玩意。

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.599
and it ended up taking over not only the company,
结果它不但占据了整个公司

24
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:16.000
but my life for the next five or six years.
也占据了我之后五、六年的生活。

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.337
So I learned to follow hunches
从中我学会了跟随直觉，

26
00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:20.200
even though you can't necessarily justify them
尽管你不知道它是否正确，

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.629
or know where they're going to go.
也不知道它会发展成什么样子。

28
00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:25.000
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.
这种情况又一次发生在了Twitter身上。

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, for those of you unfamiliar,
那么，对于那些不熟悉Twitter的人，

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.460
Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.
它基于一个非常简单，甚至微不足道的概念。

31
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.676
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,
你用不超过140个字说自己在做什么，

32
00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:37.000
and people who are interested in you get those updates.
对你感兴趣的人就会收到这些消息。

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.445
If they're really interested,
如果真的十分感兴趣，

34
00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:41.584
they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.
他们甚至可以通过短信在手机上获得这些信息。

35
00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.000
So, for instance, I may Twitter right now
例如，我现在就可以用Twitter发一条消息说

36
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.043
that I'm giving a talk at TED.
我正在TED上作演讲。

37
00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.784
And in my case, when I hit send,
对于我来说，当我选择发送后，

38
00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:53.050
up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.
几秒内，将有超过6万人会收到这条信息。

39
00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.421
Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter
Twitter的基本理念就是

40
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.860
lets people share moments of their lives
让人们随时分享他们生活中的

41
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:00.076
whenever they want,
任意时刻。

42
00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.383
be they momentous occasions
不管是意义非凡的场合，

43
00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:05.921
or mundane ones.
还是日常世俗的时候。

44
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:08.752
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening
通过分享这些正在发生的时刻

45
00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:12.526
that lets people feel more connected and in touch,
人们感觉彼此间的距离更近，联系更加紧密，

46
00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:14.706
despite distance, and in real time.
尽管他们不在一起。

47
00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:17.677
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,
我们开始时觉得这就是Twitter的主要用途，

48
00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:20.037
and what got us excited.
然而真正让我们感到兴奋的是，

49
00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:23.522
What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses
我们没有料到这个简单的系统

50
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.602
that would evolve from this very simple system.
竟然衍生出了许多其它的用途。

51
00:02:26.603 --> 00:02:28.600
One of the things we realized
我们发现，

52
00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.882
was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.
在突发事件中，Twitter可以发挥非常重要的作用。

53
00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:35.179
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,
2007年10月

54
00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.090
in October of 2007,
圣地亚哥发生了严重的火灾，

55
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.295
people turned to Twitter to report what was happening

56
00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.328

57

about what was happening around them.
来了解自己周围的情况。

58
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.406
But it wasn't just individuals.
不仅是一般人，

59
00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:47.989
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,
实际上，洛杉矶时报也依靠Twitter发布信息，

60
00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.006
and put a Twitter feed on the front page,
并在网站首页上放了一个Twitter订阅地址

61
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.093
and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross

62
00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:55.189
used it to dispense news and updates as well.
也通过Twitter发布各种最新的消息。

63
00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.252
At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering

and thousands of people around the world are following along

65
00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.897
because they want to know what it feels like to be here

00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:07.554

00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:12.245
from marketing and communications and predictable things,
也有很多通讯报道或是事件预报。

70
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:15.481
to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck
比如，一辆很火爆的韩式煎玉米饼快餐车在洛杉矶转来转去，

71
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:17.737
that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,
在Twitter上公布自己下一站停靠点，

72
00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:22.753
causing a line to form around the block.
结果食客们都在那里排队等待。

73
00:03:22.753 --> 00:03:25.799
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.

拥有Twitter账户。

76
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.070
And they're tweeting, in some cases,

from behind closed-door sessions with the President.

In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
看来，这家伙并不喜欢自己所听到的事情。

79
00:03:37.143 --> 00:03:40.665
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,

80
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:44.552
although his tweets have dropped off as of late,

while Senator McCain's have picked up.

82
00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:52.527
As have this guy's.
这个人也是。

83
00:03:52.527 --> 00:03:56.393
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:
Twitter最初只不过被设计成一个广播媒介。

84
00:03:56.393 --> 00:03:58.425
you send one message and it goes out to everybody,

85
00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.481
and you receive the messages you're interested in.
同时，你也能收到自己感兴趣的信息。

86
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.800
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter
但用户们还自己发明了很多Twitter的新用法，

87
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.481
was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person
例如，回复消息给特定的人，

88
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.788
or a specific message.
或者回复某条特定的消息。

89
00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.957
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here
比方说，大鲨鱼奥尼尔在这使用“@用户名”

90
00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:15.661
to reply to one of his fans,
来回复他的某个粉丝，

91
00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:17.500
was completely invented by users,
这种用法就完全是用户们自己发明的。

92
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.533
and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular
Twitter本来并不支持这种用法，直到大家都开始这么用的时候，

93
00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:22.500
and then we made it easier.
我们才增加了这个功能，方便用户。

94
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.331
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.
上面说到的只是用户帮助改进Twitter的众多方式之一。

95
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.100
Another is via the API.
还有一种方法是借助于API（应用编程接口）。

96
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.004
We built an application-programming interface,
我们提供了一些API，

97
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:33.322
which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
这样程序员可以编写其他程序来和Twitter交互。

98
00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:36.004
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software
目前大约有2000种程序

99
00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:37.356
that can send Twitter updates --
可以发送Twitter信息，

100
00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:41.845
interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --
他们可以运行在Mac，Windows，iPhone或黑莓上...

101
00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.237
as well as things like
同时，

102
00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:46.637
a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks
还有的设备可以在胎儿踢腿时发出Twitter信息，

103
00:04:46.637 --> 00:04:49.740
or a plant Twitter when it needs water.
或者当植物需要浇水时发出Twitter信息。

104
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.365
Probably the most important third-party development
这其中最重要的第三方程序或许要算来自

105
00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:55.125
came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
佛吉尼亚州的小公司Summize公司的产品了。

106
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.396
Summize built a Twitter search engine.
他们做了一个Twitter搜索引擎。

107
00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.206
And they tapped into the fact
他们利用了这样一个事实：

108
00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:01.413
that, if you have millions of people around the world
如果全世界有数百万人

109
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:03.821
talking about what they're doing and what's around them,
在谈论着他们正在做的或是他们身边发生的事情，

110
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:08.648
you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event
那你有机会从这些海量的信息中了解到

111
00:05:08.648 --> 00:05:10.293
while it's going on.
任何事情的进展。

112
00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:12.632
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.
这真的改变了我们对Twitter的理解。

113
00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:16.812
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
例如，这里显示的是人们对TED的评论。

114
00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:20.101
This is another way that our mind was shifted,
我们的想法进一步地改变

115
00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:22.461
and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.
Twitter并不仅是我们当初想象的那样。

116
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:24.878
We liked this so much we actually bought the company

117
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.310
and are folding it into the main product.
现在它成了我们一个主要产品。

118
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.694
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,
这不仅使你从不同的角度看待Twitter，

119
00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:33.134
but it introduces new use cases as well.
同时也带来了新的使用方法。

120
00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.846
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago
我最欣赏的一件事情发生在几个月前，

121
00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:38.393
when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
当时亚特兰大汽油短缺，

122
00:05:38.392 --> 00:05:40.132
Some users figured out
一些用户想到用Twitter记下

123
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:43.145
that they would Twitter when they found gas --
他们在哪发现的汽油，

124
00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:45.422
where it was, and how much it cost --
价格是多少，

125
00:05:45.422 --> 00:05:47.936
and then appended the keyword "#atlgas"
然后加上关键字“#altgas”

126
00:05:47.935 --> 00:05:51.613
which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.
这样其他人就可以搜索这个关键字并知道哪有汽油了。

127
00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:53.942
And this trend of people using this communication network
人们这种通过现代交流网络

128
00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:55.318
to help each other out
互相帮助的趋势

129
00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.162
goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.
远远超越了当初Twitter仅仅为了让人们方便地和家人、朋友交流的设想。

130
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:02.328
It's happened more and more lately,
这样的事情最近越来越多，

131
00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.814
whether it's raising money for homeless people
有关于为无家可归的人筹钱的，

132
00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:06.550
or to dig wells in Africa
有关于去非洲挖井的，

133
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.814
or for a family in crisis.
还有关于帮助处于危机中的家庭的。

134
00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:11.639
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter
有时人们在几天内就通过Twitter

135
00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.091
in a matter of days on several occasions.
募集了数万元，

136
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:21.168
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,
这样看来，人们如果有了更容易的分享信息渠道，

137
00:06:21.168 --> 00:06:23.735
more good things happen.
更多有益的事情就会发生。

138
00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:27.968
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.
我不知道今后Twitter将会如何，

139
00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:30.032
I've learned to follow the hunch,
但我学会了跟随直觉，

140
00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:33.175
but never assume where it will go.
并且从不假设结局。

141
00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:35.360
Thanks.
谢谢。

142
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.245
(Applause)
（掌声）

143
00:06:41.245 --> 00:06:43.016
Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.
Chris Anderson：我们还没结束呢。

144
00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:45.354
So, look, if we could have this screen live.
让我们来看看这屏幕能不能用...

145
00:06:45.353 --> 00:06:47.721
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do
这是一场演讲后，

146
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.383
after they've been to an event.
每个演讲者最害怕做的事情了。

147
00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:52.360
It's totally intimidating.
真得很可怕。

148
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.480
So, this would be the Twitter search screen.
那么，这是Twitter的搜索页面。

149
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.215
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.
让我们随便在上面敲几个字吧。

150
00:06:59.214 --> 00:07:04.614
For example: "Evan Williams."
比如说：“Evan Williams”

151
00:07:04.615 --> 00:07:08.923
"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."
“...给人更多的信息同时跟随你的直觉@#TED。”

152
00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:12.000
"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --"
“...正在听Evan Williams演讲。”

153
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.814
Oh.
哦！

154
00:07:12.814 --> 00:07:14.722
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.
“...Evan Williams快死在TED的台上了。

155
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:17.859
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter)
这是我听过最糟的演讲！”

156
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.413
Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.
Evan Williams：不错，谢谢。

157
00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:21.783
CA: Just kidding.
Chris Anderson：开个玩笑。

158
00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:24.538
But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,
但是，在他演讲的8分钟内，

159
00:07:24.538 --> 00:07:26.891
there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.
Twitter上已经有大约50条关于他演讲的消息。

160
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:29.492
So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:
所以他将会知道关于他演讲的各种反应：

161
00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:31.752
the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,
他说到的奥巴马是最受关注的Twitter用户，

162
00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:33.137
the fact that it came out of TED.
说到的Twitter最初源于TED...

163
00:07:33.137 --> 00:07:36.091
I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.
我觉得不会有其他什么办法能这么快得到反馈了。

164
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:38.367
You have build something very fascinating,
你做了个了不起的东西，

165
00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:40.690
and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.
而且看来它以后会变得更不得了。

166
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.399
So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.
非常感谢，Evan。
