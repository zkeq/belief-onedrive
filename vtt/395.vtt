1
00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm a relationship builder.
我是一位关系缔造者。

2
00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.936
When you think of a relationship builder,
当你想到这个词，

3
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.260
don't you just automatically think "architect?"
你第一时间会不会想到建筑师？

4
00:00:19.742 --> 00:00:21.165
Probably not.
可能不会吧。

5
00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:26.103
That's because most people think architects design buildings and cities,
因为一般人认为，建筑师只会设计大楼或城市而已。

6
00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:28.481
but what we really design are relationships,
但我们实际上设计的就是关系。

7
00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:31.310
because cities are about people.
因为城市离不开人，

8
00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:34.716
They're places where people come together for all kinds of exchange.
是人们相聚做各种交换的地方。

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.957
And besides, skylines are highly specific urban habitats
此外，天际线能反映出城市特有的居住生活型态，

10
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.299
with their own insects, plants and animals,
独特的昆虫、植物和动物，

11
00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:41.956
and even their own weather.
甚至城市本身的气候。

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.214
But today, urban habitats are out of balance.
但时至今日，城市的居住环境已失去平衡。

13
00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:50.831
Climate change, together with political and economic troubles, are having an impact;
全球的气候变化，伴随政治和经济问题，正在冲击着我们的城市；

14
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.167
they're adding up and stressing out cities and us,
它们凝聚了庞大的压力堆迭在城市和我们，

15
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:55.722
the people who live in them.
这些居住在城市里的居民身上。

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.445
For me, the field of ecology has provided important insight,
对我而言，生态学正好提供了我一个重要的设计感悟，

17
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.678
because ecologists don't just look at individual species on their own,
因为生态学本身不会只关注单一生物，

18
00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:07.895
they look at the relationships between living things
而是关注生态体系内所有的生物

19
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:09.168
and their environment.
以及周遭环境彼此间的关系。

20
00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:14.252
They look at how all the diverse parts of the ecosystem are interconnected,
它们会关注生态体系内所有不同物种间的连结关系，

21
00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:18.574
and it's actually this balance, this web of life, that sustains life.
而实际上，均衡的生命网络，才是永续生命的关键。

22
00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:23.680
My team and I have been applying insights from ecology to architecture
我和我的团队已经将生态学的观察应用在建筑上，

23
00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:27.698
to see how physical space can help build stronger relationships.
用它来观察实体空间要如何设计才能协助我们强化关系。

24
00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.086
The projects I'm going to show you today
我今天要介绍的项目

25
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.523
use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design.
都是以强化关系为设计主轴的一些项目。

26
00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:36.505
Here's an example of what I mean.
这个案例可以传达我要表达的概念：

27
00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.678
Recently, we were asked to design a center for social justice leadership
最近我们被应邀设计一个社会正义领导中心，

28
00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.252
called the Arcus Center.
叫做阿克斯中心（Arcus Center）；

29
00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:47.752
They asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups
他们要求我们设计一个能打破不同族群间传统隔阂的建筑物，

30
00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.023
and in doing so, create possibilities for meaningful conversations
从而促进各方坦率交流

31
00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:53.551
around social justice.
有关社会正义的话题。

32
00:01:53.973 --> 00:01:56.674
The students wanted a place for cultural exchange.
学生们要求一个有助于文化交流的地方，

33
00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.533
They thought a place for preparing food together could do that.
他们认为一个共用厨房能达成这个目的；

34
00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.288
And they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community.
他们也希望这栋建筑物也能受到外地居民的欢迎。

35
00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:05.975
They thought a fireplace could draw people in
他们认为壁炉可以吸引他们进来，

36
00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.295
and help start conversations.
并成为他们引发谈论的话题之一。

37
00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:14.281
And everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world.
最终所有人都希望世界各地都能看到他们社会正义项目的成果。

38
00:02:15.388 --> 00:02:18.129
There really wasn't a precedent for this kind of space,
这类的建筑没有先例可循，

39
00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:22.389
so we looked around the globe and found examples of community meeting houses.
于是我们到世界各地搜寻社区会议房屋的范例，

40
00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.984
Community meeting houses are places
有些社区会议房屋的空间氛围

41
00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:28.363
where there's very specific relationships between people,
在呈现人际关系上有着相当鲜明的特点，

42
00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:31.565
like this one in Mali, where the elders gather.
像在马里的这个地方，这里是长者聚会的地方，

43
00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.065
The low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye level.
低楼板的设计迫使每个人只能坐着平视彼此。

44
00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:36.808
It's very egalitarian.
它充满了平等主义的色彩。

45
00:02:36.832 --> 00:02:39.310
I mean, you can't stand up and take over the meeting.
我的意思是，你不能站起来主导会议，

46
00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:40.847
You'd actually bump your head.
站起来头就会撞到屋顶了。

47
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.524
(Laughter)
（笑声）

48
00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:45.162
In meeting houses, there's always a central space
在会议房屋中都有一个中央空间，

49
00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:47.837
where you can sit around a circle and see each other.
可以让大家围坐成一圈，互相对望。

50
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:51.885
So we designed a space just like that right in the middle of the Arcus Center,
所以我们在阿克斯中心的正中央，设计出了同样的空间，

51
00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.899
and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen.
并把壁炉和厨房固定在中央空间中。

52
00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:59.623
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes,
可是依建筑条例，要将壁炉和厨房设计到这栋建筑中是很困难的，

53
00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:02.449
but it was so important to the concept, we got it done.
但它是这栋建筑物的灵魂，我们最后实现了。

54
00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:06.863
And now the central space works for big social gatherings
现在的中央空间提供了大型聚会

55
00:03:06.913 --> 00:03:10.151
and a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time.
以及初次会面时，可单独谈话的地方，

56
00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.254
It's almost like this three-way intersection
它像个三叉路口，

57
00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:15.852
that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation.
鼓励人们不期而遇，进而交谈。

58
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.640
Now you can always pass the kitchen and see something going on.
所以每当你走过厨房时，一定可以看到正在进行的活动，

59
00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:23.011
You can sit by the fireplace and share stories.
你可选择坐在壁炉前分享故事，

60
00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:26.771
You can study together in big groups or in small ones,
或者跟大伙儿或几个人一起研讨，

61
00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:30.032
because the architecture sets up these opportunities.
因为建筑物的布局提供了这样的机会。

62
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.064
Even the construction is about building relationships.
甚至在建造的过程中也隐含着建立关系的意义：

63
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.949
It's made of cordwood masonry,
它是积木式的木块堆叠而成的建筑物，

64
00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:38.910
which is using logs the way you would use bricks.
用一块块木头像砖块般堆叠起来的。

65
00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.905
It's super low-tech and easy to do and anyone can do it --
技术水平要求不高，任何人都会做，

66
00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.606
and that's the entire point.
这也是设计的原意。

67
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.597
The act of making is a social activity.
建造的过程本身就是一种社会运动。

68
00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:50.240
And it's good for the planet, too:
这样的建筑方式对我们的地球也是友善的：

69
00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:53.360
the trees absorbed carbon when they were growing up,
树木在成长时吸二氧化碳，

70
00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.028
and they gave off oxygen,
吐出氧气。

71
00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:57.793
and now that carbon is trapped inside the walls
现在，这些碳留存在墙壁中，

72
00:03:57.817 --> 00:04:00.990
and it's not being released into the atmosphere.
而不是释放到大气层中，

73
00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:05.085
So making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road.
所以选用木头为建材等同于减少汽车污染。

74
00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.238
We chose the building method
我们会选用这样的建造方式，

75
00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:12.208
because it connects people to each other and to the environment.
是因为它能联系人与人，和人与大自然。

76
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.406
But is it working?
但这样有效吗？

77
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.696
Is it creating relationships and nurturing them?
它能创造并增进关系吗？

78
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.038
How can we know?
我们如何证实？

79
00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:21.377
Well, more and more people are coming here, for one,
第一，越来越多人来阿克斯中心；

80
00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:23.817
and as a result of the fireside chats
还有，得力于壁炉前交流的魅力，

81
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:25.939
and a full calendar of programming,
以及全年度丰富的活动安排，

82
00:04:25.963 --> 00:04:28.551
people are applying for the Arcus Fellowships.
吸引了很多人申请成为阿克斯会员。

83
00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:32.874
In fact, applications have increased tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship
事实上，申请书的数量从开放那天到现在

84
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.163
since the building opened.
已增加了十倍。

85
00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:36.857
It's working. It's bringing people together.
它是有效的，也成功拉近了人与人之间的距离。

86
00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:40.442
So I've shown how architecture can connect people
我向各位展示了，建筑设计如何把人与人

87
00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:42.624
on this kind of horizontal campus scale.
在水平维度上连接起来。

88
00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:49.340
But we wondered if social relationships could be scaled up -- or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.
但我们也反问自己，人际关系的孕育是否也能应用于高层建筑物中呢？

89
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:54.238
Tall buildings don't necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings.
高层大楼本身就不是以交流作为目的。

90
00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:56.255
They can seem isolating and inward.
它们看起来就是孤独和内敛的。

91
00:04:56.646 --> 00:05:01.178
You might only see people in those awkward elevator rides.
你可能会在搭电梯的这种尴尬场合中，才会遇到其他人。

92
00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:06.007
But in several major cities, I've been designing tall buildings
但我已经在几个大都市中，

93
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:09.356
that are based on creating relationships between people.
设计了以强化关系为目的的高层大厦，

94
00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.872
This is Aqua.
像这个大楼叫做水厦。

95
00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:14.470
It's a residential high-rise in Chicago
它是一栋芝加哥的高层住宅，

96
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:17.105
aimed at young urban professionals and empty nesters,
对象是年轻的都市专业人士和空巢老人，

97
00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.772
many of them new to the city.
很多住户还是第一次搬来芝加哥。

98
00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:23.563
With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see if we could use architecture
这栋大厦有超过700个公寓，我们想要知道是否可以透过建筑设计

99
00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:25.658
to help people get to know their neighbors,
帮助居民建立起与邻居间的友谊，

100
00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:28.932
even when their homes are organized in the vertical dimension.
即使他们的家都是纵向排列的。

101
00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:34.624
So we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors.
所以我们发明了一种方法，利用阳台做为新的社交连接器。

102
00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.322
The shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower.
从一楼到顶楼，每层的楼板线条都略有不同。

103
00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:45.616
The result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony.
这样的设计结果是你可以在阳台上看到其他人。

104
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.773
The balconies are misregistered.
阳台是交错的。

105
00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.941
You can lean over your balcony and say, "Hey!"
你大可以在阳台上弯身大喊 “嗨！”

106
00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:52.166
just like you would across the backyard.
就好像你快要爬到对方的后花园一样。

107
00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:54.846
To make the balconies more comfortable
为了让阳台更舒适，

108
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.147
for a longer period of time during the year,
并在全年延长享用阳台的时间，

109
00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:59.601
we studied the wind with digital simulations,
我们用电脑模拟风向，

110
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.523
so the effect of the balcony shapes breaks up the wind
确定阳台的形状可以缓冲风力，

111
00:06:02.547 --> 00:06:03.858
and confuses the wind
让风涡相冲，

112
00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:06.939
and makes the balconies more comfortable and less windy.
使阳台更舒适并能减缓风力。

113
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.879
Now, just by being able to go outside on your balcony
你只要走到外面的阳台，

114
00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.978
or on the third floor roof terrace,
或站在第三层的楼顶台阶上，

115
00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.061
you can be connected to the outdoors,
你就能置身在户外当中，

116
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.242
even when you're way above the ground plane.
即使你离地面很远。

117
00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:19.965
So the building acts to create community
这样的建筑模式成功地建立起了邻里关系，

118
00:06:19.965 --> 00:06:22.600
within the building and the city at the same time.
不管在大楼内，还是城市内，

119
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.836
It's working.
它都是成功的。

120
00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:28.683
And people are starting to meet each other on the building surface
大楼的住户开始在墙外的阳台相遇，

121
00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:29.863
and we've heard --
我们还听过 ——

122
00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:30.943
(Laughter)
（笑声）

123
00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:33.735
they've even starting getting together as couples.
也有人因此相识而成为伴侣。

124
00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:37.203
But besides romantic relationships,
但是除了情侣关系，

125
00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:41.428
the building has a positive social effect on the community,
这大楼确实可以把正能量带到社区之中。

126
00:06:41.452 --> 00:06:44.139
as evidenced by people starting groups together
这一点可以从住户自发创立团体，

127
00:06:44.163 --> 00:06:46.009
and starting big projects together,
一起做些大项目来证明，

128
00:06:45.993 --> 00:06:50.009
like this organic community garden on the building's roof terrace.
就像这个在大厦顶的有机社区花园。

129
00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:54.710
So I've shown how tall buildings can be social connectors,
我已经示范了高层大楼真的可以成为社交枢纽。

130
00:06:54.734 --> 00:06:56.726
but what about public architecture?
可是公共建筑也可以吗？

131
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.994
How can we create better social cohesion in public buildings and civic spaces,
我们如何在公共建筑与市民空间中创造出更具凝聚力的社交关系呢？

132
00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:03.451
and why is it important?
为什么这点很重要呢？

133
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.987
Public architecture is just not as successful
因为公共建筑如果是由上层所决定的，

134
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:07.935
if it comes from the top down.
通常都不会成功。

135
00:07:09.313 --> 00:07:11.411
About 15 years ago in Chicago,
大概在十五年前，

136
00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:14.542
they started to replace old police stations,
芝加哥政府开始重建老旧的公安局，

137
00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.736
and they built this identical model all over the city.
他们最后在整个城市里建造了很多外形一模一样的公安局。

138
00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.880
And even though they had good intentions
虽然政府用意是好的，

139
00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:23.402
of treating all neighborhoods equally,
想平等对待每一个社区；

140
00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.846
the communities didn't feel invested in the process
但社区居民都不觉得有参与感，

141
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.384
or feel a sense of ownership of these buildings.
或是对这些建筑物没有归属感。

142
00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:31.935
It was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station,
政府公平地给了每一个人同样外貌的公安局，

143
00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:35.313
but it wasn't equity in the sense of responding
但是从各个社区的个别需求回应里，

144
00:07:35.337 --> 00:07:37.695
to each community's individual needs.
呈现出来的却是不平等的。

145
00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.560
And equity is the key issue here.
而平等才是关键。

146
00:07:40.584 --> 00:07:48.808
You know, in my field, there's a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships.
在建筑行业中，对于到底建筑设计是否能起到促进社会关系的功能，仍有争议。

147
00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:54.266
But I believe that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit
但我相信，我们可以利用建筑设计和我们拥有的每一个工具，

148
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.228
to improve these relationships.
来改善这些关系。

149
00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:02.344
In the US, policy reforms have been recommended in order to rebuild trust.
在美国，为了重建社会信任，有些人建议要改革政策。

150
00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:03.776
But my team and I wondered
但是我和我的团队在想

151
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.516
if design and a more inclusive design process could help add something positive to this policy conversation.
是否设计本身和包容性的设计过程可以为政策对话带来实质的帮助。

152
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.226
We asked ourselves simply:
我们问自己：

153
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.206
Can design help rebuild trust?
设计是否能重新修复信任？

154
00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:19.250
So we reached out to community members and police officers in North Lawndale;
我们联络了北隆戴尔区的社区人员和警局官员；

155
00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:20.833
it's a neighborhood in Chicago
该区位于芝加哥，

156
00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:25.386
where the police station is perceived as a scary fortress surrounded by a parking lot.
居民都视公安局为一座被停车场围绕的可怕的堡垒。

157
00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:28.692
In North Lawndale, people are afraid of police
在北隆戴尔，居民都很害怕警察，

158
00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:30.921
and of going anywhere near the police station,
甚至不敢走近警察局，

159
00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:32.232
even to report a crime.
即使是去报案。

160
00:08:32.663 --> 00:08:37.098
So we organized this brainstorming session with both groups participating,
所以我们安排了一场由警察和居民共同参与的头脑风暴会议。

161
00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:40.302
and we came up with this whole new idea for the police station.
最后我们讨论出一个关于警察局的全新概念：

162
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.866
It's called "Polis Station."
我们称之为 “波乐司"（“Polis"） 。

163
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.610
"Polis" is a Greek word that means a place with a sense of community.
波乐司是希腊文：意思是一个有社区意义的地方。

164
00:08:48.348 --> 00:08:49.968
It's based on the idea
这个概念就是：

165
00:08:49.992 --> 00:08:56.246
that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members,
如果你能够增加警察和区民之间正向的接触机会，

166
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.465
you can rebuild that relationship
就可以重建友善的关系，

167
00:08:58.489 --> 00:09:01.203
and activate the neighborhood at the same time.
并同时让整个社区活跃起来。

168
00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:05.108
Instead of the police station as a scary fortress,
警察局不再是一座 可怕的堡垒，

169
00:09:05.132 --> 00:09:09.589
you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station --
取而代之的是其中生气勃勃的公共空间——

170
00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:11.123
places that spark conversation,
一个能鼓励谈话的空间，

171
00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:13.707
like a barbershop, a coffee shop
比如理发店，咖啡馆，

172
00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:15.304
or sports courts as well.
或者运动场。

173
00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:17.507
Both cops and kids said they love sports.
警察和青年人都一致说他们热爱运动。

174
00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:23.906
These insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves,
这个概念是直接由社区居民和警局官员们共同提出来的。

175
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.689
and as designers, our role was just to connect the dots
我们设计师的使命就是把这些概念连贯起来，

176
00:09:27.713 --> 00:09:29.335
and suggest the first step.
协助把这些落实而已。

177
00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.287
So with the help of the city and the parks,
我们获得了城市和公园相关部门的帮助，

178
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.597
we were able to raise funds and design and build a half-court,
得以筹款、设计、以及建造一个小型篮球场，

179
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:38.961
right on the police station parking lot.
就在警察局的停车场中。

180
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:40.426
It's a start.
这是一个起步。

181
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.318
But is it rebuilding trust?
但这是否真的能重建信任呢？

182
00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:46.250
The people in North Lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day
住在北隆戴尔区的居民说小孩每天都在篮球场玩，

183
00:09:46.274 --> 00:09:49.623
and they even organize tournaments like this one shown here,
甚至还策划比赛——就像视频所展示的那样，

184
00:09:49.647 --> 00:09:52.261
and once in a while an officer joins in.
偶尔会有警官参与。

185
00:09:54.084 --> 00:09:56.750
But now, they even have basketballs inside the station
现在，在警察局内也建了一个篮球场，

186
00:09:56.774 --> 00:09:58.039
that kids can borrow.
孩子们可以借用。

187
00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:00.555
And recently they've asked us to expand the courts
最近，他们请我们扩大这些篮球场，

188
00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.522
and build a park on the site.
还打算盖一个公园在旁边。

189
00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:06.827
And parents report something astonishing.
父母亲们反馈了一些让人惊讶的事情：

190
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:11.542
Before, there was fear of going anywhere the station, and now they say
以往，大家都怕接近警察局，而如今

191
00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:14.957
there's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby,
他们觉得这个篮球场比附近的其它篮球场安全多了。

192
00:10:14.957 --> 00:10:17.351
and they prefer their kids to play here.
父母都很愿意让孩子们在这儿玩。

193
00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:21.357
So maybe in the future, on the public side of the station,
所以，或许将来在警察局内的公共区域，

194
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:25.086
you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop
你很可能来这儿的理发店剪个头发，

195
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.759
or reserve the community room for a birthday party
或预约公用礼堂来举行生日派对，

196
00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:29.426
or renew your driver's license
或申请延长驾照等，

197
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.548
or get money out of an ATM.
或在自动提款机取钱。

198
00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:34.699
It can be a place for neighbors to meet each other
此处也可以是居民互相见面的地方，

199
00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:37.426
and to get to know the officers, and vice versa.
以及和警官互相认识的地方。

200
00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.545
This is not a utopian fantasy.
这绝对不是个乌托邦式的幻想。

201
00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:46.068
It's about how do you design to rebuild trust, trusting relationships?
关键是要懂得如何用设计来重新建立起信任、信任的关系。

202
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:50.620
You know, every city has parks, libraries, schools
众所周知，每个都市都有公园、图书馆、学校，

203
00:10:50.644 --> 00:10:52.038
and other public buildings
以及 其它公共设施，

204
00:10:51.982 --> 00:10:56.834
that have the potential to be reimagined as social connectors.
这些都有可能成为社交连接器。

205
00:10:56.954 --> 00:11:00.984
But reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require
但要重新想像未来的建筑如何重建，

206
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:03.116
engaging the people who live there.
首先必定要让当地的民众参与。

207
00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:07.687
Engaging the public can be intimidating, and I've felt that, too.
让民众参与听起来或许有些吓人，我本人也担心过。

208
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:09.992
But maybe that's because in architecture school,
或许是因为在上建筑学校时，

209
00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:13.957
we don't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design.
我们都没学过如何引导市民参与设计。

210
00:11:13.957 --> 00:11:17.157
We're taught to defend our design against criticism.
我们只学到如何去辩解市民对我们设计的批评。

211
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.662
But I think that can change, too.
但我相信这是可以改变的。

212
00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:27.390
So if we can focus the design mind on creating positive, reinforcing relationships
只要我们一心关注如何利用设计来创造正面、双赢的关系；

213
00:11:27.414 --> 00:11:29.394
in architecture and through architecture,
不管是建筑物本体还是间接从中引发的，

214
00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:33.284
I believe we can do much more than create individual buildings.
我相信，除了外观设计，建筑师是能创造很多利益的。

215
00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:38.848
We can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats.
我们可以缓和城市居住地的压力和两极分化状况。

216
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.965
We can create relationships.
