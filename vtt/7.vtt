planetary scientist --
行星科学家——

5
00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:27.557
we really didn't take that very seriously until recently.
我们很久以来都没有认真的 考虑过这个问题。

6
00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:30.573
Carl Sagan always said,
卡尔·萨根 （译注：美国天文学家）常说，

7
00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:35.997
"It takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims."

And the claims of having life beyond Earth
地球之外有生命的断言

9
00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:43.613
need to be definitive,
必须是明确的，

10
00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:45.253
they need to be loud
必须是响亮的,

11
00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:49.837
and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it.
还需要证据充分，这样我们才会相信。

12
00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:53.437
So how do we make this journey?

What we decided to do
我们决定

14
00:00:55.797 --> 00:00:59.997
is first look for those ingredients for life.

17
00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:05.973
we have to have a solvent,

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.837
Well, I have to tell you that early in my career,
我必须坦白， 在我职业生涯早期，

29
00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:41.853
when we looked at those three elements,

30
00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:44.133
I didn't believe that they were beyond Earth

31
00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:48.253
in any length of time and for any real quantity.

32
00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:50.533
Why? We look at the inner planets.

37
00:01:58.957 --> 00:02:01.917
the water in the solar system is all frozen.
水全部冻成了固态的冰。

38
00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:07.333
But recent observations have changed all that.

41
00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:17.397
and really start to answer our life question.

42
00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.173
So when we look out into the solar system,
那么，当我们探索太阳系时，

43
00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.836
where are the possibilities?
生命可能存在于哪里呢？

44
00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:26.677
We're concentrating our attention on four locations.
我们将注意力集中在以下四处：

45
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.757
The planet Mars
火星

46
00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:32.717
and then three moons of the outer planets:

47
00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:37.557
Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.
泰坦（土卫六），欧罗巴（木卫二） 和小小的恩赛拉多斯（土卫二）。

48
00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:40.693
So what about Mars?
火星到底是什么情况呢？

49
00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:42.517
Let's go through the evidence.
让我们看看证据。

50
00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:47.533
Well, Mars we thought was initially moon-like:
起初我们以为火星像月亮一样：

51
00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:51.917
full of craters, arid and a dead world.
布满陨石坑，荒凉，没有生命。

52
00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:55.173
And so about 15 years ago,

53
00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:58.813
we started a series of missions to go to Mars

54
00:02:58.837 --> 00:03:03.453
and see if water existed on Mars in its past

55
00:03:03.477 --> 00:03:05.733
that changed its geology.

56
00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:07.477
We ought to be able to notice that.
我们应该可以观察得到。

57
00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:11.573
And indeed we started to be surprised right away.

58
00:03:11.597 --> 00:03:16.733
Our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys

59
00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:18.437
that were there in the past.

63
00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:31.373
has really shown us that it's sitting in an ancient river bed,

64
00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:33.797
where water flowed rapidly.

65
00:03:34.357 --> 00:03:35.813
And not for a little while,
时间还不短，

66
00:03:35.837 --> 00:03:38.317
perhaps hundreds of millions of years.
可能曾持续过数亿年之久。

67
00:03:39.077 --> 00:03:40.493
And if everything was there,
如果所有要素都存在，

68
00:03:40.517 --> 00:03:41.853
including organics,

而是灰色的，

75
00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:56.333
it's gray Mars.
火星地表下面是灰色的。

76
00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:57.813
We brought it into the rover,

77
00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.453
we tasted it,
仔细地分析了它，

78
00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:00.933
and guess what?
你们猜怎么着？

79
00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:02.973

99
00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:46.613
A few months ago the fairy tale came true.

107
00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:14.413
In its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere --

00:05:32.357 --> 00:05:34.837
And now it's more appealing than ever before.
现在行动要比以往 任何时候都更有吸引力。

117
00:05:35.757 --> 00:05:38.373
As we move out into the solar system,

118
00:05:38.397 --> 00:05:41.373
here's the tiny moon Enceladus.
有一个小小的土卫二。

119
00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:44.773
This is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone,

This is much further out.
这里离太阳很远。

122
00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:53.597
This object should be ice over a silicate core.
这个星球应该像个 被冰层覆盖的硅酸盐核心。

123
00:05:54.277 --> 00:05:55.893
But what did we find?
但我们找到了什么？

124
00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:58.853
Cassini was there since 2006,
自2006年起，卡西尼太空船就在那里，

125
00:05:58.877 --> 00:06:03.253
and after a couple years looked back after it flew by Enceladus

129
00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:16.013
What a fabulous environment.
多么美妙的环境啊。

130
00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:20.853
Cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume,

131
00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:23.277
and it measured silicate particles.
它检测到了硅酸盐颗粒。

132
00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:25.733
Where does the silica come from?
这些硅从哪来的？

133
00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:28.117
It must come from the ocean floor.
它肯定是从海底来的。

134
00:06:28.877 --> 00:06:32.013
The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,
土星产生的潮汐动能

135
00:06:32.037 --> 00:06:34.173
pulling and squeezing this moon --
拉扯，挤压着这个星球——

136
00:06:34.197 --> 00:06:35.853
is melting that ice,
正融化那里的冰，

137
00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:37.333
creating an ocean.
形成着海洋。

138
00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:39.677
But it's also doing that to the core.
这潮汐能同样 拉扯挤压着硅酸盐核心。

139
00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:42.533
Now, the only thing that we can think of
我们唯一能想到

140
00:06:42.557 --> 00:06:45.397
that does that here on Earth as an analogy ...
地球上类似的现象是——

141
00:06:46.117 --> 00:06:48.317
are hydrothermal vents.
深海热泉。

142
00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:55.133
Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977.
深海热泉在1977年的时候 在海洋深处被发现。

143
00:06:55.157 --> 00:06:57.917
Oceanographers were completely surprised.
海洋学家们对此非常惊讶。

144
00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:01.917
And now there are thousands of these below the ocean.
如今在海洋之下 有成千上万这样的深海热泉。

145
00:07:03.277 --> 00:07:04.533
What do we find?
我们找到了什么？

146
00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:07.893
The oceanographers, when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents,
当海洋学家们研究这些深海热泉时发现

147
00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:09.213
they're teeming with life,
那里有富饶的生命，

148
00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:13.773
regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline --
不管水是酸性的还是碱性的——

149
00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:15.333
doesn't matter.
这不重要。

150
00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:20.077
So hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.
