If you've been thinking about US politics

and trying to make sense of it for the last year or so,

3
00:00:20.627 --> 00:00:24.286
you might have hit on something like the following three propositions:

one, US partisanship has never been so bad before;

two,

for the first time, it's geographically spatialized --

9
00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:44.801
and third,

there's nothing we can do about it.
我们对此无能为力。

11
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.731
I'm here to today to say that all three of these propositions,

all of which sound reasonable,

we actually have an extraordinary mechanism

I want to go back to a pivotal moment in US history,

he said the reason that the press was so pro-Federalist

is that the advertisers were all Federalists,

But the design of the Constitution is greater than partisanship.

It enables us to manage partisanship when that's possible,
