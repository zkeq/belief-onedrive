﻿1
00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:18.666
I have spent the past 38 years trying to be invisible.
在过去38年的时间里，我都试图做一个隐形人

2
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.079
I'm a copy editor.
我是一名审稿员

3
00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:23.327
I work at The New Yorker,
我在纽约客工作（美国知名杂志）

4
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:27.525
and copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop
为纽约客改稿子

5
00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:29.763
for a Major League Baseball team:
就像是为职业棒球联盟打游击手一样

6
00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:33.200
every little movement gets picked over by the critics --
每一个微小的动作，都会被批评家们挑出刺儿来

7
00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.826
God forbid you should commit an error.
上帝禁止你出任何差错

8
00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:40.843
Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine.
先澄清一点：审稿人并没有权利选择可以被发表的文章

9
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.728
We work at the level of the sentence,
我们在句子层面工作

10
00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.440
maybe the paragraph,
也兼顾篇章

11
00:00:45.464 --> 00:00:47.542
the words, the punctuation.
我们看的是字词、标点

12
00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:50.700
Our business is in the details.
我们的工作主要集中于细节

13
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:55.858
We put the diaeresis, the double dot, over the "i" in "naïve."
我们加入分音符，就是在 "naïve"中字母i上面的两个点

14
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.338
We impose house style.
我们做独特的印刷风格

15
00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:01.048
Every publication has a house style.
每一份出版刊物都有自己的印刷风格

16
00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:03.595
The New Yorker's is particularly distinctive.
纽约客的风格更是别具一格

17
00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:07.103
We sometimes get teased for our style.
我们有时候会因为独特的风格而遭到嘲笑

18
00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:11.467
Imagine -- we still spell "teen-ager" with a hyphen,
设想一下，我们仍然在拼写“teen-ager”的时候加上连字符

19
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.767
as if that word had just been coined.
就像这词才刚刚被造出来似的

20
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:18.339
But you see that hyphen in "teen-age"
但是你一看到在“teen-age”里面的连字符

21
00:01:18.363 --> 00:01:20.955
and that diaeresis over "coöperate,"
和在“cöoperate”上面的分音符

22
00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.981
and you know you're reading The New Yorker.
你就知道你正在读的是纽约客了

23
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.168
Copyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process.
在纽约客做编辑是一个机械的过程

24
00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:30.391
There is a related role called query proofreading,
有一个与此相关的环节叫做查询校对

25
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.271
or page-OK'ing.
或者叫“让这一页OK”

26
00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:35.549
Whereas copyediting is mechanical,
与机械性的编辑工作形成对照的是

27
00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:38.048
query proofreading is interpretive.
查询校对起到解释说明的作用

28
00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.888
We make suggestions to the author through the editor
我们通过编者来对作者提出建议

29
00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:44.533
to improve the emphasis of a sentence
以便能够加强句子语气

30
00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:47.191
or point out unintentional repetitions

31
00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:51.211
and supply compelling alternatives.
也会提出更有力的替代选项

32
00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:55.300
Our purpose is to make the author look good.
我们的目的是让作者看起来更完美

33
00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:58.653
Note that we give our proofs not directly to the author,
既然我们不是把校对意见直接告诉作者

34
00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:00.196
but to the editor.
而是告诉编辑

35
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.337
This often creates a good cop/bad cop dynamic
这就会造成好人/坏人的动态转换

36
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.885
in which the copy editor -- I'll use that as an umbrella term --
在这个过程中，审稿员-我来解释一下-

37
00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.916
is invariably the bad cop.
是永恒不变的坏人

38
00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:14.265
If we do our job well, we're invisible,
如果我们把工作做好了，我们就能继续隐形

39
00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.361
but as soon as we make a mistake,
可是一旦我们犯了错

40
00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:20.201
we copy editors become glaringly visible.
我们审稿员就会成为众矢之的

41
00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:24.777
Here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.
这是我最近犯的错误

42
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:29.275

45
00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:38.963

有读者问，“纽约客传说中的审稿员都干嘛去了”

46
00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:42.153

“难道作者想说的不是know-knowingism(不可知论)吗？”

47
00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:43.886
Ouch.
哦==

48
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.582
There's no excuse for this mistake.
犯这种错误是没有任何借口的

49
00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:49.695
But I like it: "no-nothingism."
但是我喜欢no-nothingism

50
00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.677
It might be American vernacular for "nihilism."
这有可能是美国版的“虚无主义”呀

51
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:56.908
(Laughter)
（笑）

52
00:02:56.932 --> 00:02:59.956
Here, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:

[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained her authoritative bearing;

54
00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:08.019
only her unsteady gait belied her age.]

He added:

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.848
"Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,'
“当然了，纽约客里的人知道“belied（与...不相符）”的意思

57
00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:16.080
and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence.
但在这个句子里却完全把这个单词用反了

58
00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:17.778
Come on! Get it together."
别闹了！认真点行么！”

59
00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:21.976
Belie: to give a false impression.
Belie的意思是，给别人以错误的印象

60
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.047
It should have been "betrayed."
在这儿应该用“暴露”这个词更加合适

61
00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:28.121
E.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker:
E.B. White有一次写到纽约客里的逗号，他说

62
00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:33.009
"They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body."
“他们像用刀去描绘人体轮廓一样，精准的分毫不差”

63
00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.735
(Laughter)
（笑）

64
00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.565
And it's true -- we get a lot of complaints about commas.
这是事实，我们收到了好多关于逗号的投诉

"Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"
“在'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'里 真的有两个逗号吗？”

66
00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:47.647
There may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New Yorker style for "Jr."
也许没有明确的说明， 但是没错，这就是纽约客写 "Jr."的风格

67

In this case, those commas are well-placed,

同样，如果在“at least (至少)”这个短语周围需要逗号的话

77
00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:14.326

【她的脸和手很突出，好像在古老的，全黑的画作里】

144
00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:16.813
Now, unlike with the hurricane,
不像是描述风暴时使用的“like”

145
00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:19.305
with this "like," the author didn't have the excuse
这一次，作者没什么理由

146
00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:21.136
of describing hurricane damage.
使用“like（好像）”这个词

147
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.456
"Like" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object,
“like”在这儿是个介词，介词后面得是一个物体

148
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.673
which is a noun.
也就是个名词

149
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:29.229
This "like" had to be an "as."
这里的“like”得换成“as”

150
00:07:29.253 --> 00:07:32.411
"As in an old, mostly dark painting."
“如同存在于古老的，黑色的画作之中”

151
00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:34.085
Second, a spelling issue.
第二个是拼写问题

152
00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:37.104
The author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:
作者引用了某个助手的一句话

153
00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:39.228
["It will be just a minute.
【“马上就好，

154
00:07:39.252 --> 00:07:41.893
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]
我们即将扩音（mic'ed）正义”】

155
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.404
Mic'ed?
Mic‘ed?

156
00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:46.799
The music industry spells it "mic"
音乐人把话筒（microphone）拼写成“mic”

157
00:07:46.823 --> 00:07:49.181
because that's how it's spelled on the equipment.
因为在设备上印的就是“mic”三个字母

158
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:51.632
I'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling,
但是我从来没见过这个单词被用作动词

159
00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:54.186
and I was distraught to think that "mic'ed"
一想到"mic'ed"要出现在我审阅过的杂志里

160
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.495
would get into the magazine on my watch.
我真的会抓狂

161
00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.530
(Laughter)
（笑）

162
00:07:57.554 --> 00:08:01.473
New Yorker style for "microphone" in its abbreviated form is "mike."
纽约客把“microphone”简写成“mike”

163
00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.966
Finally, there was a sticky grammar and usage issue
最后，还有一个很麻烦的语法和使用问题

164
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.704
in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number
代词跟先行词要在语法数量上

165
00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:10.179
as its antecedent.
保持一致

166
00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:14.707
[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]
【每一个在附近的人，都屏住了他们的呼吸】

167
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:19.506
"Their" is plural and "everyone," its antecedent, is singular.
“他们的”是复数形式，而作为先行词的“每个人”是单数

168
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.468
You would never say, "Everyone were there."
你永远不会说 “每个人一起在”

169
00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:26.333
Everyone was there. Everyone is here.
每个人曾经在，每个人现在在

170
00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:29.971
But people say things like, "Everyone held their breath" all the time.
但是人们总在说“每个人屏住他们的呼吸”

171
00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:31.214
To give it legitimacy,
为了让这些句子看起来更合理

172
00:08:31.238 --> 00:08:34.661
copy editors call it "the singular 'their,'"
审稿员给它们取了个名字，叫做“单数的他们”

173
00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:37.750
as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.
就好像把它叫做单数，这个词就不再是复数了一样

174
00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:39.168
(Laughter)
（笑）

175
00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:44.391
It is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it.
我的工作就是当我看到这种句子被印出来的时候 尽可能的去消除它们

176
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.668
I couldn't make it, "Everyone held her breath,"
我不能把句子改成“每个人都屏住她的呼吸”

177
00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:49.384
or "Everyone held his breath,"
或者是“每个人都屏住他的呼吸”

178
00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:51.970
or "Everyone held his or her breath."
或者“每个人都屏住他的或她的呼吸”

179
00:08:51.994 --> 00:08:54.814
Whatever I suggested had to blend in.
我提的建议得让句子融到一起

180
00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:56.194
I asked, through the editor,
我通过编辑来询问

181
00:08:56.218 --> 00:08:58.266
if the author would consider changing it
作者愿不愿意把句子改成

182
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.861
to "All in the vicinity held their breath,"
“所有在附近的人都屏住了他们的呼吸”

183
00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:02.727
because "all" is plural.
因为“所有人”是复数

184
00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:03.908
Nope.
不行

185
00:09:03.932 --> 00:09:07.162
I tried again: "All those present held their breath?"
我再问 “所有出席的人都屏住了他们的呼吸？”

186
00:09:07.186 --> 00:09:09.407
I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.
我觉得这个听起来模模糊糊还算公正

187
00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:10.678
But the editor pointed out
但是编辑说

188
00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:13.107
that we could not have "present" and "presence"
我们不能把“出席的(present)”和“出席(presence)”

189
00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:14.574
in the same sentence.
放到一个句子里

190
00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:16.507
When the final proof came back,
校对过的最后版本出来时

191
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.107
the author had accepted "as" for "like,"
作者接受了把“like”换成“as”

192
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:21.066
and "miked" for "mic'ed."
也把“mic'ed”换成了"miked"

193
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.564
But on "Everyone held their breath," he stood his ground.
但是在“每个人都屏住了他们的呼吸”这个句子上 作者维持原状

194
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.706
Two out of three isn't bad.
三个改了两个，也还不错吧

195
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.073
In the same issue,
同样的

196
00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:31.619
in that piece on doggie bags in France,
在那个讲法国食品袋的文章里

197
00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:35.381
there was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman.
法国人无缘无故的说了好多脏话

198
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.684
I wonder, when the mail comes in,
我很好奇，再次受到来信的时候，

199
00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:41.566
which will have offended the readers more.
到底是哪一个会让读者更加愤怒

200
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.263
(Laughter)
（笑）

201
00:09:43.287 --> 00:09:44.438
Thank you.

202
00:09:44.462 --> 00:09:47.814
(Applause)
