1
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.196
So there's this thing called the law of unintended consequences.
有一种东西叫意外结果定律。

2
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.996
I thought it was just like a saying,
我还以为这只是说说而已，

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.556
but it actually exists, I guess.
但是这一定律真实存在。

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.500
There's, like, academic papers about it.
这方面有一些学术文章。

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.196
And I'm a designer.
我是个设计师，

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.076
I don't like unintended consequences.
我不喜欢意外结果。

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.676
People hire me because they have consequences that they really intend,
人们雇佣我，就是因为他们 想要达到某个结果，

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.556
and what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences.
而他们希望我 帮他们达到这个目标。

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.596
So I live in fear of unintended consequences.
所以我活在对意外结果的恐惧中。

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.300
And so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended.
这个故事是关于计划中 和意料外的结果的。

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.036
I got called by an organization called Robin Hood
一个叫罗宾汉的组织打电话给我，

12
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.636
to do a favor for them.
希望我帮个忙。

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.076
Robin Hood is based in New York, a wonderful philanthropic organization
罗宾汉是一个总部在纽约的很棒的慈善组织，

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.836
that does what it says in the name.
他们的任务就如同其名字一样，

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.636
They take from rich people, give it to poor people.
损有余而补不足

16
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.556
In this case, what they wanted to benefit was the New York City school system,
这次，他们想为纽约的学校做贡献，

17
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.916
a huge enterprise that educates more than a million students at a time,
这些学校接收了超过一百万学生，

18
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.276
and in buildings that are like this one,
在像这栋楼一样的楼里提供教育。

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.196
old buildings, big buildings,
都是些很老的大楼，

20
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.356
drafty buildings, sometimes buildings that are in disrepair,
十分破旧，有的年久失修，

21
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.916
certainly buildings that could use a renovation.
因此其中一些需要整修。

22
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.196
Robin Hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way,
罗宾汉的本意是想 改善这些楼的设施，

23
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.676
but what they realized was
但他们意识到

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.236
to fix the buildings would be too expensive and impractical.
整修这些楼不仅昂贵，而且不现实。

25
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.636
So instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into
所以， 他们想是不是能 在尽量多的楼里，

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.716
in each of these buildings, in as many buildings that they could,
每栋楼选择一个房间，

27
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.396
and fix that one room

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.236
so that they could improve the lives of the children inside

29
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.476
as they were studying.
提高他们的生活品质。

30
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.916
And what they came up with was the school library,
他们决定修建学校图书馆，

31
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.876
and they came up with this idea called the Library Initiative.
称之为“图书馆计划”。

32
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.276
All the students have to pass through the library.
所有学生都会经过图书馆。

33
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.636
That's where the books are.
图书馆有书，

34
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.996
That's where the heart and soul of the school is.
是学校的心脏和灵魂所在。

35
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.436
So let's fix these libraries.
所以我们得弄好这些图书馆。

36
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.996
So they did this wonderful thing where they brought in
他们开始做这件美好的 事情，请来了

37
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.116
first 10, then 20, then more architects,
开始是10位，然后是20位， 接着是更多的建筑师，

38
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.876
each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was.
每个人都被分配了一个图书馆， 来重新思考图书馆的定义。

39
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.956
They trained special librarians.
他们培养了一些 特别的图书馆管理员。

40
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.036
So they started this mighty enterprise
他们通过改善图书馆，

41
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.076
to reform public schools by improving these libraries.
开始了改革公立学校 这项伟大的事业.。

42
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.756
Then they called me up and they said, "Could you make a little contribution?"
然后他们打电话给我说， “你能帮一点忙吗？“

43
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.796
I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?"
我说，“当然可以， 你们想让我做什么？“

44
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.676
And they said, "Well, we want you to be the graphic designer
接着他们说， “我们想让你作为图形设计师

45
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.156
in charge of the whole thing."
来负责整个事情。”

46
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.756
And so I thought, I know what that means. That means I get to design a logo.
我想了想，我明白了， 这意味着我得设计出一个标识。

47
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.230
I know how to design that. I design logos.
我知道怎么做， 我是商标设计师。

48
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.476
That's what people come to me for.
人们找我都是为此而来。

49
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.596
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.
那好吧，那就给 这项活动做个标识。

50
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.876
Easy to do, actually, compared with architecture
相比设计建筑和当管理员，

51
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.156
and being a librarian.
这其实是个简单的活。

52
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.916
Just do a logo, make a contribution, and then you're out,
只需要做个标志，做点贡献， 就可以走人,

53
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.876
and you feel really good about yourself.
而且你会觉得自己很棒。

54
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.676
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel good about myself when I do these favors.
我很棒，我喜欢因为帮忙而 自我感觉良好。

55
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.276
So I thought, let's overdeliver.
所以我想，要不多干一点活吧。

56
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.236
I'm going to give you three logos, all based on this one idea.
我会给你们三个 基于一个想法设计的标识。

57
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.596
So you have three options, pick any of the three.
你们可以从这三个中 任选其一。

58
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.916
They're all great, I said.
它们都很棒，我介绍道。

59
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.156
So the basic idea was these would be new school libraries
基本想法是， 这是新的学校图书馆，

60
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.716
for New York schools,
为“新约克”（纽约）的 学校而设计，

61
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.596
and so the idea is that it's a new thing, a new idea that needs a new name.
所以，这是一个新生事物， 一个需要一个新名称的新点子。

62
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.636
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries,
我不想让人们认为 这些图书馆都十分老旧，

63
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.276
the kind of places that everyone is bored with,
那种每个人都 厌烦的图书馆，

64
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.276
you know, not your grandparents' library.
你懂的，就是老一辈人 那种图书馆，

65
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.756
Don't worry about that at all.
完全不是这样。

66
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.796
This is going to this new, exciting thing,
这会是一个 令人振奋的新事物，

67
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.076
not a boring library.
而不是无聊的图书馆。

68
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.756
So option number one:
所以，方案一：

69
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.796
so instead of thinking of it as a library,
不把这个地方当成图书馆，

70
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.996
think of it as a place where it is like: do talk, do make loud noises.
而是把它当成可以自由谈话、 发出响声的地方。

71
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.036
Right? So no shushing, it's like a shush-free zone.
没人能阻止别人说话， 不会有人说“嘘”。

72
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.236
We're going to call it the Reading Room.
我们会把这个地方叫做阅读室。

73
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.636
That was option number one. OK, option number two.
这是第一个方案。 好了，接下来是第二个。

74
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.076
Option number two was, wait for it,
方案二是，瞧好了，

75
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.356
OWL.
OWL。

76
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.716
I'll meet you at OWL.
我们OWL见。

77
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.036
I'm getting my book from the OWL. Meet you after school down at OWL.
我要去OWL取书。 放学后我在OWL等你。

78
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.396
I like that, right? Now, what does OWL stand for?
我喜欢这个。 OWL是什么意思呢？

79
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.316
Well, it could be One World Library,
事实上，它既可以是“One World Library”（一个世界图书馆），

80
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.956
or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.
也可以是开放(Open)、好奇 (Wonder)、学习(Learn)。

81
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.476
Or it could be -- and I figure librarians could figure out other things it could be
还可以是——我想图书管理员 肯定有别的解释，

82
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.956
because they know about words.
因为他们懂很多词。

83
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.196
So other things, right?
那还有什么呢？

84
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.676
And then look at this. It's like the eye of the owl.
看，它像猫头鹰 (owl)的眼睛。

85
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.396
This is irresistible in my opinion.
我对此难以抗拒。

86
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.630
But there's even another idea.
但是，还有另一个点子。

87
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.116
Option number three.
方案三。

88
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.756
Option number three was based actually on language.
方案三，其实是个文字游戏。

89
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.076
It's the idea that "read" is the past tense of "read,"
灵感来源是，“阅读”的 过去时与“红色”同音，

90
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.956
and they're both spelled the same way.
过去时和现在时的拼写相同。

91
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.916
So why don't we call this place The Red Zone?
所以，我们为何不把这个 地方叫做“红区”呢？

92
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.369
I'll meet you at the Red Zone.
在“红区”见面吧。

93
00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:16.953
Are you Red? Get Red.
你“红”（读书）了吗？ 变“红”（阅读）吧。

94
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.916
I'm well Red.
我“很红”（读了很多书）。

95
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.156
(Laughter)
（笑声）

96
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.516
I really loved this idea,
我很喜欢这个想法，

97
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.876
and I somehow was not focused on the idea
而不知怎的 我没考虑到

98
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.796
that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and I don't know.
图书管理员们，一般都…… 对拼写很在意。

99
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.755
(Laughter)
（笑声）

100
00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.276
But sometimes cleverness is more important than spelling,
但有时创意比拼写正确更重要。

101
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.716
and I thought this would be one of those instances.
我认为眼下就是如此。

102
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.756
So usually when I make these presentations
当我展示自己的设计时，

103
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.556
I say there's just one question and the question should be,
客户一般只会有一个问题， 那就是——

104
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.956
"How can I thank you, Mike?"
“Mike，我要怎样感谢你？”

105
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.596
But in this case, the question was more like,
但这一次，客户的问题却是，

106
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.036
"Um, are you kidding?"
“呃，你在开玩笑吗？”

107
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.756
Because, they said,
他们说，因为

108
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.156
the premise of all this work
这些设计的前提

109
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.316
was that kids were bored with old libraries, musty old libraries.
是孩子们厌倦了 老旧的图书馆，

110
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.556
They were tired of them.
受够了这些。

111
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.916
And instead, they said, these kids have never really seen a library.
然而这些孩子从未 见过真正的图书馆。

112
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.756
The school libraries in these schools
这些学校里的图书馆，

113
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.196
are really so dilapidated, if they're there at all,
都非常破旧， 有的学校甚至没有。

114
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.156
that they haven't bored anyone.
他们连厌倦 的机会都没有。

115
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.156
They haven't even been there to bore anyone at all.
这些图书馆甚至 没有存在过。

116
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.596
So the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name.
所以，我不需要给它 取什么新名字。

117
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.676
Just call it, one last try, a library.
只要叫它“图书馆”就行了，

118
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.916
Right? OK.
就这样。

119
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.796
So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?
所以我想，行吧， 弄点花样？

120
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.036
Exclamation point?
加个感叹号？

121
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.036
Then -- this is because I'm clever --
然后—— 我运用聪明才智——

122
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.596
move that into the "i,"
我把感叹号移动到了I处，

123
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.876
make it red,
把它变成红色。

124
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.076
and there you have it, the Library Initiative.
这样就完成了： “图书馆计划”。

125
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.636
So I thought, mission accomplished, there's your logo.
于是任务完成了， 这就是你们要的标志。

126
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.716
So what's interesting about this logo, an unintended consequence,
有趣的是，这个标识 有一个意外结果。

127
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.876
was that it turned out that they didn't really even need my design
事实证明，客户其实 并不需要我设计什么，

128
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.876
because you could type it any font, you could write it by hand,
因为这个标识可以 用任何字体打印，可以手写，

129
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.996
and when they started sending emails around,
而当他们开始发邮件的时候，

130
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.596
they just would use Shift and 1,
只要在键盘上打个感叹号，

131
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.196
they'd get their own logo just right out of the thing.
就能直接打出自己的标志。

132
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.956
And I thought, well, that's fine.
我想，嗯，行吧。

133
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.756
Feel free to use that logo.
这个标志你们随便用。

134
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.676
And then I embarked on the real rollout of this thing --
然后，我开始真正展示我的设计。

135
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.636
working with every one of the architects
和每一个建筑师合作，

136
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.660
to put this logo on the front door of their own library. Right?
把这个标识放在图书馆门上。

137
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.556
So here's the big rollout.
事情是这样的。

138
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.836
Basically I'd work with different architects.
我需要和不同建筑师合作。

139
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.076
First Robin Hood was my client. Now these architects were my client.
原本罗宾汉是我的客户， 现在建筑师们是我的客户。

140
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.339
I'd say, "Here's your logo. Put it on the door."
我会说：“这是你的标志。 把它放在门上。”

141
00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:13.316
"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."
“这是你的标志。把它放在两扇门上。”

142
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.356
"Here's your logo. Put it off to the side."
“这是你的标志。把它放在边上。”

143
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.636
"Here's your logo repeated all over to the top."
“这是你的标志。在顶上把它重复放。”

144
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.356
So everything was going swimmingly.
所以每件事都做的挺快。

145
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.036
I just was saying, "Here's your logo. Here's your logo."
我只是说，“这是你的标志。这是你的标志。”

146
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.196
Then I got a call from one of the architects,
然后，我接到了一个建筑师的电话，

147
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.076
a guy named Richard Lewis, and he says, "I've got a problem.
他叫理查德·路易斯， 他说：“我遇到了个麻烦。

148
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.116
You're the graphics guy. Can you solve it?"
你是负责图像设计的。 能帮个忙吗？

149
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.356
And I said, OK, sure."
我说，“当然可以。”

150
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.956
And he said, "The problem is that there's a space
他说：“书架和天花板之间

151
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.796
between the shelf and the ceiling."
有一个空档。”

152
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.156
So that sounds like an architectural issue to me,
对我来说这听起来像 建筑问题，

153
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.276
not a graphic design issue, so I'm, "Go on."
而不是图像设计问题。 我说：“继续。”

154
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.956
And Richard says, "Well, the top shelf has to be low enough
他说：“最高的书架必须低到

155
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.196
for the kid to reach it,
孩子们能够得到，

156
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.220
but I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings are really high,
但在老楼房里天花板很高，

157
00:06:47.244 --> 00:06:49.316
so actually I've got all this space up there
所以有一块很大的空白，

158
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.036
and I need something like a mural."
我需要弄些壁画。”

159
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.996
And I'm like, "Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer.
我说：“啊？我是商标设计师，

160
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.156
I'm not Diego Rivera or something.
不是画家。

161
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.796
I'm not a muralist."
我不会壁画。”

162
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.196
And so he said, "But can't you think of anything?"
他说：“但你不能想点什么吗？”

163
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.596
So I said, "OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school
我说：“行，如果给孩子拍点照片，

164
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.076
and just put them around the top of the thing,
然后放在书架上方，

165
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.436
and maybe that could work."
或许就搞定了。”

166
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.316
And my wife is a photographer,
我夫人是摄影师，

167
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.276
and I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,
我告诉她：“多罗西，这没有预算，

168
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.476
can you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures?"
你能到纽约东边的这个学校拍点照吗？”

169
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.716
And she did,
她去了，

170
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.716
and if you go in Richard's library,
而如果你到了那个图书馆，

171
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.596
which is one of the first that opened,
这批图书馆第一个开放的，

172
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.716
it has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school,

173
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.436
oversized, looking down

174
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.476
into the little dollhouse of the real library, right?
下面的小小图书馆。

175
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.316
And the kids were great, hand-selected by the principals
这些孩子都很好， 由校长和图书管理员

176
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.116
and the librarian.
亲自挑选。

177
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.396
It just kind of created this heroic atmosphere in this library,
这就使得图书馆有种英雄气氛，

178
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.916
this very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above.
下面是庄严的气氛， 上面是欢快的孩子们。

179
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.276
So naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this
后来其他学校的图书馆员看到了，

180
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.236
and they said, well, we want murals too.

181
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.556
And I'm like, OK.
我想，好吧。

182
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.476
So then I think, well, it can't be the same mural every time,
但这不能每次都一样，

183
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.556
so Dorothy did another one, and then she did another one,
所以多罗西拍了照片 给另外两个图书馆，

184
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.196
but then we needed more help,

185
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.076
so I called an illustrator I knew named Lynn Pauley,

and Lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids.

So this was really satisfying,

Every once in a while,

and it would say, "You are invited to the opening of our new library."
邀请我去参加图书馆的开馆大会。

220
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.876

我会站在那，穿着正装， 显得格格不入，

229
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.927
and someone would say, "What are you doing here, mister?"
然后有人问我， “你为什么来这里？”

"Yeah, I did that!"

and drive around the five boroughs of New York

and see how many we could hit at one time.

And the best thing of all was meeting these librarians

remember, it was just about designing that logo
