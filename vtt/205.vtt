1
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.851
You've heard of your IQ, your general intelligence,
你一定听说过智商， 也就是普通智力，

2
00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.565
but what's your Psy-Q?
但什么是心理商？

3
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.795
How much do you know about what makes you tick,
你对自己的行为和性格了解多少，

4
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.578
and how good are you at predicting other people's behavior
你能准确地预测他人行为，

5
00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:23.847
or even your own?
或你自己的行为吗？

6
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.996
And how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong?
你对心理学的认知 有多少是错的？

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.370
Let's find out by counting down the top myths of psychology.
让我们来了解一下心理学中 几个主要的错误观念。

8
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.282
You've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology,
你可能听过这本书，里面的观点做了

9
00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:36.364
it's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
男人来自火星， 女人来自金星的比喻。

10
00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:38.553
But how different are men and women, really?
但男人和女人间 究竟有多大的差异？

11
00:00:38.553 --> 00:00:41.106
To find out, let's start by looking at something
为了找到答案，让我们看看男女

12
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.556
on which men and women really do differ
在哪些方面存在明显的差别，

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.857
and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale.
然后再把这些心理学上的性别差异 在同一张图上表现出来。

14
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.912
One thing men and women do really differ on
那么男女差异的其中一项是

15
00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:50.517
is how far they can throw a ball.
扔球距离的远近。

16
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.434
So if we look at the data for men here,
先看一下男性的数据。

17
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:54.925
we see what is called a normal distribution curve.
我们看到一条所谓的 标准分布曲线。

18
00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.035
A few men can throw a ball really far, a few men, not far at all,
有些男性可以把球扔很远， 有些男性却稍逊一点，

19
00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.805
but most, a kind of average distance.
但大多数都在平均距离附近。

20
00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:02.043
And women share the same distribution as well,
女性的表现也呈现了 相同的分布曲线，

21
00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:03.552
but actually, there's quite a big difference.
但实际上却存在相当大的差异。

22
00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:06.003
In fact, the average man can throw a ball further
事实上，男性平均来说 可以把球扔得更远，

23
00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:08.416
than about 98 percent of all women.
超过了98％的女性。

24
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.866
Now let's look at what some psychological gender differences look like
那么现在我们来看看 男女在心理上的一些差别，

25
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.399
on the same standardized scale.
还是以同样的标准来比较。

26
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.886
Any psychologist will tell you
任何心理学家都会告诉你

27
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.481
that men are better at spatial awareness than women --
男人比女人的空间感更好——

28
00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:21.086
things like map-reading, for example -- and it's true.
例如阅读地图——这的确是事实，

29
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.327
But let's have a look at the size of this difference.
不过让我们看看 这种差异到底有多大。

30
00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:26.794
It's tiny; the lines are so close together, they almost overlap.
差异非常小, 两条曲线 如此接近，近乎重叠。

31
00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:30.622
In fact, the average woman is better than 33 percent of all men,
事实上，女性平均来说比 33％的男性的表现要好，

32
00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.758
and of course, if that was 50 percent,
当然，如果这百分比是50％，

33
00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:34.993
then the two genders would be exactly equal.
那么，男性和女性的表现 就是完全相同的。

34
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.112
It's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you
请记住这种差异， 我马上要说的下一个例子

35
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.825
are pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences
几乎是心理学迄今为止发现的

36
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:42.822
ever discovered in psychology.
男女心理上的最大差异。

37
00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:43.878
Here's the next one.
就是这个。

38
00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:45.387
Any psychologist will tell you
任何心理学家都会告诉你

39
00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:48.106
that women are better with language and grammar than men.
女性在语言和语法方面比男性更好。

40
00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:51.267
Here's performance on the standardized grammar test.
这种差异表现在标准化语法测试上。

41
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.385
There, the women. There go the men.
这是女性曲线（紫色）， 这是男性曲线（青色）。

42
00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:54.589
Again, yes, women are better on average,
没错，平均来说女性的表现的确更好，

43
00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.236
but the lines are so close
但两条曲线依然很接近，

44
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.318
that 33 percent of men are better than the average woman.
33％的男性表现超过了女性平均值，

45
00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:00.942
And again, if it was 50 percent,
同样，如果这百分比是50％，

46
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:03.743
that would represent complete gender equality.
那就意味着两个性别间并不存在差异。

47
00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.244
So it's not really a case of Mars and Venus.
因此，这不是火星和金星的对比，

48
00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:08.817
It's more a case of, if anything, Mars and Snickers:
它更像巧克力棒Mars 和Snickers的差别，

49
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:12.506
basically the same, but one's maybe slightly nuttier than the other.
二者基本相同，但一种 可能比另一种的坚果更多。

50
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.296
When making a cake, do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures?
下面请做蛋糕的时候更习惯使用 带图片的食谱书的观众举起手。

51
00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:18.271
Yeah, a few people.
好的，有一些人举手了。

52
00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:20.053
Have a friend talk you through?
哪些人需要朋友的指导？

53
00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:23.086
Or have a go, making it up as you go along?
有没有人会自己尝试去凑合做一个？

54
00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:25.096
Quite a few people there.
还是有不少人举手了。

55
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.648
OK, so if you said A,
好的，如果你选了A，

56
00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.159
then this means that you're a visual learner,
这意味着你是一个视觉学习者，

57
00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:32.454
and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style.
当信息以视觉的形式呈现， 你的学习效果最好。

58
00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.128
If you said B, it means you're an auditory learner,
如果你选B，这说明 你是一个听觉学习者，

59
00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:38.926
that you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format.
通过听觉信息可以达到 最好的学习效果。

60
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.857
And if you said C, it means that you're a kinesthetic learner,
如果你选C，这意味者 你是一个动觉学习者，

61
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.270
that you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands.
直接动手实践会学得最快。

62
00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.680
Except, of course, as you've probably guessed,
当然你可能已经猜到，

63
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.612
that it doesn't, because the whole thing is a complete myth.
这样的结论不太可靠，因为 整个学习过程要比这复杂得多。

64
00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:54.226
Learning styles are made up and are not supported by scientific evidence.
这种学习方式只是人为定义的， 并没有科学证据的支持。

65
00:02:54.102 --> 00:02:57.522
We know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies
我们了解到这些，是因为 在严格对照的实验研究里，

66
00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.716
when learners are given material to learn,
给学习者提供的学习资料

67
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.369
either in their preferred style or an opposite style,
要么是他们喜欢的学习方式， 要么就是他们不喜欢的，

68
00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:06.058
it makes no difference at all to the amount of information they retain.
事实证明，他们所掌握的 信息数量完全没有区别。

69
00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:08.148
And if you think about it for just a second,
如果你仔细思考一下，

70
00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:09.843
it's obvious that this has to be true.
很明显，这是毋庸置疑的。

71
00:03:09.843 --> 00:03:14.457
It's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you,
最好的呈现方式并不取决于你，

72
00:03:14.453 --> 00:03:16.143
but on what you're trying to learn.
而取决于你尝试学习的东西。

73
00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.623
Could you learn to drive a car, for example, just by listening to someone
例如，你学开车的时候，只是通过

74
00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:20.819
telling you what to do,
听别人口头传授，

75
00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:22.328
with no kinesthetic experience?
而不需要任何动觉的经验吗？

76
00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:25.977
Could you solve simultaneous equations by talking them through in your head,
你在解联立方程的时候， 只是通过单纯的大脑思考，

77
00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:27.091
without writing them down?
而不用把它们写下来吗？

78
00:03:27.298 --> 00:03:30.577
Could you revise for your architecture exams using interpretive dance
如果你是一个动觉学习者， 在复习建筑学考试的时候

79
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:32.148
if you're a kinesthetic learner?
能使用诠释性的舞蹈吗？

80
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.692
No; what you need to do is match the material to be learned
当然不行，你需要做的 是将需要学习的材料

81
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.298
to the presentation format,
与它表现的形式相匹配，

82
00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:37.639
not you.
而不是与你习惯的方式。

83
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.720
I know many of you are A-level students
我知道许多在座的人是优等生，

84
00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:43.035
that will have recently gotten your GCSE results.
最近刚拿到你的GCSE （中等教育普通证书）的结果。

85
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.310
And if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for,
如果你没有得到预期的成绩，

86
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.852
then you can't really blame your learning style.
你真的不能责怪你的学习方式，

87
00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:51.311
But one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes.
但你也许可以考虑责怪的 事情之一就是你的基因。

88
00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:55.234
So what this is all about is that a recent study at University College London
伦敦大学学院最近做了一项研究，

89
00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:59.387
found that 58 percent of the variation between different students
发现在不同学生和他们的

90
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.932
and their GCSE results
GCSE成绩之间

91
00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:02.710
was down to genetic factors.
有58%的差异来自遗传因素。

92
00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:06.031
That sounds like a very precise figure. So how can we tell?
这听起来是一个精确的数字， 我们是怎么得到它的呢？

93
00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:09.261
Well, when we want to unpack the relative contributions
当我们想解开关于基因和环境

94
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:11.401
of genes and the environment,
在这方面的影响问题，

95
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:13.432
what we can do is a twin study.
我们可以做双胞胎研究。

96
00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:17.135
Identical twins share 100 percent of their environment
同卵双胞胎有完全相同的生长环境

97
00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.206
and 100 percent of their genes,
以及完全相同的基因，

98
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.676
whereas nonidentical twins share 100 percent of their environment,
然而，异卵双胞胎 有完全相同的生长环境，

99
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.250
but just like any brother and sister, share only 50 percent of their genes.
但像任何兄弟姐妹一样， 只有一半的基因相同。

100
00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:30.565
So by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins
因此，通过比较同卵双胞胎 与异卵双胞胎的

101
00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:32.660
versus nonidentical twins
GCSE成绩，

102
00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:34.060
and doing some clever maths,
做一些巧妙的计算后，

103
00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:38.029
we can get an idea of how much variation in performance is due to the environment,
我们就可以知道有多少 表现的差异来自环境，

104
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.762
and how much is due to genes.
有多少是受基因的影响。

105
00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:43.210
And it turns out that it's about 58 percent due to genes.
而结果证明，约58％的 差异是基因导致的。

106
00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:47.729
This isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in.
所以，并不是说你和老师们的 辛苦付出没起到什么作用。

107
00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.892
If you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for,
如果你没有得到预期的GCSE成绩，

108
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:53.038
then you can always try blaming your parents,
那么你可以尝试去埋怨你的父母，

109
00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:54.612
or at least their genes.
或至少他们的基因。

110
00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.857
One thing that you shouldn't blame
有一件你不应该去埋怨的事情，

111
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:59.429
is being a left-brained or right-brained learner,
是关于左脑学习者或右脑学习者，

112
00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:01.389
because again, this is a myth.
因为，这同样也是个错误观念。

113
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:04.680
The myth here is that the left brain is logical,
它的主要观点是， 左脑是主管逻辑，

114
00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.393
it's good with equations like this,
擅于解方程式，

115
00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:10.049
and the right brain is more creative, so the right brain is better at music.
而右脑更富有创意， 在音乐方面表现更佳。

116
00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.835
But again, this is a myth,
但同样，这是一个错误观念，

117
00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:12.901
because nearly everything you do
因为你所做的每件事情

118
00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.636
involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together,
几乎都牵涉到你大脑 所有部位的相互沟通，

119
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.956
even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation.
就算是最平凡的日常对话也是如此。

120
00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:22.389
However, perhaps one reason why this myth has survived
然而，这个错误观念至今 仍然盛行的一个原因可能是，

121
00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:24.781
is that there is a slight grain of truth to it.
这里包含着小部分事实。

122
00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:28.540
A related version of the myth is that left-handed people are more creative
它的另一个说法是，左撇子比右撇子

123
00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:29.813
than right-handed people,
更有创造力，

124
00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:33.270
which kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hand.
这种说法有点道理， 因为你的大脑控制相反的手，

125
00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:36.601
So in left-handed people, the right side of the brain is slightly more active
因此，左撇子的右脑比左脑

126
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:37.943
than the left side of the brain,
更加活跃一点，

127
00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.155
and the idea is the right-hand side is more creative.
而恰恰是右脑更有创造力。

128
00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:44.585
Now, it isn't true per se that left-handed people are more creative
然而，这个左撇子比右撇子 更有创造力的观念

129
00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:45.860
than right-handed people.
本身并不太站得住脚。

130
00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:48.174
But what is true is that ambidextrous people,
事实上，双手灵巧的人

131
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.860
or people who use both hands for different tasks,
或两手并用的人，

132
00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:54.639
are more creative thinkers than one-handed people,
比单手使用者更富有创意，

133
00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:56.430
because being ambidextrous involves
因为双手使用者需要

134
00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:59.146
having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot,
让大脑两侧进行 大量的互动和沟通，

135
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.926
which seems to be involved in creative and flexible thinking.
这似乎与有创造性， 灵活的思维相关。

136
00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:05.764
The myth of the creative left-hander arises from the fact
左撇子更有创意的错误观念

137
00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:08.651
that being ambidextrous is more common amongst left-handers
源自善用双手者 在左撇子中比右撇子中

138
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:09.830
than right-handers,
更常见这一事实，

139
00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:12.960
so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left-hander,
所以说，左撇子更有创意 这个说法有些道理，

140
00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:14.247
but not much.
但并不完全正确。

141
00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:16.878
A related myth that you've probably heard of
另一个相关的错误观念你或许听过，

142
00:06:16.902 --> 00:06:19.194
is that we only use 10 percent of our brains.
我们开发了大脑的10％的潜能。

143
00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:20.794
This is, again, a complete myth.
这也是一个完全错误的观念。

144
00:06:20.818 --> 00:06:23.558
Nearly everything that we do, even the most mundane thing,
我们所做的每件事情， 即使是最平凡的小事，

145
00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:25.434
uses nearly all of our brains.
都会使用到几乎整个大脑。

146
00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:29.054
That said, it is of course true
然而，我们大多数人不能

147
00:06:29.078 --> 00:06:33.634
that most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could.
有效地运用大脑的说法的确是真的。

148
00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.548
So what could we do to boost our brainpower?
那么我们要怎样 充分调动大脑的潜能呢？

149
00:06:36.572 --> 00:06:38.827
Maybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart.
或许我们可以听一段莫扎特的音乐。

150
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:41.456
Have you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect?
你们听说过莫扎特效应吗？

151
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.413
The idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter
它说的是听莫扎特的音乐 会使你更聪明，

152
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.997
and improves your performance on IQ tests.
并能提升你在智商测验中的表现。

153
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.432
Now again, what's interesting about this myth
它的有趣之处在于，

154
00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:52.272
is that although it's basically a myth, there is a grain of truth to it.
虽然这基本上也是个错误观念， 但多少也有些可取之处。

155
00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.152
So the original study found that
最初的研究发现

156
00:06:54.928 --> 00:06:58.322
participants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes
听过几分钟莫扎特音乐的参与者

157
00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:00.220
did better on a subsequent IQ test
在随后的智商测验中的表现

158
00:07:00.244 --> 00:07:03.395
than participants who simply sat in silence.
比只是静静坐着的参与者要好。

159
00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.456
But a follow-up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music
但一项后续研究，招募了 一些喜欢莫扎特音乐的人

160
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.037
and then another group of people
以及另外一组

161
00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:11.547
who were fans of the horror stories of Stephen King.
喜欢Stephen King的恐怖故事的人。

162
00:07:11.592 --> 00:07:15.311
And they played the people the music or the stories.
参与者都需要听音乐或听故事。

163
00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:17.820
The people who preferred Mozart music to the stories
更喜欢听莫扎特音乐的人 比爱听故事的人

164
00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:20.627
got a bigger IQ boost from the Mozart than the stories,
在听过莫扎特音乐后 表现出了更高的智商，

165
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:23.488
but the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music
但对于更喜欢听故事的人来说，

166
00:07:23.512 --> 00:07:26.646
got a bigger IQ boost from listening to the Stephen King stories
听Stephen King的故事， 相比听莫扎特的音乐，会让他们的智商

167
00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.526
than the Mozart music.
呈现更显著的增长。

168
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.628
So the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy
那么事实就是， 当你在听喜欢的东西时，

169
00:07:30.652 --> 00:07:33.793
perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary IQ boost
会使你振作一点， 让你在有限的工作中

170
00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:35.472
on a narrow range of tasks.
会表现出暂时的智商增长。

171
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.840
There's no suggestion that listening to Mozart,
不过并没有证据表明听莫扎特音乐，

172
00:07:37.864 --> 00:07:39.465
or indeed Stephen King stories,
或听Stephen King的故事

173
00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:42.575
is going to make you any smarter in the long run.
会让你彻底变得更聪明。

174
00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:45.733
Another version of the Mozart myth
另一个关于莫扎特的错误观念

175
00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:50.806
is that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier, too.
是听莫扎特音乐，不仅 让你变聪明，而且会更健康。

176
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:53.385
Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be true
可惜的是，这对于几乎每天听

177
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:56.295
of someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day,
莫扎特音乐的人来说， 并不是那么回事儿。

178
00:07:56.454 --> 00:07:57.616
Mozart himself,
莫扎特本身就曾饱受

179
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.795
who suffered from gonorrhea, smallpox, arthritis,
淋病，天花，关节炎的折磨，

180
00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.885
and, what most people think eventually killed him in the end, syphilis.
不过人们认为最终 导致他死亡的是梅毒。

181
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:09.066
This suggests that Mozart should have been a bit more careful, perhaps,
这表示，也许莫扎特在 选择他的性伴侣时

182
00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:10.516
when choosing his sexual partners.
应该要更小心。

183
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.133
But how do we choose a partner?
但是，我们该如何选择另一半呢？

184
00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:18.416
So a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists
还有一个时常被 社会学家提到的观念，

185
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.984
is that our preferences in a romantic partner are a product of our culture,
那就是我们对于恋爱对象的偏好 是一种文化下的产物，

186
00:08:22.008 --> 00:08:23.871
that they're very culturally specific.
具有文化特定性。

187
00:08:23.895 --> 00:08:26.146
But in fact, the data don't back this up.
但实际上，数据分析的结果 并不支持这种看法。

188
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.221
A famous study surveyed people from [37] different cultures across the globe
有一项知名的研究，对来自全球37个 不同文化背景的人进行了调查，

189
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:31.660
from Americans to Zulus,
从美洲人到南非祖鲁部落人，

190
00:08:31.684 --> 00:08:33.716
on what they look for in a partner.
关于他们如何择偶。

191
00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.265
And in every single culture across the globe,
而在全世界任何一个文化中，

192
00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.166
men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner
男性都会比女性更多的注重

193
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.356
than did women,
另一半的外表，

194
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.969
and in every single culture, too,
同样在任何一个文化中，

195
00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:47.815
women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power.
女性都比男性更重视 另一半的事业心和经济能力。

196
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:49.077
In every culture, too,
另外，在任何一个文化中，

197
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.616
men preferred women who were younger than themselves,
男性更喜欢比自己年轻的女性，

198
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.637
an average of, I think it was 2.66 years.
我记得平均要年轻2.66岁，

199
00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:56.110
And in every culture, too,
同样在任何文化中，

200
00:08:56.134 --> 00:08:58.719
women preferred men who were older than them,
女性都更喜欢比她们年纪大的男性，

201
00:08:58.743 --> 00:09:01.486
so an average of 3.42 years,
平均年长3.42岁，

202
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.623
which is why we've got here, "Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."
这就是为什么人们常说 “每个人（女性）都需要傍大款。”

203
00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:05.647
(Laughter)
（笑声）

204
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.970
So moving on from trying to score with a partner
那么，把话题从找到理想伴侣转到

205
00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:11.657
to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is.
如何在篮球或足球等运动中得分吧。

206
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:15.813
The myth here is that sportsmen go through "hot hand" streaks, Americans call them,
这个说法是，运动员会经历 美国人称为的热手时期，

207
00:09:15.837 --> 00:09:18.141
or "purple patches," we sometimes say in England,
或英国人说的紫色时期，

208
00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:20.673
where they just can't miss, like this guy here.
像这家伙一样，在球场上百发百中。

209
00:09:20.697 --> 00:09:24.583
But in fact, what happens is that if you analyze the pattern
但事实上，如果你对这些得分和丢分

210
00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:26.226
of hits and misses statistically,
进行统计分析，

211
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.681
it turns out that it's nearly always at random.
你会发现这几乎都是随机的。

212
00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:31.050
Your brain creates patterns from the randomness.
你的大脑会从 随机事件中总结出规律。

213
00:09:30.976 --> 00:09:32.541
If you toss a coin,
比如你抛硬币，

214
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:36.413
a streak of heads or tails is going to come out somewhere in the randomness,
会随机出现正面或反面两种可能，

215
00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:39.570
and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none,
因为大脑喜欢从随机中找出模式来，

216
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.583
we look at these streaks and attribute meaning to them
我们会为这些随机事件 人为加上某种意义，

217
00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:43.470
and say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"
说：“是啊，他今天状态很好。”

218
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.375
whereas actually you would get the same pattern
但如果你只是随机的得分和丢分，

219
00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.584
if you were just getting hits and misses at random.
实际上还是会获得 相同的数据分布模式。

220
00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:53.565
An exception to this, however, is penalty shootouts.
但是罚球是一个例外。

221
00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:56.510
A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football
最近一项关于足球运动中 罚点球的研究发现，

222
00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:58.628
showed that players who represent countries
那些罚点球记录很糟糕的

223
00:09:58.652 --> 00:10:00.962
with a very bad record in penalty shootouts,
国家队中的球员，

224
00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:03.145
like, for example, England,
例如，在英国队，

225
00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:07.056
tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record,
相比罚球记录较好国家的球员 更急于射门得分，

226
00:10:06.882 --> 00:10:10.685
and presumably as a result, they're more likely to miss.
结果看起来就好像 他们比较容易罚球失误。

227
00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:12.530
Which raises the question
这又带出了一个问题，

228
00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:15.583
of if there's any way we could improve people's performance.
有什么方法可以改善人们的表现。

229
00:10:15.607 --> 00:10:17.583
And one thing you might think about doing
你可能会想做这样一件事，

230
00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:20.992
is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them.
惩罚有失误的人，看这样 是否能提高他们表现。

231
00:10:20.943 --> 00:10:24.543
This idea, the effect that punishment can improve performance,
这个关于惩罚可以提升表现的看法，

232
00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:26.791
was what participants thought they were testing
正是Milgram著名的 学习和惩罚实验中的

233
00:10:26.815 --> 00:10:29.415
in Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment
参与者认为他们所测试的对象，

234
00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:32.447
that you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student.
如果你是一个心理学系的学生， 你可能听说过这个实验。

235
00:10:32.471 --> 00:10:35.014
The story goes that participants were prepared to give
具体过程是这样的， 当一部分参与者答错了问题时，

236
00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:38.287
what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant
另一部分参与者就要对他们实施

237
00:10:38.358 --> 00:10:40.395
when they got a question wrong,
提前被告知会致命的电击，

238
00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:43.150
just because someone in a white coat told them to.
就因为某个穿着白大褂的人 告诉他们这样做。

239
00:10:43.174 --> 00:10:45.473
But this story is a myth for three reasons.
但这个故事疑点重重，原因有三个。

240
00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:50.377
Firstly, and most crucially, the lab coat wasn't white. It was, in fact, grey.
第一个，也是最关键的， 实验外套不是白色，而是灰色。

241
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:55.138
Secondly, the participants were told before the study
其次，在研究进行之前， 参与者会被告知

242
00:10:55.162 --> 00:10:57.505
and reminded any time they raised a concern,
并在实验中一直被提醒，

243
00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.248
that although the shocks were painful, they were not fatal
虽然电击会引起疼痛， 但并不是致命的，

244
00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:03.228
and indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever.
也不会引起永久的伤害，等等。

245
00:11:03.252 --> 00:11:05.618
And thirdly, participants didn't give the shocks
第三，参与者没有因为穿实验服的人

246
00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:08.440
just because someone in the coat told them to.
让他们实施电击，就真的这样做了。

247
00:11:08.464 --> 00:11:10.469
When they were interviewed after the study,
在实验结束后的采访中，

248
00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.470
all the participants said that they firmly believed
所有参与者都说，他们坚定地认为

249
00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:16.457
that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose
学习和惩罚的研究很有科学价值，

250
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.606
which would have enduring gains for science,
虽然会给予参与者短暂的， 非致命的不适感，

251
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.773
as opposed to the momentary, nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants.
但能让科学领域获得长远的收获。

252
00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:28.539
OK, so I've been talking for about 12 minutes now,
好了，我已经讲了差不多12分钟，

253
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.152
and you've probably been sitting there listening to me,
你们可能一直在那里听我讲，

254
00:11:30.873 --> 00:11:32.819
analyzing my speech patterns and body language
分析我讲话的模式和身体语言，

255
00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.552
and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying,
并试图记住我说过的一些话，

256
00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:39.320
whether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying.
并分辨它们究竟是事实， 还是我在撒谎，

257
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:41.432
But if so, you've probably completely failed,
如果你这样做的话， 你大概没得出什么正确结论，

258
00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:43.800
because although we all think we can catch a liar
因为，虽然我们认为， 能够通过身体语言和说话方式

259
00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:46.002
from their body language and speech patterns,
来判断一个人是不是在说谎，

260
00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:48.820
hundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown that all of us,
但是多年来的数百个 心理学研究却发现我们所有的人，

261
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.922
including police officers and detectives,
包括警察和侦探，

262
00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:54.206
are basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language
当想要透过说话者的身体语言 和说话方式来测谎时，

263
00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:55.929
and verbal patterns.
其实都是在碰运气。

264
00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:58.177
Interestingly, there is one exception:
有趣的是，有一个例外：

265
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.299
TV appeals for missing relatives.
当电视上有人呼吁寻找失踪的亲人，

266
00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:03.438
It's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing
我们很容易就能判断 亲人是真的失踪了，

267
00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:06.891
and when the appealers have, in fact, murdered the relatives themselves.
还是发出呼吁的人 已经谋杀了自己的亲人。

268
00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:10.457
So hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads, to look away,
说谎的呼吁者更可能 会摇头，目光游移不定，

269
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:12.184
and to make errors in their speech,
而且他们的言辞中错误频频；

270
00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:14.889
whereas genuine appealers are more likely to express hope
相反，真正的呼吁人通常

271
00:12:14.913 --> 00:12:16.553
that the person will return safely
更会表达对失踪者安全归来的期待，

272
00:12:16.577 --> 00:12:17.996
and to avoid brutal language.
并避免使用极端的语言。

273
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.502
So, for example, they might say "taken from us" rather than "killed."
例如，他们可能会说 “离开了我们”，而不是“被杀害了”。

274
00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:25.437
Speaking of which, it's about time I killed this talk,
说到这里，差不多 该结束这次演讲了，

the overarching myth of psychology.

The myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories,
这个观念是，心理学 只是对有趣理论的收集，

What I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes

What we need to do is assess psychological theories

282

by seeing what predictions they make,

whether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter,

that you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style

287
00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:02.020
and the only way we can make progress

288
00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:03.886
is to test these predictions against the data

in tightly controlled experimental studies.
