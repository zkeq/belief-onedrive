It was a cold, sunny March day.

2
00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:19.695
I was walking along the street in Riga.

3
00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:23.862
I remember the winter was slowly coming to an end.

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:26.633
There was still some snow around here and there,

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:29.647
but the pavement was already clear and dry.

6
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.216
If you've lived in Riga,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.615
you will know that feeling of relief that the first signs of spring bring,
你就能体会到春天的第一个迹象带来的那种轻松感，

8
00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:41.048
and you no longer have to trudge through that slushy mix of snow and mud on the streets.
并且你再也不用在遍布积雪的泥泞街道上跋涉了。

9
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:45.082
So there I am, enjoying my stroll,
那天，我走在街上，享受着闲庭信步，

10
00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:50.495
as I suddenly notice a stencil on the pavement in front of me,
突然注意到前面地砖上的一块图案，

11
00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:51.704

15
00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:06.958
The question stopped me in my tracks.

16
00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.609
As I'm standing there considering its meaning,
于是，我站在原地，开始思考着它的含义。

17
00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:16.784
I notice I'm standing outside the Riga Municipality Social Welfare Department.
我注意到自己正站在里加市社会福利部外面。

18
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.310
So it appears that the author of this graffiti, whoever it is,
似乎这个涂鸦的作者——不管他是谁——

19
00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:25.935
is asking this question to people coming to apply for social assistance.

20
00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.123
That winter,

21
00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:34.539
I had been doing research on the aftermath of the financial crisis in Latvia.
我一直在研究拉脱维亚金融危机的后果。

the Latvian government chose a strategy of internal devaluation.

My mother had been working as a history teacher her whole life.

紧缩就意味着，突然之间她的薪水减少了 30%。

32
00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:15.593
And there were many in a situation like hers or worse.
很多人的情况跟她相似或者更糟。

33
00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:20.350
The costs of the crisis were put on the shoulders of ordinary Latvians.

Only Greece suffered an economic contraction of a comparable scale.

37
00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:38.911
Yet, while Greeks were out in the streets for months

staging continuous, often violent protests in Athens,

all was quiet in Riga.

40
00:02:47.324 --> 00:02:51.038
Prominent economists were fighting in the columns of "The New York Times"

41
00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:56.894

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:09.560
and how it was spreading from city to city,

47
00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:11.713
from Madrid to New York to London,

50
00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:18.711
Yet when I arrived in Riga,

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:21.103
there were no echoes of the Occupy here.
这里没有一丁点“占领”的迹象。

52
00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:23.967
Latvians were just putting up with it.
拉脱维亚人已经接受了这个事实。

53
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.896
They "swallowed the toad," as the local saying goes.
正如当地谚语所说，他们“吞下了癞蛤蟆（自食苦果）”。

54
00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:31.784
For my doctoral research,
为了我的博士研究，

55
00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:38.008
I wanted to study how the state-citizen relationship was changing in Latvia in the post-Soviet era,
我想去研究后苏联时代拉脱维亚的国家与公民关系发生了怎样的变化，

56
00:03:38.032 --> 00:03:41.823
and I had chosen the unemployment office as my research site.
我选择了失业办公室作为我的研究地点。

57
00:03:42.374 --> 00:03:45.833
And as I arrived there in that autumn of 2011,
当我在 2011 年秋天到达那里时，

58
00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:49.653
I realized, "I am actually witnessing firsthand
我意识到：“我其实是在亲自见证

59
00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:52.224
how the effects of crises are playing out,
危机是如何产生影响的，

60
00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:57.871
and how those worst affected by it, people who have lost their jobs, are reacting to it."
以及那些受影响最严重的人，那些失去工作的人是如何响应的。”

61
00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:04.411
So I started interviewing people I met at the unemployment office.
于是我开始采访我在失业办公室遇到的人。

62
00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:10.488
They were all registered as job seekers and hoping for some help from the state.
他们都是注册的失业者，希望得到国家的帮助。

63
00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:15.001
Yet, as I was soon discovering, this help was of a particular kind.
然而，我很快发现，这是种特殊的帮助。

64
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:16.577
There was some cash benefit,
会有一些现金补助，

65
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:21.109
but mostly state assistance came in the form of various social programs,

66
00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:23.567
and one of the biggest of these programs was called

67
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.040
"Competitiveness-Raising Activities."
“竞争力提升活动”。

68
00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.750
It was, in essence, a series of seminars that all of the unemployed were encouraged to attend.
从本质上说，这是一系列鼓励失业者去参与的研讨会。

69
00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:34.664
So I started attending these seminars with them.
于是我开始和他们一起参与这些研讨会。

70
00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:38.447
And a number of paradoxes struck me.
然而，有一些悖论开始困扰着我。

71
00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:40.352
So, imagine:

72
00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:44.094
the crisis is still ongoing,
危机仍在继续，

73
00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:46.232
the Latvian economy is contracting,
拉脱维亚经济正在萎缩，

74
00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:48.336
hardly anyone is hiring,
人才市场一片萧条，

75
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.849
and there we are,
而就在这个

76
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.896
in this small, brightly lit classroom,

77
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.178
a group of 15 people,

00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:59.808
working on lists of our personal strengths and weaknesses, our inner demons,

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:04.511
that we are told are preventing us from being more successful in the labor market.

and the costs of this bailout are shifted onto the shoulders of the population,

83
00:05:18.513 --> 00:05:20.377
when feeling stressed.

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:27.536
As home mortgages are being foreclosed

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.112
and thousands of people are emigrating,

87
00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:33.935
we are told to dream big and to follow our dreams.

88
00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:36.509
As a sociologist,
作为社会学家，

89
00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:43.000
I know that social policies are an important form of communication between the state and the citizen.

90
00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:45.318
The message of this program was,

91
00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:47.532
to put it in the words of one of the trainers,
用一个培训者的话来说就是，

92
00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:48.722
"Just do it."
“只管去做。”

93
00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:50.589
She was, of course, citing Nike.
显然，她是在引用耐克的广告词。

94
00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:55.442
So symbolically, the state was sending a message to people out of work
所以象征性的，国家给失业者传递的信息是，

95
00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:59.163
that you need to be more active, you need to work harder,
你需要更加积极，你需要更为努力，

00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:02.462
you need to work on yourself, you need to overcome your inner demons,

00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:08.229
that somehow, being out of work was their own personal failure.
失业多多少少也是他们个人的失败。

99
00:06:08.858 --> 00:06:11.436
The suffering of the crisis
这场危机的痛苦

100
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.759
was treated as this individual experience of stress to be managed in one's own body through deep and mindful breathing.
被视作可以被个人的身体通过深度而专注的呼吸来管理的个人经历。

101
00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.840
These types of social programs that emphasize individual responsibility
这些强调个人责任的社会项目

102
00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:28.915
have become increasingly common across the world.
在全球变得日渐普遍。

103
00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.696
They are part of the rise of what sociologist Loïc Wacquant calls
部分是因为社会学家华康德（Loïc Wacquant）所提出的

104
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.513
the "neoliberal Centaur state."
“新自由主义的半人马。”

105
00:06:35.537 --> 00:06:37.368
Now, the centaur, as you might recall,
半人马，如果各位还记得，

106
00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:40.048
is this mythical creature in ancient Greek culture,
是古希腊文化中的神秘生物，

107
00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:41.655
half human, half beast.
半人，半马。

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:46.608
It has this upper part of a human and the lower part of a horse.
上半身是人，下半身是马。

109
00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:54.071
So the Centaur state is a state that turns its human face to those at the top of the social ladder
所以半人马的国家，就是指那些把它的人脸面对着社会上层阶级，

110
00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:58.575
while those at the bottom are being trampled over, stampeded.
而那些处于底层的人则被践踏的国家。

111
00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.073
So top income earners and large businesses

112
00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:04.647
can enjoy tax cuts and other supportive policies,
可以享受减税和其他支持性政策，

113
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:10.497
while the unemployed, the poor are made to prove themselves worthy for the state's help,
而失业者和穷人则被要求去证明他们值得国家援助，

114
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.348
are morally disciplined,

or often criminalized.

In Latvia, we've had such a Centaur state model

118
00:07:22.488 --> 00:07:24.767
firmly in place since the '90s.
这种半人半马的国家模式就已经存在了。

119
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:29.041
Take, for example, the flat income tax that we had in place up until this year
例如，我们在今年之前一直实行的单一所得税

120
00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.416
that has been benefiting the highest earners,

while one quarter of the population keeps living in poverty.

122
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.890
And the crisis and the austerity has made these kinds of social inequalities worse.
经济危机和财政紧缩使得这种社会不平等更加严重。

123
00:07:40.914 --> 00:07:45.373
So while the capital of the banks and the wealthy has been protected,
所当银行和富人资本得到保护时，

124
00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.159
those who lost the most
失去最多的人

125
00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:50.431
were taught lessons in individual responsibility.
反而被教导承担个人责任。

126
00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:56.262
Now, as I was talking to people who I met at these seminars,
那么当我和在这些研讨会上遇到的人交谈时，

127
00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:58.544
I was expecting them to be angry.

128
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:03.178
I was expecting them to be resisting these lessons in individual responsibility.
我预期他们会抵制这些关于个人责任的培训。

129
00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:07.536
After all, the crisis was not their fault, yet they were bearing the brunt of it.
毕竟，危机不是他们的错，然而他们受到的冲击却最大。

130
00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:11.488
But as people were sharing their stories with me,
但随着人们和我们分享他们的故事，

131
00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:18.303
I was struck again and again by the power of the idea of responsibility.
我一次次被责任这种力量所震撼。

132
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.905
One of the people I met was Žanete.
我遇到的其中一个人是扎纳特。

133

She had been working for 23 years

134
00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:30.587
teaching sewing and other crafts at the vocational school in Riga.

And now the crisis hits,

and the school is closed as part of the austerity measures.

137
00:08:36.097 --> 00:08:42.031
The educational system restructuring was part of a way of saving public money.
教育系统重组是节省公共资金的一种方式。

138
00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:45.153
And 10,000 teachers across the country lose their jobs,
全国有 1 万名教师失去了工作，

139
00:08:45.153 --> 00:08:46.783
and Žanete is one of them.
扎纳特就是其中一员。

140
00:08:46.783 --> 00:08:49.716
And I know from what she's been telling me
从她的描述中我了解到，

141
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.482
that losing her job has put her in a desperate situation;
失业把她推到了绝望的境地；

142
00:08:52.506 --> 00:08:56.699
she's divorced, she has two teenage children that she's the sole provider for.
她离婚了，有两个 10 多岁的孩子需要她一个人抚养。

143
00:08:56.723 --> 00:08:59.213
And yet, as we are talking,
然而，随着我们交谈的深入，

144
00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:03.407
she says to me that the crisis is really an opportunity.
她却说，这场危机真是个机会。

145
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:07.900
She says, "I turn 50 this year.
她说，“我今年50岁了。

146
00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:12.850
I guess life has really given me this chance to look around, to stop,
我猜生活是想给我这个机会停下来，去看看周围，

147
00:09:12.874 --> 00:09:15.249
because all these years I've been working nonstop,
因为这些年来我一直无休地工作，

148
00:09:15.273 --> 00:09:16.736
had no time to pause.
没有时间暂停一下。

149
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.583
And now I have stopped,
如今我停下来了，

150
00:09:18.607 --> 00:09:24.839
and I've been given an opportunity to look at everything and to decide what it is that I want
我有了这个机会去看看这一切，并决定什么是我想要的，

151
00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.675
and what it is that I don't want.
以及什么是我不想要的。

152
00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:30.406
All this time, sewing, sewing, some kind of exhaustion."
一直以来都是缝呀，缝呀，真让人精疲力竭。“

153
00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:35.347
So Žanete is made redundant after 23 years.
于是在 23 年后，扎纳特被裁员了。

154
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:37.717
But she's not thinking about protesting.
但她没有考虑抗议。

155
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:41.615
She's not talking about the 99 percent against the one percent.

156
00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.568
She is analyzing herself.
她在分析自己。

157
00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:47.151
And she was thinking pragmatically of starting a small business

158
00:09:47.175 --> 00:09:52.237
out of her bedroom making these little souvenir dolls to sell to tourists.
打算在自己的卧室里做些小纪念品娃娃卖给游客。

159
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.821
I also met Aivars at the unemployment office.
我也在失业办公室遇见了埃瓦斯。

160
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.960
Aivars was in his late 40s,
埃瓦斯年近 40，

161
00:09:56.984 --> 00:10:01.494
he had lost a job at the government agency overseeing road construction.
他失去了政府机构监督道路建设的工作。

162
00:10:02.153 --> 00:10:06.235
To one of our meetings, Aivars brings a book he's been reading.
在我们的某次会面上，埃瓦斯带来了一本他正在阅读的书。

163
00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:13.116
It's called "Vaccination against Stress, or Psycho-energetic Aikido."
书名叫《压力的疫苗，心力的合气道》。

164
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.086
Now, some of you might know that aikido is a form of martial art,
在座有些人可能知道，合气道是一种武术，

165
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.703
so, psycho-energetic aikido.
所以，心力的合气道。

166
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.376
And Aivars tells me that after several months
埃瓦斯告诉我，在经历失业后

167
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.951
of reading and thinking and reflecting while being out of work,
数个月的阅读和反思后，

168
00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:32.726
he has understood that his current difficulties are really his own doing.
他理解了当下的困难是他自找的。

169
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.680
He says to me,
他和我说，

170
00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:36.632
"I created it myself.

171
00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:39.696
I was in a psychological state that was not good for me.
我处在了对自己非常不利的心理状态中。

172
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.049
If a person is afraid to lose their money, to lose their job,

173
00:10:43.073 --> 00:10:46.080
they start getting more stressed, more unsettled, more fearful.

174
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.695
That's what they get."
而这就是后果。”

175
00:10:48.324 --> 00:10:50.217
As I ask him to explain,
我让他详细解释一下，

176
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:54.553
he compares his thoughts poetically to wild horses running in all directions,
于是他把自己的思想诗意地比做四处奔跑的野马，

177
00:10:54.577 --> 00:10:57.591
and he says, "You need to be a shepherd of your thoughts.
他说，“你需要引导自己的思想。

178
00:10:58.577 --> 00:11:00.855
To get things in order in the material world,
要让现实世界井然有序，

179
00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:02.901
you need to be a shepherd of your thoughts,
你就需要引导自己的思想，

180
00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:06.308
because it's through your thoughts that everything else gets orderly."
因为只有通过你的思想，其他一切才会变得井然有序。”

181
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.576
"Lately," he says, "I have clearly understood
“最近”，他说道，“我清楚地明白了，

182
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.109
that the world around me, what happens to me,
我周围的世界，发生在我身上的事情，

183
00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:14.709
people that enter in my life ... it all depends directly on myself."
进入我生活的人… 全都取决于我自己。”

184
00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:19.855
So as Latvia is going through this extreme economic experiment,
于是随着拉脱维亚正在经历一场极端的经济实验，

185
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:23.021
Aivars says it's his way of thinking that has to change.
埃瓦斯说，他的思考模式也需要改变。

186
00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:27.756
He's blaming himself for what he's going through at the moment.
他在为自己正在经历的一切自责。

187
00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:33.490
So taking responsibility is, of course, a good thing, right?
负责任当然是好事，对吧？

188
00:11:33.514 --> 00:11:38.275
It is especially meaningful and morally charged in a post-Soviet society,
在苏联解体后的社会里，这种做法尤其有道德上的意义，

189
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:43.161
where reliance on the state is seen as this unfortunate heritage of the Soviet past.
对国家的依赖被视为苏联过去的不幸遗产。

190
00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:46.760
But when I listen to Žanete and Aivars and to others,
但当我听着扎纳特和埃瓦斯和其他人的聊天时，

191
00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:50.311
I also thought how cruel this question is --
我也在想，这个问题真是太残酷了——

192
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.239
"Where is your responsibility?" --
“你的责任在哪里？”——

193
00:11:52.263 --> 00:11:53.487
how punishing.
惩罚的意味如此明显。

194
00:11:53.511 --> 00:11:59.864
Because, it was working as a way of blaming and pacifying people who were hit worst by the crisis.
因为这是责备和安抚受危机冲击影响最大的人群的一种方式。

195
00:11:59.888 --> 00:12:03.432
So while Greeks were out in the streets, Latvians swallowed the toad,
所以当希腊人上街时，拉脱维亚人“吞下了癞蛤蟆”，

196
00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.759
and many tens of thousands emigrated,
成千上万的人移居国外，

197
00:12:06.783 --> 00:12:09.575
which is another way of taking responsibility.
另一种负起责任的方式。

198
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:15.113
So the language, the language of individual responsibility,
所以这个说辞，个人责任的说辞，

199
00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:17.519
has become a form of collective denial.
已经成为集体否认的一种方式。

200
00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:21.268
As long as we have social policies that treat unemployment
只要我们的社会政策把失业率

201
00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:23.063
as individual failure
视为个人失败，

202
00:12:23.087 --> 00:12:27.007
but we don't have enough funding for programs that give people real skills
而没有足够的资金来资助那些能给人们提供真正技能的项目

203
00:12:27.031 --> 00:12:28.608
or create workplaces,
或者创造工作机会，

204
00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:31.813
we are blind of the policymakers' responsibility.
我们就忽视了政策制定者的责任。

205
00:12:31.837 --> 00:12:35.684
As long as we stigmatize the poor as somehow passive or lazy
只要我们把穷人说成是消极或懒惰的，

206
00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:39.850
but don't give people real means to get out of poverty other than emigrating,
但除了移民外，不能给他们脱贫的真正方法，

207
00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:43.768
we are in denial of the true causes of poverty.
我们就是在否定贫穷的真正原因。

208
00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:45.641
And in the meantime,
同时，

209
00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:46.936
we all suffer,
我们全都在承受经济危机的后果。

210
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.095
because social scientists have shown with detailed statistical data
因为社会科学家提供的详细统计数据显示，

211
00:12:52.119 --> 00:13:00.911
that there are more people with both mental and physical health problems in societies with higher levels of economic inequality.
在经济不平等的社会中，人们的心理和生理问题更多。

212
00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:06.354
So social inequality is apparently bad for not only those with least resources
所以社会不平等显然不仅仅不利于资源最匮乏的人群，

213
00:13:06.378 --> 00:13:07.566
but for all of us,
对我们所有人也是如此，

214
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.076
because living in a society with high inequality
因为生活在高度不平等的社会，

215
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.279
means living in a society with low social trust and high anxiety.
意味着生活在一个低信任度及高焦虑的社会中。

216
00:13:14.748 --> 00:13:15.927
So there we are.
所以我们就走到了今天这一步。

217
00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:17.837
We're all reading self-help books,
我们都在阅读自助指南，

218
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:19.569
we try to hack our habits,
我们努力改变习惯，

219
00:13:19.593 --> 00:13:21.431
we try to rewire our brains,
我们试图重构大脑，

220
00:13:21.455 --> 00:13:23.160
we meditate.
我们冥想。

221
00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:25.552
And it helps, of course, in a way.
当然，在某种程度上这样做确实有些帮助，

222
00:13:26.234 --> 00:13:28.920
Self-help books help us feel more upbeat.
自助书籍帮助我们感觉乐观。

223
00:13:28.944 --> 00:13:33.878
Meditation can help us feel more connected to others spiritually.
冥想能够帮助我们感觉在精神上跟他人建立更紧密的链接。

224
00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:36.408
What I think we need
我认为，我们需要的是

225
00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:41.461
is as much awareness of what connects us to one another socially,
更多地意识到是什么把我们联系在一起，

226
00:13:41.485 --> 00:13:44.396
because social inequality hurts us all.
因为社会不平等会伤害我们所有人。

227
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.261
So we need more compassionate social policies
因此，我们需要更多富有同情心的社会政策，

228
00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:51.504
that are aimed less at moral education
更少地着眼于道德教育，

229
00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:56.066
and more at promotion of social justice and equality.
更多地倡导社会公平和平等。

230
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.289
Thank you.
谢谢。

231
00:13:57.313 --> 00:13:59.817
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
