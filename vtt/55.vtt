42
00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:21.661
this radical reversal of our planetary sprawl,

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:32.422
at the intensity of the densest city that already exists,

46
00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:37.677
Planet City could occupy as little as 0.02 percent earth.

47
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:42.849
Could we imagine coming to such a global consensus,

(Ambient music)
（氛围音乐）

52

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:05.080
almost the entirety of the globe to nature,

62
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.987
not in a singular forced move,

63
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.744
but perhaps in a slow, multigenerational retreat from the world we once knew.

64
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.334
To build Planet City, we could remine our old cities rather than virgin ground.
我们能在旧城的基础上建造地球城， 不必开采处女地。

65
00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:56.464
No new resources would need to be consumed or extracted to build this city.

67
00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:04.556
into our malls and storefronts
那些消费品是在地球身上扯下的。

68
00:05:04.598 --> 00:05:06.057
could be reversed

and repurposed to bring all this material back together again

70
00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:13.482
into the geological strata of our new city.

(Ambient music)

75
00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:42.176
If we were to map all the world's celebrations onto a calendar,
如果全世界的庆典都纳入一个日历，

76
00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:44.847
then we'd realize that running through Planet City
那在星球城市里奔跑

77
00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:48.015
would be this continuous festival procession
就会一直身处庆祝节日的队伍中，

00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:54.730
dancing across a 365 day loop, each day amongst the flickering confetti.
在亮晶晶的五彩纸屑中舞动， 365天每天如此循环。

79

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:02.697
endlessly cycling through new colors, costumes and cacophonies.
新服饰和喧闹声，认识新的节日文化。

81
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:04.740
And to design the systems of Planet City,

89
00:06:28.182 --> 00:06:30.809
These monumental infrastructures

90
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.353
are evidence that much of the technologies required
都证明了绝大部分

91
00:06:33.394 --> 00:06:35.813
to support the generation of our climate
支撑气候产物所需的技术

92
00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:38.108
are actually already here.
已然问世。

93
00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:42.528
And in Planet City, we just remove the political roadblocks

94
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:45.949
or the lack of cultural investment that's currently holding them back

95
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.120
and we visualize them operating at these global scales,

96
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.122
but not forgotten out on an industrial periphery,
但这不会被遗忘在工业外围，

97
00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:57.418
but woven through the very fabric and life of the city itself.
而是交织在城市本身的结构和生活中。

98
00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:06.720
So before dawn breaks in Planet City,

99
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:11.432
thousands of autonomous cleaning blades squeak along the solar fields.
数以千计的自动清洁刀片 在太阳能发电场上吱吱作响。

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.828
to high-altitude holding lakes in the city's upper floors.

106
00:07:32.495 --> 00:07:35.873
Power will be stored here as potential energy

107
00:07:35.874 --> 00:07:39.627
rather than resource-intensive lithium batteries.

108
00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:39.628
And tides rise and fall as the lights glow and turbines spin.
随着灯光的闪耀和涡轮机的旋转， 潮汐也随之起伏。

109
00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:44.550

随着灯光的闪耀和涡轮机的旋转， 潮汐也随之起伏。

110
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.677

in the real science and technology of the present moment,

113
00:07:52.848 --> 00:07:56.728
meaning we can project ourselves into these futures.
这意味着我们可以 将自己投射到这种未来。

114
00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:01.774
What would it be like to live here, to fish amongst the city battery lakes,

115
00:08:01.817 --> 00:08:04.403
to follow the seasons up through the towers,

117
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.495
to fall in love amongst the pink algae blooms before harvest?

118
00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:17.331
So Planet City is not a proposal.
所以尽管星球城市并非是提案，

119
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.875
However, it's a provocation.
它十分动人。

120
00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:23.671
It's a thought experiment that shows us
这个思想实验告诉我们

121
00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:27.134
we don't need to tread so hard across the Earth
无需在地球上如此艰难地跋涉，

122
00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:31.305
because if we can get these systems working at the scale of 10 billion,
因为如果能够让这些系统 容纳下100亿人，

123
00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:33.639
then the only things stopping us
阻止我们

124
00:08:33.682 --> 00:08:38.561
rethinking and consolidating our existing cities is ourselves,

00:08:38.603 --> 00:08:43.483
our own politics and prejudices, biases and blind spots.
我们自己的政治观点和偏见盲区。

126
00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:45.819
So in many ways,

00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.989
all of us have been living in a planetary-scaled city all along.

128
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:50.406
We have urbanized our planet

129
00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:54.328
from the scale of the cell to the tectonic plate.
小到细胞规模，到大到地壳版块。

130
00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:57.705
Planet City is both entirely fictional,

131
00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:57.706
but also already here.
又已然存在。

132

that are facing us today.
一种急需的照亮。

137
00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:20.019
as we've been wandering through this sci-fi safari through Planet City,
徘徊于科幻的野生动物园。 旅程结束之际，

138
00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:25.816
we will return to where we first started to look back on our own cities again,
让我们回到起始点， 用新的眼光再次回顾

139
00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:27.819

This journey has been a call to actively visualize our possible futures.
