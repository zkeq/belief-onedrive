00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.986
Some people think that there's a TED Talk formula:
有人认为TED演讲有一个固定模式：

2
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.985
"Give a talk on a round, red rug."
“站在一块圆形的红地毯上。”

3
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.411
"Share a childhood story."

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:24.411
No.
不是的。

7
00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.532
That's not how to think of a TED Talk.
我们不该这么来看待TED演讲。

8
00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:28.545
In fact, if you overuse those devices,

9
00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.712
you're just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative.
只会给人留下陈词滥调 或者心灵鸡汤的感觉。

10
00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:36.616
But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common,
但所有优秀的TED演讲 确实有一个共同点，

11
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.319
and I would like to share that thing with you,
这也是我想和各位分享的，

12
00:00:39.343 --> 00:00:42.018
because over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat,
因为12年来我一直坐在场边,

13
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:46.781
listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers, like these.

I've helped them prepare their talks for prime time,

their secrets of what makes for a great talk.

18
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.021
completely different,
都各不相同，

19
00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:00.781
they actually do have one key common ingredient.

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:02.367

Your number one task as a speaker

22

a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea.

39
00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.072

just by people listening to a voice and watching a face.

49
00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:30.819
Well, you can think of it as a pattern of information

50
00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:34.231

is as important in education as literacy,

59
00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.079
Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy -- building from bamboo is beautiful.

（视频）奇麻曼达·阿迪契： 单一的故事会导致片面，

64
00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:17.023
and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,
片面的问题并不在于它不正确，

65
00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:19.031
but that they are incomplete.
而在于它不完整。

66
00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:21.641
CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,
你的大脑里充满了各种想法，

67
00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:23.016
and not just randomly.
它们并不是随机的，

68
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.246
They're carefully linked together.

69
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.175
Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure
它们汇集成神奇而复杂的体系，

70
00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.373
that is your personal worldview.
形成你的世界观。

71
00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:32.683
It's your brain's operating system.

73
00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:38.388
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas.
是数百万个想法的大集合。

74
00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:41.881
So, for example, if one little component of your worldview

75
00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:44.731
is the idea that kittens are adorable,
告诉你小猫很可爱，

76
00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.150
then when you see this,
那么当你看到小猫时，

77
00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:48.754
you'll react like this.
你就会抚摸它。

78
00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:50.855
But if another component of your worldview
而另一部分告诉你

79
00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.142
is the idea that leopards are dangerous,
美洲豹很危险，

80
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.411
then when you see this,
那么当你看见它时，

81
00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:56.696
you'll react a little bit differently.
你可能会撒腿就跑。

82
00:03:57.344 --> 00:03:58.932
So, it's pretty obvious
所以显而易见，

83
00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:02.869
why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial.
这些想法对于塑造你的 世界观至关重要。

84
00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:05.889
You need them to be as reliable as possible -- a guide,

85
00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:09.701
to the scary but wonderful real world out there.

86
00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:13.472
Now, different people's worldviews can be dramatically different.

87
00:04:14.018 --> 00:04:15.204
For example,
举个例子，

how does your worldview react when you see this image:
你对下面的视频会有什么反应？

89
00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.707
(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me?
（视频）达利亚·莫佳德： 你看到我的时候你在想什么？

91
00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:31.931

92
00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:33.120
"a terrorist"?

93
00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:35.169
CA: Whatever your answer,
无论你的答案是什么，

94
00:04:35.193 --> 00:04:38.590
there are millions of people out there who would react very differently.
成千上万的人， 就会有成千上万种答案。

95
00:04:38.614 --> 00:04:40.690
So that's why ideas really matter.
正因为此，想法才非常重要。

96
00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:44.392
If communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever,

97
00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.465
how someone thinks about the world,
改变一个人的世界观，

98
00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:50.874
and shaping their actions both now and well into the future.
影响他们现在和未来的的行为。

99
00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:55.304
Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.
想法是塑造人类文化 最强大的力量。

100
00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.479
So if you accept
如果你认同，

101
00:04:56.503 --> 00:04:59.233
that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea
演讲者最重要的 任务是提出一个想法，

102
00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.303
inside the minds of your audience,
并让听众认同，

103
00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:04.621
here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:
那么这里有四条原则你可以遵循：

104
00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:08.466
One, limit your talk to just one major idea.
第一，让你的演讲主题明确。

105
00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:10.810
Ideas are complex things;
想法是复杂的，

106
00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:14.199
you need to slash back your content so that you can focus
你要避免长篇大论，专注于

107
00:05:14.223 --> 00:05:16.976
on the single idea you're most passionate about,
最让你激动不已的那个想法，

108
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.634
and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly.
并想办法把它解释清楚。

109
00:05:20.658 --> 00:05:24.411
You have to give context, share examples, make it vivid.
你需要解释背景， 举例说明，娓娓道来。

110
00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:25.682
So pick one idea,
所以只挑选一个想法，

111
00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:28.907
and make it the through-line running through your entire talk,
让它贯穿你的整个演讲，

112
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:32.409
so that everything you say links back to it in some way.
让你讲的所有内容都能与之呼应。

113
00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:36.377
Two, give your listeners a reason to care.
第二，吸引你的听众。

114
00:05:37.343 --> 00:05:41.374
Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience,
在你将自己的想法灌输给观众之前，

115
00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:43.803
you have to get their permission to welcome you in.
你必须得到他们的允许。

116
00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:45.660
And the main tool to achieve that?
那主要手段是什么呢？

117
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:47.344
Curiosity.
好奇心。

118
00:05:47.368 --> 00:05:49.616
Stir your audience's curiosity.
勾起观众的好奇心。

119
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.861
Use intriguing, provocative questions
提一些耐人寻味，引人入胜的问题

120
00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:56.066
to identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining.
让大家发现有些事情 不合理，需要解释。

121
00:05:56.518 --> 00:06:00.479
If you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview,
如果你让某人发现， 他的世界观里有空白，

122
00:06:00.503 --> 00:06:03.820
they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap.
他们就会想把这缺口补上。

123
00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:05.883
And once you've sparked that desire,
一旦你勾起他们的求知欲，

124
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:09.191
it will be so much easier to start building your idea.
灌输你的想法就容易多了。

125
00:06:09.852 --> 00:06:13.225
Three, build your idea, piece by piece,
第三，构筑你的想法， 一步一步来，

126
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:16.963
out of concepts that your audience already understands.
要使用观众已经了解的概念。

127
00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:18.634
You use the power of language
用语言的力量，

128
00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:21.587
to weave together concepts that already exist
把观众脑海中已经存在的概念

129
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:23.248
in your listeners' minds --
重新整合——

130
00:06:23.272 --> 00:06:25.566
but not your language, their language.
不过要用观众能懂的语言。

131
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.026
You start where they are.
你要让他们跟上你的节奏。

132
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.748
The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with
演讲者经常会忘记， 自己每天接触的术语和概念，

133
00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:33.383
are completely unfamiliar to their audiences.
在观众们眼中可能就是天书。

134
00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:38.581
Now, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together,
因此，善用比喻非常重要，

135
00:06:38.605 --> 00:06:42.279
because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern,
因为比喻是用听众已经了解的概念，

136
00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:45.811
based on an idea that the listener already understands.
来勾画缺失的那一块知识拼图。

137
00:06:45.835 --> 00:06:47.820
For example, when Jennifer Kahn
比如，当珍妮弗·卡恩

138
00:06:47.844 --> 00:06:51.493
wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR,
想解释一种叫做CRISPR的 最前端的生物技术时，

139
00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:53.803
she said, "It's as if, for the first time,
她说：“这项技术，就像你第一次

140
00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:56.858
you had a word processor to edit DNA.
拥有了一台可以编辑DNA的 文字处理机一样。

141
00:06:56.882 --> 00:07:01.509
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily."
CRISPR能让你十分轻松的 剪切和粘贴基因组信息。”

142
00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:06.263
Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment
就这样，一个生动的描述， 让我们恍然大悟，

143
00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:08.620
as it snaps into place in our minds.
