1
00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:14.169
Why do we cheat?
我们为何出轨？

2
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.748
And why do happy people cheat?
为何幸福之人也会出轨？

3
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:25.267
And when we say "infidelity," what exactly do we mean?
我们所谓的“不忠”到底指的是什么？

4
00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:32.406
Is it a hookup, a love story, paid sex, a chat room,
是一夜情？爱情故事？ 有偿性服务？私聊？

5
00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.445
a massage with a happy ending?
还是特殊按摩服务？

6
00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:41.314
Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy,
为什么我们认为男人出轨 是因为寻求刺激或是害怕亲密关系，

7
00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:46.076
but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?
而女人出轨是因为孤独 或是渴求亲密关系？

8
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.819
And is an affair always the end of a relationship?
婚外情是不是意味着婚姻已走到尽头？

9
00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:56.310
For the past 10 years, I have traveled the globe
在过去十年间，我走遍世界

10
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.355
and worked extensively with hundreds of couples
走访了数百对夫妻，

11
00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:01.542
who have been shattered by infidelity.
他们都因出轨而心力交瘁。

12
00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.422
There is one simple act of transgression
婚外情毫无疑问是一种越轨行为，

13
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:10.810
that can rob a couple of their relationship,
它离间夫妻关系，

14
00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:15.065
their happiness and their very identity: an affair.
破坏家庭幸福，衍生信任危机。

15
00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:20.937
And yet, this extremely common act is so poorly understood.
然而，我们对这一普遍现象的 理解却极其有限。

16
00:01:22.413 --> 00:01:27.044
So this talk is for anyone who has ever loved.
因此我将这次演讲 献给所有经历过爱情的人。

17
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:33.345
Adultery has existed since marriage was invented,
婚外情自婚姻诞生之日起就存在了，

18
00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:35.890
and so, too, the taboo against it.
我们对婚外情的反对亦是如此。

19
00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:42.647
In fact, infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy,
实际上，婚外情比婚姻顽强多了， 婚姻只有嫉妒的份儿，

20
00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:46.105
so much so, that this is the only commandment
以至于它成为了圣经的戒律，

21
00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.041
that is repeated twice in the Bible:
并且重复出现两次：

22
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:54.145
once for doing it, and once just for thinking about it.
一次是不准做， 另一次是连想都不准想。

23
00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:56.415
(Laughter)
（笑声）

24
00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.742
So how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden,
那我们究竟如何处理出轨，

25
00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:03.187
yet universally practiced?
这一屡禁不止的现象呢？

26
00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:09.856
Now, throughout history, men practically had a license to cheat
自古以来，男人出轨是被允许的，

27
00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:12.151
with little consequence,
几乎不用承担什么后果，

28
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:16.559
and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories
甚至还有生物理论和进化理论

29
00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.135
that justified their need to roam,
来为他们撑腰，

30
00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:23.112
so the double standard is as old as adultery itself.
这一双重标准自婚外情 诞生之日起就存在了。

31
00:02:24.223 --> 00:02:29.536
But who knows what's really going on under the sheets there, right?
但在床上到底发生了什么， 其实谁也不清楚，对吧？

32
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.572
Because when it comes to sex,
因为一谈到性，

33
00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:35.759
the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate,
男人可以夸夸奇谈，自吹自擂，

34
00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:41.304
but the pressure for women is to hide, minimize and deny,
而女人却要遮遮掩掩。

35
00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:45.530
which isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries
难以置信的是， 如今仍有9个国家的女性

36
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.054
where women can be killed for straying.
会因出轨而被处死。

37
00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:54.240
Now, monogamy used to be one person for life.
一夫一妻制， 曾经指的是“一辈子一个”，

38
00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:57.335
Today, monogamy is one person at a time.
而现在指的是“每次一个”。

39
00:02:58.088 --> 00:02:59.953
(Laughter)
（笑声）

40
00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:01.843
(Applause)
（掌声）

41
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.120
I mean, many of you probably have said,
我想，在座有很多人可能说过，

42
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.708
"I am monogamous in all my relationships."
“我在每段关系里都遵守一夫一妻制”。

43
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.683
(Laughter)
（笑声）

44
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:14.080
We used to marry,
过去我们先结婚，

45
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.989
and had sex for the first time.
再初尝禁果。

46
00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:17.896
But now we marry,
而现在，我们先结婚，

47
00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.823
and we stop having sex with others.
然后停止与别人发生关系。

48
00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:25.497
The fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love.
实际上一夫一妻制已经与爱情无关。

49
00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:28.715
Men relied on women's fidelity
男人根据女人是否忠诚，

50
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.779
in order to know whose children these are,
来判断孩子是不是自己的，

51
00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.120
and who gets the cows when I die.
进而决定遗产归谁。

52
00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:38.475
Now, everyone wants to know
大家都想知道，

53
00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:40.223
what percentage of people cheat.
出轨的人到底占多少百分比。

54
00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:43.454
I've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference.
从我到达现场， 就不停有人问这个问题。

55
00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:46.056
(Laughter)
（笑声）

56
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.460
It applies to you.
这跟你们也有关系。

57
00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:52.779
But the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding:
因为出轨的含义在不断扩大：

58
00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:57.841
sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps.
发色情短信，看黄片， 在约会软件上玩暧昧。

59
00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:02.637
So because there is no universally agreed-upon definition
正因为缺乏一个统一的定义，

60
00:04:02.637 --> 00:04:05.776
of what even constitutes an infidelity,
到底什么才算出轨，

61
00:04:05.776 --> 00:04:11.406
estimates vary widely, from 26 percent to 75 percent.
因此这个百分比范围很广， 从26%到75%。

62
00:04:12.548 --> 00:04:15.779
But on top of it, we are walking contradictions.
但与此相矛盾的是，

63
00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:19.612
So 95 percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong
有95%的人认为， 另一半试图掩盖

64
00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:22.789
for our partner to lie about having an affair,
出轨的事实是不可饶恕的，

65
00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.010
but just about the same amount of us will say
但差不多同样多的人也会说：

66
00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:28.168
that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one.
如果我出轨的话肯定也不会声张。

67
00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:30.628
(Laughter)
（笑声）

68
00:04:31.692 --> 00:04:35.397
Now, I like this definition of an affair --
我倾向于这样来定义婚外情，

69
00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:39.146
it brings together the three key elements:
它包含三个要素：

70
00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:44.852
a secretive relationship, which is the core structure of an affair;
首先是遮遮掩掩的关系， 这是婚外情的核心；

71
00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:49.646
an emotional connection to one degree or another;
二是拥有某种程度上的感情联系；

72
00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:51.286
and a sexual alchemy.
三是性幻想。

73
00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:55.157
And alchemy is the key word here,
性吸引是这里的关键词，

74
00:04:55.157 --> 00:05:02.085
because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving,
对于性高潮而言，即便是想象出来的亲吻，

75
00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.169
can be as powerful and as enchanting
也和数小时的翻云覆雨，

76
00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.659
as hours of actual lovemaking.
拥有同样的魔力。

77
00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:11.135
As Marcel Proust said,
如马塞尔·普鲁斯特所言，

78
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.460
it's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person.
“我们的爱源自想象，而非源自对方。”

79
00:05:17.722 --> 00:05:21.578
So it's never been easier to cheat,
因此出轨是很容易的，

80
00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:25.055
and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret.
但保守出轨的秘密却难上加难。

81
00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.279
And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll.
因为（出轨者）要承受巨大的心理压力。

82
00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:35.162
When marriage was an economic enterprise,
如果婚姻是一家企业，

83
00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:38.128
infidelity threatened our economic security.
那婚外情威胁它的经济安全。

84
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:41.779
But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement,
如果婚姻是一种浪漫协议，

85
00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.599
infidelity threatens our emotional security.
那婚外情威胁我们的情感安全。

86
00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.860
Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --
讽刺的是，我们曾经对婚外情充满幻想，

87
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.089
that was the space where we sought pure love.
认为它是孕育真爱之地。

88
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:55.302
But now that we seek love in marriage,
而现在我们从婚姻中寻找爱情，

89
00:05:55.302 --> 00:05:56.962
adultery destroys it.
而婚外情则将其摧毁。

90
00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:03.167
Now, there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today.
我认为，如今的婚外情有三大罪状。

91
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.433
We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person
我们浪漫地认为，会有那么一个人，

92
00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.630
to fulfill an endless list of needs:
能满足我们所有的需求：

93
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.230
to be my greatest lover, my best friend,
是我最棒的情人，最好的朋友，

94
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.383
the best parent, my trusted confidant,
最好的父母，最信任的知己，

95
00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:24.477
my emotional companion, my intellectual equal.
是情感伴侣，又志趣相投。

96
00:06:25.445 --> 00:06:29.749
And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,
而我自己则符合上述所有条件： 我万里挑一，我独一无二，

97
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.065
I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,
我不可或缺，我无法取代，

98
00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:34.255
I'm the one.
我就是真命天子（女）。

99
00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.334
And infidelity tells me I'm not.
但婚外情告诉我，并不是那么回事。

100
00:06:39.128 --> 00:06:41.017
It is the ultimate betrayal.
这是一种终极背叛。

101
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.945
Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love.
出轨粉碎了我们对爱情的憧憬。

102
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.381
But if throughout history, infidelity has always been painful,
如果回顾历史， 婚外情从来都是充满痛苦的，

103
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.739
today it is often traumatic,
而在今天更是有过之而不及，

104
00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:56.540
because it threatens our sense of self.
因为它威胁了我们的自我意识。

105
00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:59.643
So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.
我的一个病人费尔南多，就深受其害。

106
00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:02.415
He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.
他说：“我曾以为我了解自己的生活，

107
00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:06.621
I thought I knew who you were, who we were as a couple, who I was.
我曾以为我了解你， 了解我们的婚姻，了解我自己。

108
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.842
Now, I question everything."
但现在，我对这一切都产生了怀疑。”

109
00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:14.639
Infidelity -- a violation of trust, a crisis of identity.
婚外情是对信任的践踏， 对自我认同的摧毁。

110
00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.944
"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.
“我还能再相信你吗？”他问。

111
00:07:16.968 --> 00:07:19.270
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"
“我还能相信任何人吗？”

112
00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:23.725
And this is also what my patient Heather is telling me,
我的另一个病人希瑟也有这种想法，

113
00:07:23.725 --> 00:07:26.352
when she's talking to me about her story with Nick.
她跟我讲了她和尼克的故事。

114
00:07:26.352 --> 00:07:27.802
Married, two kids.
他们结婚了，有两个孩子。

115
00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:30.479
Nick just left on a business trip,
尼克出差刚走，

116
00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.010
and Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys,
希瑟和孩子一起在玩尼克的iPad，

117
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.947
when she sees a message appear on the screen:
然后屏幕上出现了一条信息：

118
00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:38.485
"Can't wait to see you."
“我等不及想见你。”

119
00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:41.874
Strange, she thinks, we just saw each other.
真奇怪，希瑟想，我们不是刚见过吗？

120
00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:44.199
And then another message:
然后又来了一条：

121
00:07:44.723 --> 00:07:46.960
"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."
“真想马上拥抱你。”

122
00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:50.063
And Heather realizes
这时希瑟意识到，

123
00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:51.431
these are not for her.
这些信息不是发给自己的。

124
00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:55.628
She also tells me that her father had affairs,
希瑟说他父亲也有婚外情，

125
00:07:55.632 --> 00:07:59.573
but her mother, she found one little receipt in the pocket,
但她母亲只是在口袋里 发现了一张收据，

126
00:07:59.597 --> 00:08:01.755
and a little bit of lipstick on the collar.
在领子上发现了一点口红印。

127
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:06.430
Heather, she goes digging,
希瑟继续翻看着，

128
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.493
and she finds hundreds of messages,
发现了上百条信息，

129
00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:12.906
and photos exchanged and desires expressed.
里面有互换的照片， 以及各种互诉衷肠。

130
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.938
The vivid details of Nick's two-year affair
尼克出轨两年的确凿证据

131
00:08:15.938 --> 00:08:19.120
unfold in front of her in real time,
在她面前赤裸裸地呈现出来。

132
00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:21.092
And it made me think:
我不禁在想：

133
00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:26.138
Affairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts.
数字时代的出轨真是能让人 感到被千刀万剐，生不如死。

134
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.933
But then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days.
但是我们又发现了另外一个矛盾。

135
00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:33.237
Because of this romantic ideal,
因为前面说到的浪漫遐想，

136
00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:38.295
we are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor.
我们极度依赖自己伴侣的忠诚。

137
00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:42.364
But we also have never been more inclined to stray,
但同时，我们比以前也更容易出轨，

138
00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:45.075
and not because we have new desires today,
并不是因为我们有了新的欲望，

139
00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:46.821
but because we live in an era
而是我们现在所处的时代，

140
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:50.502
where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires,
让我们觉得有权利去追求自己的欲望，

141
00:08:50.502 --> 00:08:53.958
because this is the culture where I deserve to be happy.
这就是我们的文化特点：我有权快乐。

142
00:08:55.088 --> 00:08:58.851
And if we used to divorce because we were unhappy,
如果过去离婚是因为我们不快乐，

143
00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:01.684
today we divorce because we could be happier.
那现在离婚是因为我们可以更快乐。

144
00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:06.667
And if divorce carried all the shame,
如果在过去，离婚是不光彩的，

145
00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:10.558
today, choosing to stay when you can leave

146
00:09:10.558 --> 00:09:11.922
is the new shame.
才是不光彩。

147
00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:14.988
So Heather, she can't talk to her friends
所以希瑟，不敢告诉自己的朋友，

148
00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:18.249
because she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick,

149
00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:21.797
and everywhere she turns, she gets the same advice:

150
00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:24.422
Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:40.275
why do we still have affairs?
那为什么还要出轨呢？

155
00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:46.383
Now, the typical assumption is that if someone cheats,

156
00:09:46.383 --> 00:09:50.228
either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.
要么是婚姻出了毛病， 要么是你自己出了毛病。

157

But millions of people can't all be pathological.
但是不可能成千上万的人 全都有毛病吧。

158
00:09:56.203 --> 00:10:00.111
The logic goes like this: If you have everything you need at home,
这一观点的逻辑是这样的： 如果你的家庭完美无缺，

159
00:10:00.111 --> 00:10:03.535
then there is no need to go looking elsewhere,
那就没必要出轨了，

160
00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:07.002
assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage

that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

But what if passion has a finite shelf life?

00:10:15.444 --> 00:10:19.158
What if there are things that even a good relationship

can never provide?

00:10:22.007 --> 00:10:25.022
If even happy people cheat,

but one day they cross a line

Affairs are an act of betrayal,

after Hurricane Sandy.

尽管出轨时已经47岁， 但普莉娅找回了从未有过的青春。

it isn't always our partner that we are turning away from,

as much as we are looking for another self.

Now, all over the world,

are the ones that propel people to cross the line,

That in itself is a desire machine,

because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,

keeps you wanting that which you can't have.

that affairs don't happen in open relationships,

as the conversation about infidelity.

the freedom to have other sexual partners,

that if we do that which we are not supposed to do,

The fact is, the majority of couples

who have experienced affairs stay together.
婚外情的夫妻最后仍然在一起。

253
00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:25.219
But some of them will merely survive,

and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

But I'm not the one who did it."

But now that the affair is exposed,

they, too, get to claim more,

I've noticed that a lot of couples,

in the immediate aftermath of an affair,

that they haven't had in decades.

they don't know where it's coming from.

Something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire,
