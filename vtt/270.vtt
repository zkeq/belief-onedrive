00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.140
For the past decade,
在过去的十年里，

2
00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:17.066
I've been studying non-state armed groups:
我一直在研究非政府武装集团：

3
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.957
armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias.
像恐怖分子、造反派或民兵等武装组织。

4
00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:24.581
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
我记录他们在非战斗状态下都做些什么。

5
00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.168
My goal is to better understand these violent actors
我的目标是更好地了解这些暴力分子

6
00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:33.783
and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation.
并研究促进从暴力途径到非暴力对抗的过渡方式。

7
00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:37.211
I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.
我做过实地考察, 研究过政策层面, 在图书馆翻阅过资料.

8
00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:42.680
Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict,
理解非政府武装组织是解决当今大多数冲突的关键，

9
00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:44.260
because war has changed.
因为战争形态已经跟以前不一样了。

10
00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.744
It used to be a contest between states.
它曾经是国家间的竞赛，

11
00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:48.539
No longer.
但现在不是了。

12
00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:52.501
It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
现在它是政府与非政府组织间的冲突。

13
00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:56.792
For example, of the 216 peace agreements
例如，在1975年到2011间签署的216项

14
00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:00.226
signed between 1975 and 2011,
和平协议中，

15
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.430
196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.
其中196项是政府与非政府组织之间签订的。

16
00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:08.691
So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them
因此我们需要了解这些集团；我们需要要么参与他们

17
00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:13.604
or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.
要么在任何非成功不可的冲突解决过程中打败他们。

18
00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:15.042
So how do we do that?
那么我们怎么做？

19
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:18.629
We need to know what makes these organizations tick.
我们要知道是什么让这些组织采取武装行动

20
00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:21.761
We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight,
关于他们如何战斗、为何战斗我们了解很多，

21
00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:24.839
but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.
但是没人关注当他们不战斗时都在干什么。

22
00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:28.455
Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.
然而，武装斗争与非武装政治是相关联的。

23
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.777
It is all part of the same organization.
它们都是相同组织的一部分。

24
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.958
We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them,
我们甚至不能理解这些集团，遑论打败他们，

25
00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:35.870
if we don't have the full picture.
如果我们不能了解全貌的话。

26
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.018
And armed groups today are complex organizations.
当今的武装集团是复杂的组织。

27
00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.945
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,
以黎巴嫩真主党为例，

28
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.752
known for its violent confrontation against Israel.
它因暴力对抗以色列而出名。

29
00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.611
But since its creation in the early 1980s,

30
00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:50.220
Hezbollah has also set up a political party,

31
00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:53.561
a social-service network, and a military apparatus.
社会服务网络和军事机构。

32
00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.211
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,

33
00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:58.802
known for its suicide attacks against Israel,

also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

35
00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.732
So these groups do way more than just shoot.
因而这些集团所做的不仅仅是战斗。

36
00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:06.432
They multi-task.
他们进行多项任务。

printed in English and published to recruit.

Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising --

43
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.873
not looting, but setting up profitable businesses;

45
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:32.194

59
00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.822
or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS,

60
00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:18.144
can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security.
可以通过看这些团体提供安保的努力来理解。

61
00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:20.439
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,

62
00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:25.143
the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population.
提供安保对大众来说是个难以承受的高代价。

63
00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:29.408
But in general, providing social services fills a gap,

a governance gap left by the government,

例如，要理解2006年巴勒斯坦哈马斯的选举胜利

67

cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.890
Now, this is a really complex picture,

69
00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:49.391
yet in the West, when we look at armed groups,

we only think of the violent side.

71
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.513
But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength,

They rise because they fill a gap left by the government,

and they emerge to be both armed and political,

engage in violent struggle and provide governance.

And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated,

78
00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:16.624
the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.

79
00:04:16.648 --> 00:04:18.927
Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah?

Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?

83

Or maybe something else, something different and new?

84
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.582
And what about ISIS?

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.876
The lines are blurred.
界限模糊了。

86

We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between,

87
00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:42.095
and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today,

88
00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:45.595
the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.

89
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.745
This matters for governments, because to counter these groups,

90
00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:52.219
they will have to invest more in non-military tools.

Filling that governance gap

00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:57.946
has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.

93
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.609
This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding.
这对于调解和创建和平也很重要。

94
00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:03.664
If we better understand armed groups,

95
00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:06.150
we will better know what incentives to offer

96
00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:09.950
to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence.
实现从暴力到非暴力形式的过渡。

97
00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:13.951
So in this new contest between states and non-states,

98
00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:16.627
military power can win some battles,
军事力量可以赢得一些战斗，

99
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:19.484
but it will not give us peace nor stability.

100
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:21.753
To achieve these objectives,

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:28.607
what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap, in filling that governance gap
我们需要的是填补这项安保空白填补上政府管理的缺位

102
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.722
that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.
这才是阻止非政府武装组织繁荣的关键.
