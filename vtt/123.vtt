There's a man out there, somewhere,

who looks a little bit like the actor Idris Elba,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.076
or at least he did 20 years ago.

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.916
I don't know anything else about him,

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.836
except that he once saved my life
除了他曾经冒着生命危险，

6
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.500
by putting his own life in danger.
救过我一命。

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.796
This man ran across four lanes of freeway traffic in the middle of the night

to bring me back to safety

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.396
after a car accident that could have killed me.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.076
And the whole thing left me really shaken up, obviously,
这一切显然把我吓坏了，

11
00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:43.116
but it also left me with this kind of burning, gnawing need

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.740
to understand why he did it,
我想知道他为什么这么做，

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.356
what forces within him caused him to make the choice

14

that I owe my life to,

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.876
to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger?
足以让我欠他一条命？

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.940
In other words, what are the causes of his or anybody else's capacity for altruism?
换而言之，是什么铸就了他 和其他人的强烈利他心理？

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.676
But first let me tell you what happened.
但首先让我告诉你们 具体发生了什么。

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.156
That night, I was 19 years old

down the Interstate 5 freeway,

when a little dog darted out in front of my car.

22
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.316
And I did exactly what you're not supposed to do,
然后我做了决不该在 高速上做的一件事情，

23
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.700
which is swerve to avoid it.
就是急转方向去躲避这只狗。

24
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.740
And I discovered why you're not supposed to do that.
然而我很快就明白了 为什么这样做是错误的。

25
00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:18.876
I hit the dog anyways,
我还是不可避免地 撞上了那只狗，

26
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.516
and that sent the car into a fishtail,
导致车辆开始甩尾，

27
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.116
and then a spin across the freeway,
在高速公路上急速旋转，

28
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.716
until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway

29
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.676
faced backwards into oncoming traffic
车头朝后面对着来车的方向，

30

and then the engine died.

31
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.860
And I was sure in that moment that I was about to die too,
我当时以为自己死定了，

32
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.916
but I didn't

33
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.676
because of the actions of that one brave man

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.236
within a fraction of a second of seeing my stranded car

He never even told me his name,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.140
and I'm pretty sure I forgot to say thank you.

44
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.196
So before I go any further,

I tell you all of this

50
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.836
I became a psychology researcher,
我成为了一名心理学研究者，

51
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.636
and I've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others.
我致力于了解 人类关心他人的能力，

52
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.996
Where does it come from, and how does it develop,
这种能力从哪里来， 又是怎样形成与发展的？

53
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.260
and what are the extreme forms that it can take?

54
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.116
These questions are really important to understanding basic aspects
这些问题是理解人类的

55
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.380
of human social nature.
社会属性的关键。

56
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.236
A lot of people, and this includes everybody
很多人，包括哲学家，

57
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.156
from philosophers and economists to ordinary people
经济学家，还有普通人，

58
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.436
believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish,
都认为人的天性是自私的，

59
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.636
that we're only ever really motivated by our own welfare.
我们永远只会被 利己的事所激励。

60
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.956
But if that's true, why do some people, like the stranger who rescued me,
但如果那是真的，为什么总有 一些人会像救我的那个陌生人一样，

61
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.476
do selfless things, like helping other people
做着如此无私且利他的事情， 比如冒着极大的

62
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.940
at enormous risk and cost to themselves?
代价和风险去帮助别人？

63
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.996
Answering this question
要回答这个问题，

64
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.116
requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism,
我们要挖掘这些极端利他行为的本质，

65
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.516
and what might make people who engage in such acts
以及是什么导致了 这些人做出与他人

66
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.396
different than other people.
不同的行为。

67
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.500
But until recently, very little work on this topic had been done.
但直到现在，有关课题的 研究仍然十分有限。

68
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.556
The actions of the man who rescued me
我的救命恩人的行为

69
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.556
meet the most stringent definition of altruism,
已经能够达到“无私”中 最狭隘且苛刻的定义了，

70
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.196
which is a voluntary, costly behavior
也就是必须要是完全 自愿的、有代价的行为，

71
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.660
motivated by the desire to help another individual.
并且是被想帮助他人的 心理所驱动的。

72
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.580
So it's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other.
即这是一个完全利他行为。

73
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.940
What could possibly explain an action like that?
用什么能够解释这种行为呢？

74
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.876
One answer is compassion, obviously,
一种解释是怜悯之心，

75
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.700
which is a key driver of altruism.
显然，这是无私的 几个关键来源之一。

76
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.956
But then the question becomes,
接着这个问题转变为：

77
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.740
why do some people seem to have more of it than others?
为什么有些人会比 其他人的怜悯之心更强呢？

78
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.836
And the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people
答案也许是， 那些有高度怜悯心的人的

79
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.060
are different in fundamental ways.
大脑构造可能与 普通人有根本性区别。

80
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.836
But to figure out how,
想知道到底如何不同，

81
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.980
I actually started from the opposite end,
我实际上从精神病患者开始，

82
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.180
with psychopaths.
来逆向思考这个问题。

83
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.596
A common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature,
想要了解人类本性的某一方面时，

84
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.636
like the desire to help other people,
例如想要了解人们 帮助他人的欲望时，

85
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.796
is to study people in whom that desire is missing,
一个普遍的方式就是从缺失 这种欲望的人入手进行研究。

86
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.940
and psychopaths are exactly such a group.
精神病患者正是 这样的群体之一。

87
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.396
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder
精神病是一种 高级别的神经错乱，

88
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.516
with strongly genetic origins,
并且与基因有着很强的关联性，

89
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.436
and it results in a personality that's cold and uncaring
由此带来冷漠无情的性格特征，

90
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.984
and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior.
并且有着反社会倾向，甚至暴力倾向。

91
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.116
Once my colleagues and I at the National Institute of Mental Health
我和我的同事们曾 在国家心理健康研究中心

92
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.755
conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research
进行了首次针对 青少年精神病患者的

93
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.916
of psychopathic adolescents,
脑成像研究，

94
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.796
and our findings, and the findings of other researchers now,
我们，以及后来其他 研究者们的发现都一致表明，

95
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.116
have shown that people who are psychopathic
精神病患者的大脑

96
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.060
pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics.
会呈现出三种特性。

97
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.596
First, although they're not generally insensitive to other people's emotions,
首先，他们并不是普遍 不能识别所有的人类情感，

98
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.396
they are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress.
但是他们的确不能感知到 他人正处于悲伤或痛苦中。

99
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.636
And in particular,
尤其是，

100
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.556
they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one.
他们对于害怕这种面部神情 存在理解障碍，比如这个。

101
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.276
And fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress,
害怕的神情同时会传达出 迫切需要帮助和情感上的悲痛，

102
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.916
and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help
而这些会引诱出目击者的怜悯之心

103
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.196
in people who see them,
和想去帮助的欲望，

104
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.916
so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion
所以那些趋于缺少怜悯之心的人，

105
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.060
also tend to be insensitive to these cues.
同时也趋向于对这些 神情表现出不敏感。

106
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.556
The part of the brain
杏仁核是人类大脑中

107
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.476
that's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions
负责识别痛苦的面部表情的

108
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.756
is called the amygdala.
最重要的部分。

109
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.196
There are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely,
只有极少的人完全缺失杏仁核，

110
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.076
and they're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions.
他们对识别痛苦的神情 存在严重障碍。

111
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.476
And whereas healthy adults and children
当看到害怕的神情时，

112
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.116
usually show big spikes in amygdala activity
健康成年人与儿童的

113
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.276
when they look at fearful expressions,
杏仁核会反应活跃，

114
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.436
psychopaths' amygdalas are underreactive to these expressions.
精神病患者的杏仁核 则处于非活跃状态，

115
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.116
Sometimes they don't react at all,
有时候它们根本毫无反应。

116
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.760
which may be why they have trouble detecting these cues.
这也许解释了为什么 他们无法识别那些表情。

117
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.196
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas are smaller than average
最后，精神病患者的杏仁核的大小

118
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.820
by about 18 or 20 percent.
比平均水平小18%-20%。

119
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.556
So all of these findings are reliable and robust,
所有的这些发现都是 可靠而确凿的，

120
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.036
and they're very interesting.
也是十分有趣的。

121
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.716
But remember that my main interest
但要记得我主要的兴趣

122
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.276
is not understanding why people don't care about others.
不是想弄明白为什么 有的人不关心他人，

123
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.860
It's understanding why they do.
而是为什么有的人会关心。

124
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.996
So the real question is,
所以真正的问题是，

125
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.276
could extraordinary altruism,
拥有非凡的利他主义的人，

126
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.516
which is the opposite of psychopathy
也就是在同情心和 帮助他人的想法上

127
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.956
in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people,
与精神病患者 完全相反的一群人，

128
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.996
emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy?
他们是否在大脑构造中也与 精神病患者的大脑完全相反？

129
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.260
A sort of antipsychopathic brain,
是否拥有一种 “反精神错乱型大脑”，

130
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.796
better able to recognize other people's fear,
能够更加易于识别他人的恐惧，

131
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.236
an amygdala that's more reactive to this expression
并且有着更活跃

132
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.100
and maybe larger than average as well?
且体积更大的杏仁核？

133
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.756
As my research has now shown,
我的研究已经 证实了我们的猜想，

134
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.236
all three things are true.
上述三点都是存在的。

135
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.516
And we discovered this
我们的发现基于

136
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.556
by testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists.
对一批真正的极端 利他主义者的测试。

137
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.236
These are people who have given one of their own kidneys
他们会将自己的肾脏捐赠给

138
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.460
to a complete stranger.
一个完全陌生的人，

139
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.516
So these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery
也就是说他们完全自愿地 承受一个大型外科手术

140
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.156
so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed
来移除自己身上 一个健康的肾脏，

141
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.236
and transplanted into a very ill stranger
捐给一个从未见过，

142
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.300
that they've never met and may never meet.
甚至也永远不会相见的陌生人。

143
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.660
"Why would anybody do this?" is a very common question.
也许许多人都想问  “谁会想做这样的事啊？”。

144
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.716
And the answer may be
而答案很可能是

145
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.996
that the brains of these extraordinary altruists
那些极端利他主义者的大脑

146
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.820
have certain special characteristics.
有他们的独特之处。

147
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.076
They are better at recognizing other people's fear.
他们擅长识别他人的恐惧。

148
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.516
They're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress.
他们确确实实更能 察觉处在悲痛中的人。

149
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.196
This may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions.
这种行为部分源于他们的杏仁核 会对这些表情做出更活跃的反应。

150
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.156
And remember, this is the same part of the brain that we found
但要记得，我们发现神经病患者的

151
00:07:12.226 --> 00:07:15.020
was underreactive in people who are psychopathic.
大脑在同一区域，是处于非活动状态的。

152
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.436
And finally, their amygdalas are larger than average as well,
最后，利他者的杏仁核 也要比平均水平大，

153
00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:19.706
by about eight percent.
大百分之八左右。

154
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.436
So together, what these data suggest
总的来说，最终这些 实验数据都表明了，

155
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.076
is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world
这世界上有一种关爱衡量轴，

156
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.636
that's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic,
一个极端就是精神高度错乱，

157
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.156
and at the other by people who are very compassionate
处于另一个极端的人则 非常具有同情心，

158
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.100
and driven to acts of extreme altruism.
总是被极度利他的精神驱使着。

159
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.516
But I should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different
但我应该继续补充的是， 极端利他主义者之所以如此，

160
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.236
is not just that they're more compassionate than average.
并非仅仅因为他们的 同情心高于平均水平。

161
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.486
They are,
他们确实是有很强的同情心，

162
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.396
but what's even more unusual about them
但令他们更不同寻常的是

163
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.516
is that they're compassionate and altruistic
他们的同情和无私

164
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.476
not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle
并不只是针对他熟知的

165
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.476
of friends and family. Right?
核心圈子里人，对吗？

166
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.756
Because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with
因为对自己爱的人无私

167
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.980
is not extraordinary.
并不能使你与众不同。

168
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.036
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion extends way beyond that circle,
真正非凡的利他主义者的 恻隐之心远远超过那个圆圈，

169
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.276
even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances
甚至超出他们的社交圈

170
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.236
to people who are outside their social circle altogether,
和任何认识的人，

171
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.796
total strangers,
甚至完全是陌生人，

172
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.420
just like the man who rescued me.
就像救我的那个人一样。

173
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.276
And I've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors
如今我有机会去询问很多 无私的肾脏捐赠者，

174
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.676
how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion
问他们是如何建立一个 如此广阔的怜悯圈，

175
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.036
that they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney.
以至于愿意给完全 陌生的人捐赠肾脏。

176
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.556
And I found it's a really difficult question for them to answer.
然而我发现，他们不知道 怎么回答这个问题。

177
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.636
I say, "How is it that you're willing to do this thing
我说，“为什么你愿意去做

178
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.636
when so many other people don't?
大多数人都不愿意做的事情呢？

179
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.076
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans
你属于美国不到两千人的

180
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.716
who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.
肾脏捐赠者之一，

181
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.580
What is it that makes you so special?"
是什么让你如此特别？”

182
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.500
And what do they say?
你知道他们说了什么吗？

183
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.140
They say, "Nothing.
他们说，“没什么，

184
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.796
There's nothing special about me.
我没有什么不同，

185
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.619
I'm just the same as everybody else."
我跟所有人都一样。”

186
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.116
And I think that's actually a really telling answer,
其实我觉得这恰恰 是个很说明问题的回答，

187
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.980
because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don't look like this,
因为这说明利他主义者的 圆不是这样画的,

188
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.036
they look more like this.
而是这样的。

189
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.300
They have no center.
它们是没有圆心的。

190
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.556
These altruists literally don't think of themselves
这些无私的人从来就

191
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.836
as being at the center of anything,
不以自己为中心来思考问题，

192
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.820
as being better or more inherently important than anybody else.
不觉得自己比其他人更重要。

193
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.036
When I asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her,
当我问利他主义者 为什么捐赠肾脏时，

194
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.780
she said, "Because it's not about me."
她说，“因为这对他们更重要。”

195
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.596
Another said,
另一个人说，

196
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.876
"I'm not different. I'm not unique.
“我没有什么不同。我并不特别。

197
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.236
Your study here is going to find out that I'm just the same as you."
你的研究最终只能 发现我跟你完全一样”。

198
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.356
I think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness
我觉得对这些神奇的 缺乏自我中心意识的行为，

199
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.236
is humility,
最好的解释是谦虚。

200
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.356
which is that quality that in the words of St. Augustine
正如奥古斯丁所说的

201
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.900
makes men as angels.
谦虚让人如同天使。

202
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.636
And why is that?
这是为什么？

203
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.436
It's because if there's no center of your circle,
因为如果你的圆圈没有中心，

204
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.996
there can be no inner rings or outer rings,
那就没有内圆和外圆的区别，

205
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.916
nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion
所有人在你眼中都是同等的，

206
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.140
than anybody else.
都值得怜悯和关心。

207
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.236
And I think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists
我相信这一点是真正将 非凡的利他主义者与大众

208
00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:55.206
from the average person.
区分开来的地方。

209
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.796
But I also think that this is a view of the world that's attainable by many
其实我认为这样一种 世界观是绝大多数人

210
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.796
and maybe even most people.
能够接受和拥有的。

211
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.076
And I think this because at the societal level,
而且由于社会发展的程度，

212
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.720
expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere.
无私与怜悯之心已经在各处扩张。

213
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.196
The psychologist Steven Pinker and others have shown
心理学家史迪芬·平克 以及很多研究者都表明，

214
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.470
that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting
全世界范围内的人 都越来越不能接受

215
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.956
of suffering in ever-widening circles of others,
其他人承受痛苦， 而这个圈子还在不断扩大。

216
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.036
which has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence,
这也就导致人们拒绝 任何方式的残迫与暴力，

217
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.580
from animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment.
从虐待动物到家庭暴力， 再到死刑。

218
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.116
And it's led to increases in all kinds of altruism.
各种无私心都在增长。

219
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.236
A hundred years ago, people would have thought it was ludicrous
一百年前，人们会认为

220
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.756
how normal and ordinary it is
把对陌生人的

221
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.076
for people to donate their blood and bone marrow
无偿献血和骨髓捐献 视为一种平常事，

222
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.740
to complete strangers today.
是绝不可能的。

223
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.636
Is it possible that a hundred years from now
但一百年后，

224
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.236
people will think that donating a kidney to a stranger
人们是否会将捐赠肾脏，

225
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.716
is just as normal and ordinary
视为再也正常不过的事呢？

226
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.756
as we think donating blood and bone marrow is today?
就像今天的无偿献血 与捐献骨髓一样。

227
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.980
Maybe.
也许会的。

228
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.516
So what's at the root of all these amazing changes?
所以到底是为什么 会发生这些改变呢？

229
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.316
In part it seems to be
其中部分原因是，

230
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.540
increases in wealth and standards of living.
生活水平与富裕水平的提升。

231
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.156
As societies become wealthier and better off,
因为社会变得更富裕且更好，

232
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.796
people seem to turn their focus of attention outward,
看起来人们关切的 焦点会向外部转移，

233
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.676
and as a result, all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases,
由此，针对陌生人的 无私之心也会增加,

234
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.420
from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations.
从自愿帮助到慷慨捐赠， 甚至到肾脏捐赠。

235
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.236
But all of these changes also yield
但这些改变同样得出

236
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.476
a strange and paradoxical result,
一个矛盾的结果，

237
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.036
which is that even as the world is becoming a better and more humane place,
尽管这世界变得越来越有爱心，

238
00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:22.210
which it is,
的确是这样，

239
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.996
there's a very common perception that it's becoming worse
同时有一种声音说这个 世界在变得更糟糕，

240
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.060
and more cruel, which it's not.
更残忍，但这不是事实。

241
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.716
And I don't know exactly why this is,
我并不确切地知道 这种声音的由来，

242
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.316
but I think it may be that we now just know so much more
但我想这也许是由于 现在人们能够

243
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.516
about the suffering of strangers in distant places,
了解到更多远距离的新闻，

244
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.956
and so we now care a lot more
而且我们更在意受难的人，

245
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.180
about the suffering of those distant strangers.
尽管这些事并未发生在我们身边。

246
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.756
But what's clear is the kinds of changes we're seeing show
但我们可以确定的是， 我们看到这些变化表明了

247
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.236
that the roots of altruism and compassion
利他主义和怜悯之心的 根源都是人性，

248
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.276
are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence,
如同残忍和暴戾的人性一样，

249
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.996
maybe even more so,
甚至程度更深，

250
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.076
and while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive
同时部分群体对 在遥远的地方受难的人

251
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.196
to the suffering of distant others,
生来敏感，

252
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.996
I really believe that the ability to remove oneself
我确信，摆脱以自我为中心的

253
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.796
from the center of the circle
思考方式，

254
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.876
and expand the circle of compassion outward to include even strangers
扩充自己的怜悯之心， 关心更多的陌生人，

255
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.700
is within reach for almost everyone.
对于大部分的人来说 都是触手可及的。

256
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.116
Thank you.
谢谢。

257
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:20.718
