1
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.719
The sky is inherently democratic.
夜空，是人类与生俱来的共享资源。

2
00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.162
It's accessible, in principle, anyway, by anyone, everywhere,
原则上来说，任何人、在任何地方， 都可以欣赏夜空的美——

3
00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.742
just simply by the act of looking up.
你只需轻轻抬头仰望。

4
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.270
But like so many beautiful things around us,
然而，如同我们身边 很多其它美丽的事物一样，

5
00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:28.258
it's slipping away from us, and we haven't even noticed,
夜空正在逐渐消逝， 而我们却未曾察觉，

6
00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.808
because we're honestly not really looking.
因为，我们根本看都没看一眼。

7
00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.464
So what do we look at instead?
那我们看的究竟事什么呢？

8
00:00:33.488 --> 00:00:37.576
Well, we look at our phones, we look at our computers,
我们在看手机、玩电脑，

9
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.273
we look at screens of all kinds.
我们注视着各种各样的电子屏幕。

10
00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:42.126
And honestly, we rarely even take the trouble
说实在的，我们甚至很少费心

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.498
to look up enough to see each other,
去抬头注视彼此，

12
00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:48.461
let alone taking that next step to looking up at the actual sky.
更不要说走出房门、 抬头仰望真正的天空了。

13
00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:54.459
Now, there's a tendency to think that the loss of our dark night skies
越来越多的人认为，

14
00:00:52.443 --> 00:00:58.028
is the inevitable outcome of progress, change, technology.
夜空的消逝是科技进步、 社会发展的必然结果。

15
00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.530
And you know, that's just simply not true.
但这并不是真正的原因。

16
00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:02.282
Later on, I'll tell you why.
接下来，我将告诉你为什么。

17
00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:06.435
But first, I want to tell you about my experience of the dark night sky.
首先，我想给你们讲讲 我自己有关夜空的经历。

18
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:11.021
I never saw a truly dark night sky until I was 15.
我直到十五岁时， 才见过真正的夜空。

19
00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:12.763
I was here, in Arizona.
当时，我就在亚利桑那州。

20
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.735
I was on a road trip; I pulled over somewhere.
那是一次旅途，我们 在一个地方靠边停了车。

21
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.546
I have no idea where I was, except I know what state.
当时除了州名以外， 我对身在何处一无所知。

22
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.556
And I looked up,
就那么不经意地抬头一望，

23
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.843
and the sky was just filled with an impossible number of stars.
我看到了布满繁星的夜空！

24
00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.772
You see, I'm from New York City,
想想看，我来自纽约，

25
00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:33.863
and in New York, you can see the moon, you can see a couple of stars.
在那个城市，你只能看到 月亮和几颗“零星”，

26
00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:37.056
More often than not, they turn out to be airplanes when they land.
而且通常当“零星”降落时， 你才发现，它们其实是飞机。

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.089
(Laughter)
（笑声）

28
00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:39.719
But there's really not much else.
除此之外，也没什么其它东西了。

29
00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:43.298
As a result, most of my colleagues who are astronomers
我的大多数天文学家同事们，

30
00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:47.391
spent at least part of their youth looking up at the sky in their backyard.
至少都有过一段夜晚在 自家后院数星星的童年时光，

31
00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:49.380
I never really had that experience,
而我，却从未有过那种经历。

32
00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:53.200
and, as a result, I'm really disappointing on camping trips.
所以在露营旅途中， 我的表现令人大失所望：

33
00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:56.107
I don't really know many constellations.
关于星座方面的知识极其有限，

34
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.986
The ones I do know, you probably know them, too.
而我所知道的为数不多的几个星座， 相信在座的各位也都耳熟能详。

35
00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:02.077
But I'll never forget that experience
但我永远不会忘记

36
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.730
of the first time I saw the dark night sky.
平生第一次看到夜空的经历，

37
00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:08.832
And I was just flabbergasted at how many stars there were.
那漫天的繁星深深震撼了我，

38
00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:10.649
And I felt tiny.
让我感到自己无比渺小。

39
00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:17.075
Then I also felt like, "Where's this been hiding this whole time?
接下来，我就有了这样的疑惑： 这些奇景一直以来被藏在了哪里？

40
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.112
Who's been hiding this sky from me?"
是谁藏匿了这样的天空？

41
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.603
Of course, the answer is obvious if you think about it
不过仔细一想， 答案其实显而易见，

42
00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:25.255
or if you look at the picture on the left,
或者看一下左边的照片就明白了，

43
00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:30.001
where you're seeing the same neighborhood taken during a blackout
这是同一街区停电时拍摄的夜空，

44
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.448
versus on an ordinary night.
右边是普通夜晚拍摄的夜空照片。

45
00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:34.957
You can't see the stars if you drown them out with light.
当星星被灯光淹没时， 你自然就看不到它们。

46
00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:37.990
Take a look at our planet.
现在请审视一下我们的地球，

47
00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:39.622
This is our planet from space.
这是从太空拍摄的地球。

48
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.155
Unlike stars, which are hot and glow invisible light so we can see them,
恒星发出热量和不可见光， 所以我们能看到它们，

49
00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.705
our planet is, astronomically speaking, pretty cold.
而地球与恒星不同， 从天文学上讲，地球很冷，

50
00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.058
So it doesn't really glow.
所以其自身并不发光。

51
00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:55.277
When you see the planet looking like a blue-green marble
当你看到图中展现的这颗

52
00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:56.855
the way it does in this picture,
如蓝绿色大理石般的地球时，

53
00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.139
you're seeing it because the sunlight is reflecting off of it,
你能看见它，是因为 它反射了太阳光的缘故。

54
00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:03.746
and that's why you can see the oceans, the clouds, the land.
这也是为什么你能看到 海洋、云朵和陆地。

55
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.673
So if the sun wasn't shining on it,
也就是说，如果没有太阳的照射，

56
00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:07.957
we wouldn't be able to see the earth, right?
我们就看不到地球了，对吗？

57
00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:10.275
Or would we?
或者，我们依然能看到它？

58
00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:13.088
This is our earth at night,
这是夜晚的地球，

59
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:15.223
and it is one of the most striking examples
这是人类在全球范围内

60
00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:18.509
of how we have affected our planet on a global scale.
对地球造成显著影响的例子之一。

61
00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:23.100
You can see light spidering out across the globe everywhere.
你可以看到光亮散播到了 全球的各个角落，

62
00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:26.528
Now, of course, there are broad expanses of ocean that are still dark,
当然，现在广阔的海洋 依旧处于黑暗中，

63
00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:30.466
and in many underdeveloped areas there's still darkness.
很多不发达的地区 看起来也是漆黑一片，

64
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.593
But you'll notice that this is a pretty global effect.
但你会发现这其实 已经成为了全球现象。

65
00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:39.019
We tend to think, when we think of places being lit up,
当提到灯火通明的地方时， 我们总会想起那些最极端的例子，

66
00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:42.871
of very extreme examples -- Times Square, the Vegas Strip.
比如时代广场、拉斯维加斯大道。

67
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.565
But really what that picture shows you
但那张整个地球的照明情况图片

68
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.119
is that it's not just these extreme examples,
显示的不仅仅是这几个极端个例，

69
00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:50.869
it's anywhere that uses outdoor lighting.
而是任何使用户外照明的地方，

70
00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.845
This tends to be a really dramatic effect on the ground.
这往往给地球表面 带来真正巨大的影响。

71
00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:55.710
To understand why,
想知道为什么，

72
00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:58.956
all you really have to do is think about the shape of a lightbulb.
你只需想想灯泡的形状。

73
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.283
The lightbulb, for all practical purposes,
为了实用的目的，

74
00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.674
is more or less round.
灯泡基本上都是圆的。

75
00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.208
This is great for its original intended purpose of lighting up the indoors.
这正符合它最初的 目的——室内照明，

76
00:04:07.232 --> 00:04:09.376
You turn it on, light goes everywhere.
你打开灯，灯光照射到 房间的每个角落。

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.163
An individual light bulb can light up your whole room, more or less.
一个灯泡就能照亮整个房间， 只是明暗程度的差异。

78
00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:16.281
Now, that's great if you're lighting the indoors,
如果你想照亮室内， 这确实非常有效；

79
00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:19.075
but in its application in outdoor lighting,
但当我们用于室外照明时，

80
00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:21.149
that traditional shape of the light bulb,
传统的灯泡形状，

81
00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:24.105
the sort of globe that spreads light everywhere,
即那种向四周传播 光线的球形灯泡，

82
00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.833
is actually very inefficient.
其实是十分低效的。

83
00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:28.239
When you're outdoors, mostly what you care about
当你身处室外时，

84
00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:32.460
is lighting the ground beneath you and your immediate surroundings.
你最关心的是照亮你 脚下的地面和周围的环境。

85
00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:36.362
All of that light that gets scattered outwards and upwards
所有那些分散向外或向上的光，

86
00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:38.816
doesn't actually help you light the area around you.
都并不能帮你有效地 照亮你周围的区域。

87
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.453
What it does is scatters up into the sky
它只是将光线散射到天空，

88
00:04:41.477 --> 00:04:43.528
and becomes what we call "light pollution."
造成我们所说的“光污染”。

89
00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:48.209
Even if you don't care anything about stargazing, this should worry you,
即使你不在意星象观测， 你也应该关心光污染，

90
00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:53.092
because it means that 60-70% of the energy we use to light the outdoors
因为，它意味着我们用于 室外照明的60-70%的能量

91
00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:55.741
is wasted by blotting out the stars.
被浪费在屏蔽夜晚的星光了。

92
00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:00.269
Now, like I said, I'm a big fan of technology.
正如我所说的，我是个大科技迷，

93
00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:03.411
Obviously, I use technology every day; I'm a scientist.
作为一个科学家，显然 每天我都使用高科技。

94
00:05:04.028 --> 00:05:07.237
And there's this tendency to say that it's progress that --
大家倾向于认为这是进步——

95
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:12.361
you know, I'm not suggesting we're going to all go live by candlelight.
我并非建议大家在烛光下生活。

96
00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:16.194
Indeed, technology is allowing us to access the sky
确实，科技使我们能够接近天空，

97
00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:18.670
in ways that are impossible otherwise.
用一种只有科技能够做到的方式，

98
00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:22.999
One of the greatest examples of this is, of course, the Hubble Space Telescope.
当然，最伟大的例子 就是哈勃太空望远镜。

99
00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:26.980
The Hubble went up into space, it returns pictures daily,
哈勃望远镜被发射进入太空， 每天都传回大量照片，

100
00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:28.555
and it allows us to see things
让我们看到太空的事物，

101
00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:31.796
that we are incapable of seeing with our naked eye,
这些都是我们肉眼所看不到的，

102
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.805
in ways that we've never been able to do before in all of human history.
在人类历史的任何阶段， 我们都从没这么做过。

103
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.848
Other examples of this would be planetarium shows.
其它类似的例子 当然还有天体展示。

104
00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:44.044
In the past couple of years, planetarium shows have become more high-tech
在过去的几年里，借助 这些超棒的可视化信息，

105
00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:46.074
with these great visualizations,
天体展示变得越来越高科技化，

106
00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:48.552
and even though this isn't access directly to the sky,
即使这并不是直接亲身接触天空，

107
00:05:48.576 --> 00:05:51.491
it's at least access to our knowledge about the sky.
但至少让我们获得了 关于天空的知识。

108
00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:54.267
And indeed, we can experience the sky in a planetarium
的确，我们可以在天文馆体验那种

109
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.980
in a way that is impossible for us to do
坐在室外、望向漆黑的夜空

110
00:05:56.904 --> 00:05:59.188
just sitting out and looking in the dark.
所体验不到的感觉。

111
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.081
All of you have heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and of planetariums.
你们大概都听说过 哈勃太空望远镜和天文馆。

112
00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:08.074
But there are also ways for technology to enable participation
但是也有一些技术可以

113
00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:10.013
in people's experience of the sky
让人们参与到关于天空的、

114
00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:11.691
that you may not be familiar with.
你可能不熟悉的体验中，

115
00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:14.352
These are called "citizen science projects."
这就是所谓的“平民科学项目”。

116
00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:18.916
Citizen science is when large research projects put their data online,
平民科学是一个大的项目， 他们把数据放到互联网上，

117
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.536
teach ordinary people, like you, to go and interact with that data
教像在座各位这样的普通人 去与数据进行交互，

118
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.567
and actually contribute to the research
通过给数据添加 有趣或必要的特征，

119
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:29.251
by making interesting or necessary characterizations about it.
进而对研究做出贡献。

120
00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:33.526
One such example of this is what I'm showing here, called "Galaxy Zoo."
类似的例子就是我现在 展示的“银河动物园”项目。

121
00:06:34.057 --> 00:06:36.217
Galaxy Zoo is a project
银河动物园项目是这样的：

122
00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:41.544
where people get a 20-minute -- even less than that, actually -- tutorial
人们经过20分钟的指导—— 实际上少于20分钟——

123
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.946
on how to interact with these images of galaxies.
学习关于如何与这些 星系的图像进行交互。

124
00:06:44.684 --> 00:06:46.742
They learn to annotate the images,
他们学习为图像做注释，

125
00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:49.378
and within a couple of minutes, they're up and running,
在几分钟内， 他们就能着手开始工作，

126
00:06:49.402 --> 00:06:51.684
and they're making really useful categorizations
而且真正能够对这些星系

127
00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.708
and classifications of these galaxies.
进行有用的归类和划分。

128
00:06:53.732 --> 00:06:55.241
Now, it's easy to understand
很容易就能理解

129
00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:59.454
why Galaxy Zoo would be an easy sell for people to be involved with:
为何“银河动物园”很容易 被参与其中的人所接受：

130
00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:00.868
it involves pretty pictures;
它包含了漂亮的图片；

131
00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:03.869
galaxies are, generally speaking, pretty attractive.
通常来说，星系的确很吸引人。

132
00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:07.208
However, there are many other flavors of citizen science projects
然而，还有很多其他 类型的平民科学项目，

133
00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:08.884
that people have delved into
人们探究过的这些项目

134
00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:12.276
that have varying levels of abstraction,
抽象程度各不相同，

135
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.046
that you wouldn't necessarily think people would jump at.
你会觉得人们不太会 立刻参与这些项目。

136
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.979
One such example of this is the citizen science project
