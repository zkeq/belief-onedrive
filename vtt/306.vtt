146
00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:25.848
While building the organization in London,
于是决定共同成立 Videre。

147
00:08:26.478 --> 00:08:29.342
we've been traveling undercover to places
在伦敦组建团队的时候，

148
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:36.059
where a community  was suffering from abuses, where mass atrocities were happening,
我们秘密走访了一些饱受摧残、暴力横行，

149
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:39.146
and there was a lack of reporting.
又缺乏曝光的地区。

150
00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:42.941
We tried to understand how we can help.
我们试着了解该如何提供援助。

151
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.610
There were four things that I learned.
我们学到了四点：

152
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.070
The first thing is that we have to engage
首先，我们需要与那些

153
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:54.634
with communities that are living in rural areas, where violations are happening far from the public eye.
遭受暴力却远离公众视线的偏远村庄建立联系。

154
00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.465
We need to partner with them,
我们需要和他们合作，

155
00:08:56.465 --> 00:09:00.386
and we need to understand which images are not making it out there

156
00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:03.294
and help them to document them.
并帮助他们记录下来。

157
00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.462
The second thing I learned
其次，我学到

158
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:09.244
is that we have to enable them  to film in a safe way.
得让他们以一种安全的方式进行拍摄。

159
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:13.623
Security has to be the priority.
安全第一。

160
00:09:13.623 --> 00:09:15.826
Where I used to work before, in the West Bank,
当我还在西岸工作的时候，

161
00:09:15.826 --> 00:09:17.466
one can take a camera out,
你能掏出摄像机，

162
00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:20.159
most likely not going to get shot,
八成也不会被一枪崩了，

163
00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.704
but in places we wanted to work,
但在我们要开展工作的那些地方，

164
00:09:21.704 --> 00:09:26.914
just try to pull a phone out, and you're dead — literally dead.
要敢拿出手机你就死定了，真的死定了。

165
00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:28.444
This is why we decided

166
00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:33.846
to take the operation undercover when necessary, and use mostly hidden cameras.
在必要的时候，尽可能地使用隐形相机进行拍摄。

167
00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:38.665
Unfortunately, I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today — for obvious reasons —
很不幸，我不能给大家展示我们正在使用的偷拍相机，

168
00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:40.917
but these are cameras we used before.

169
00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:43.007
You can buy them off the shelf.

Today, we're building  a custom-made hidden camera,

171
00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:48.468
like the one that Mary was wearing

174
00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:59.644
that blends into the environment, into the surroundings.
可以很好地融入周遭环境。

175
00:09:59.644 --> 00:10:03.092
Now, filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras.
现在，拍摄安全比使用隐形相机本身更重要。

176
00:10:03.092 --> 00:10:07.982
Being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on.
在打开摄像机之前，就得确保安全。

177
00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.034
To keep our partners safe,

we work to understand the risk of every location

The third thing I learned is the importance of verification.

You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,
你能捕捉到惊心动魄的暴行，

184
00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:33.899
but if you can't verify it, it's worth nothing.
但如果无法核实真伪，那它没有任何意义。

185
00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:37.382
Recently, like in the ongoing war  in Syria or the war in Gaza,
近来，在叙利亚，又或者加沙持续的战争中，

186
00:10:37.382 --> 00:10:42.695
we've seen images that are staged  or brought from a different conflict.

这些不实信息不光损害了消息来源的可信度，

190

191
00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:58.252
It starts with vetting the partners,
这都从我们对合作者的审核开始，

192
00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:01.465
understanding who they are, and working with them very intensively.

and looking also at  the metadata of the material.

197
00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:21.017
Now, the fourth and the most important thing I learned

198
00:11:21.017 --> 00:11:25.286
is how you use images  to create a positive change.

the key thing is how you use the material.

mostly local ones, to create awareness.

to change laws.
