﻿1
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.420
This is Pleurobot.
这是一只蝾螈机器人

2
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.836
Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species
是一种我们根据蝾螈设计出的仿生机器人

3
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.260
called Pleurodeles waltl.
我们把它称为蝾螈机器人

4
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.316
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,
就想你看到的，它会爬行

5
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.380
and as you'll see later, it can also swim.
一会儿你还会看到它游泳

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.291
So you might ask, why did we design this robot?
你可能会问我们为什么设计这样一个机器人

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.542
And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
其实，蝾螈机器人是一种用来研究神经科学的工具

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.716
Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists
我们和神经科学家一起设计出蝾螈机器人

9
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.636
to understand how animals move,
希望能更好理解动物的运动原理

10
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.420
and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.
尤其是脊髓控制运动的机理

11
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.076
But the more I work in biorobotics,
但是，我们对仿生机器人的研究越深入

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.481
the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.
就越被动物运动的复杂原理所震撼

13
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.036
If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around,
试想一下在海里遨游的海豚、又跑又跳的小猫

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.636
or even us as humans,
甚至还有我们人类

15
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.476
when you go jogging or play tennis,
在进行慢跑或者打网球的时候

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.740
we do amazing things.
我们的每一个动作都那么神奇

17
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.836
And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
实际上，在运动时，神经系统的控制过程十分复杂

18
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.956
It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly,
神经系统要协调200块左右的肌肉一起运作

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.660
because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
一旦协调紊乱，我们就会摔跤或者肢体不协调

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.100
And my goal is to understand how this works.
而我的目标就是要弄清楚这种协调机制的原理

21
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.820
There are four main components behind animal locomotion.
动物的运动需要四个部分

22
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.556
The first component is just the body,
首先就是肢体

23
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.556
and in fact we should never underestimate
生物力学对于动物肢体运动的简化

24
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.060
to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.
已经到了令人难以想象地步

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.196
Then you have the spinal cord,
第二个部分就是脊髓

26
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.196
and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,
脊髓中有很多反射神经

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.676
multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop
这些反射神经在脊髓中的神经活动和机械活动之间

28
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.180
between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.
建立了感觉协调环

29
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.796
A third component are central pattern generators.
第三个要素是中枢模式发生器

30
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.716
These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals
脊椎动物的脊髓中有一些有趣的电路

31
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.356
that can generate, by themselves,
这些电路在接收简单的信号时

32
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.116
very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity
可以自发地产生非常协调的

33
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.516
while receiving only very simple input signals.
节律运动模式

34
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.756
And these input signals
在我们运动的时候

35
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.836
coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain,
大脑的高级中枢

36
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.556
like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,
例如运动皮层、小脑和基地神经节

37
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.256
will all modulate activity of the spinal cord
进行下行调节并产生上述信号

38
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.196
while we do locomotion.
并对脊髓中的活动起到调控作用

39
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.436
But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component,
但是有趣的是，脊髓和肢体这类低级中枢

40
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.396
the spinal cord, together with the body,
在完成运动过程中

41
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.876
already solve a big part of the locomotion problem.
到底扮演了何种角色

42
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.322
You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken,
大家应该都知道，即使鸡的头被砍掉了

43
00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:09.653
it can still run for a while,
它也不会立即死亡

44
00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:12.196
showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body,
这个事实表明低级的脊髓和躯干

45
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.653
already solve a big part of locomotion.
在完成运动过程中扮演了重要的角色

46
00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:17.676
Now, understanding how this works is very complex,
但是想要弄清楚它的工作原理还是很困难

47
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.996
because first of all,
因为，第一点就是

48
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.640
recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.
想要记录脊髓中的活动十分复杂

49
00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:24.436
It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex
由于脊椎的保护作用，把电极植入到脊髓中

50
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.516
than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.
要比植入到运动皮层中难得多

51
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.356
Especially in humans, very hard to do.
对于人类来说更是难上加难

52
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.156
A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex
另外一个难题就是，运动基于这四个要素的相互作用

53
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.236
and very dynamic interaction between these four components.
是一个复杂的动态过程

54
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.500
So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.
因此，很难区分各要素所发挥的作用

55
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.436
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models
所以，像蝾螈机器人这样的仿生机器人和数学模型

56
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.660
can really help.
就派上用场了

57
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.556
So what's biorobotics?
那么到底什么是仿生机器人学呢

58
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.316
Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics
这是机器人研究中一个热门的领域

59
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.796
where people want to take inspiration from animals
人们试图从动物身上获取灵感

60
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.276
to make robots to go outdoors,
并运用到机器人身上，使它们可以运用于户外

61
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.956
like service robots or search and rescue robots
例如服务用机器人、搜救机器人

62
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.180
or field robots.
以及农业机器人

63
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.396
And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals
现在最大的目标就是从动物身上获得灵感

64
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.756
to make robots that can handle complex terrain --
使机器人能够应对一些复杂的地形

65
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.396
stairs, mountains, forests,
例如楼梯、山区、树林

66
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.436
places where robots still have difficulties
这些地形对于机器人来说还是个挑战

67
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.516
and where animals can do a much better job.
它们并不能像动物那样灵活应对

68
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.036
The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.
机器人也是一项极好的科学研究工具

69
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.680
There are some very nice projects where robots are used,
在一些优秀研究项目中得以应用

70
00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:20.676
like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.
例如神经科学、仿生学和流体动力学

71
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.820
And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.
这也正是蝾螈机器人存在的意义

72
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.356
So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists
所以，我们在实验室里与神经生物学家合作

73
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.596
like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,
法国波尔多大学的神经生物学家 让·玛丽 卡贝肯就是其中之一

74
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.660
and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.
我们制作出脊髓的模型并用机器人加以验证

75
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.916
And here we want to start simple.
我们希望先从简单的动物入手

76
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.916
So it's good to start with simple animals
例如七鳃鳗

77
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.196
like lampreys, which are very primitive fish,
这种原始的鱼类

78
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.716
and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion,
然后慢慢过渡到运动更复杂的动物

79
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.996
like in salamanders,
例如蝾螈

80
00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:45.012
but also in cats and in humans,
然后还有猫、人类

81
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.740
in mammals.
等哺乳动物

82
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.076
And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool
这样一来

83
00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:51.302
to validate our models.
机器人成为一种验证模型的有趣工具

84
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.076
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.
实际上，蝾螈机器人的出现使得我的梦想成真

85
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.356
Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer
因为，大约在20年前

86
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.666
making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion
我在读博士期间就通过计算机

87
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.596
during my PhD.
模拟七鳃鳗和蝾螈的运动

88
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.996
But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.
但是，我一直很清楚我的模拟非常粗糙

89
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.996
Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground,
因为在水中和在泥泞等地形复杂的陆地上的运动

90
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.676
it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.
很难在电脑上精确地模拟出来

91
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.740
Why not have a real robot and real physics?
那么为什么不用机器人真正地模拟这些动作呢

92
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.556
So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.
所以在众多的动物中，蝾螈成为我最喜欢的动物之一

93
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.036
You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian,
你可能会问为什么,因为从进化的角度来看

94
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.916
it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.
蝾螈作为两栖动物,发挥着至关重要的作用

95
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.996
It makes a wonderful link between swimming,
它在两种运动方式间建立起美妙的联系

96
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.916
as you find it in eels or fish,
一个是鳗和鱼类在水中的游泳方式

97
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.060
and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
一个是猫、人类等哺乳动物在陆上的运动方式

98
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.636
And in fact, the modern salamander
事实上，现代的蝾螈

99
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.036
is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate,
和最早出现的陆生脊椎动物十分相近

100
00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.512
so it's almost a living fossil,
所以说，蝾螈就像是活化石一样

101
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.556
which gives us access to our ancestor,
通过它，我们有机会了解我们的祖先

102
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.500
the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
即四足动物的祖先

103
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.436
So the salamander swims
蝾螈以所谓的鳗形游泳的步态

104
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.956
by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait,
在水中游动

105
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.620
so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.
因此肌肉活动产生的优美行波从头部传到尾部

106
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.436
And if you place the salamander on the ground,
如果把它放在地上

107
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.116
it switches to what's called a walking trot gait.
它的动作转变为快速爬行的步态

108
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.683
In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs
在这种情况下，蝾螈的四肢被定期地激活

109
00:05:00.707 --> 00:05:02.316
which are very nicely coordinated
十分协调地

110
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.996
with this standing wave undulation of the body,
随着身体驻波的起伏而运动

111
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.676
and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.
这就是蝾螈机器人行走的步态的原型

112
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.676
Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact
现在令人惊叹的是

113
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.836
is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.
所有这些活动仅靠脊髓和肢体就可以完成

114
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.860
So if you take a decerebrated salamander --
如果拿一只去脑的蝾螈

115
00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.900
it's not so nice but you remove the head --
虽然这听起来有些残忍，但是你把它的头部切除

116
00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:22.596
and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord,
如果以低强度的刺激电激它的脊髓

117
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.876
at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.
它会表现出类似爬行的步态

118
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.356
If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.
但如果你加大刺激的强度，步态就会发生变化

119
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.276
And at some point, there's a threshold,
这里存在一个临界值，如果强度达到临界点

120
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.836
and automatically, the animal switches to swimming.
它会自己变成游泳的步态

121
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.236
This is amazing.
这简直太神奇了

122
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.756
Just changing the global drive,
仅仅改变了刺激的强度

123
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.516
as if you are pressing the gas pedal
就像是踩下了

124
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.606
of descending modulation to your spinal cord,
下行调节脊髓的油门一样

125
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.690
makes a complete switch between two very different gaits.
实现了两种完全不同的步态之间的转变

126
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.836
And in fact, the same has been observed in cats.
而且我们在猫身上发现了同样的规律

127
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.876
If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,
刺激猫的脊髓

128
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.116
you can switch between walk, trot and gallop.
就可以使它在行走、慢跑和快跑之间进行转换

129
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.876
Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking,
还可以实现鸟从行走到拍动翅膀之间的转换

130
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.356
at a low level of stimulation,
相应地，需要从低强度的刺激

131
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.196
and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.
转变为高强度的刺激

132
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.236
And this really shows that the spinal cord
这恰好证明了

133
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.676
is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.
脊髓是一处智能的运动控制中心

134
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.156
So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail,
因此我们对于蝾螈的运动展开更仔细的研究

135
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.276
and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine
我们从德国耶拿大学的马丁·费希尔教授的手中

136
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.876
from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.
得到了一台非常精妙的X射线成像仪

137
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.476
And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine
多亏了这台精妙的仪器

138
00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:16.522
to record all the bone motion in great detail.
我们可以记录更多关于骨骼运动的细节

139
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.236
That's what we did.
这就是我们得到的成像

140
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.436
So we basically figured out which bones are important for us
然后我们大致选出关键的骨骼

141
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.476
and collected their motion in 3D.
并且搜集他们三维运动数据

142
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.196
And what we did is collect a whole database of motions,
我们所做的就是搜集运动过程的全数据

143
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.876
both on ground and in water,
既有在陆地爬行的，也有在水中游行的

144
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.384
to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors
真的是动物

145
00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:32.338
that a real animal can do.
在运动过程中的全部数据

146
00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:35.828
And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.
然后我们这些机器人学家的任务就是 把数据复制到机器人身上

147
00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:39.236
So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure,
因此我们为了找到正确的结构，进行了全套的优化方案

148
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.916
where to place the motors, how to connect them together,
例如在哪里放置这些运动，如何让它们连贯起来

149
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.820
to be able to replay these motions as well as possible.
才能尽可能地重现这些动作

150
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.860
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.
这就是蝾螈机器人诞生的过程

151
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.436
So let's look at how close it is to the real animal.
接下来我们就来欣赏一下 它和活生生的动物多么相似吧

152
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.276
So what you see here is almost a direct comparison
你现在看到的就是非常直观的对比

153
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.996
between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.
一个是活生生的动物，一个是蝾螈机器人

154
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.756
You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay
你可以看到我们几乎实现了两者在步态上

155
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.036
of the walking gait.
一对一的重现

156
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.660
If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.
如果进行慢速回放，你会看得更清楚

157
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.716
But even better, we can do swimming.
但是更神奇的是，我们成功重现了游行

158
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.756
So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --
但我们必须给机器人穿上外套

159
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.876
(Laughter)
（笑声）

160
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.076
and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.
然后就可以入水重现游行的步态

161
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.436
And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.
看到这里我们很是欣慰，因为这个过程真得很艰辛

162
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.676
The physics of interaction are complex.
物理交互作用十分复杂

163
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.116
Our robot is much bigger than a small animal,
因为蝾螈机器人比真正的蝾螈大得多

164
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.196
so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies
所以我们必须进行所谓的动态频率缩放

165
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.556
to make sure we had the same interaction physics.
确保蝾螈机器人能实现一样的物理协调

166
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.996
But you see at the end, we have a very close match,
但是你看，最后两者已经十分相近

167
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.900
and we were very, very happy with this.
对此我们非常高兴

168
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.516
So let's go to the spinal cord.
让我们再回到脊髓的研究

169
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.836
So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen
我们和Jean-Marie Cabelguen教授所做的工作就是

170
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.100
is model the spinal cord circuits.
模拟脊髓中的电路

171
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.996
And what's interesting is that the salamander
但是非常有趣的是，我们发现蝾螈

172
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.640
has kept a very primitive circuit,
始终保持一种非常原始的电路

173
00:07:46.664 --> 00:07:49.316
which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey,
这和我们在七鳃鳗身上发现的很相似

174
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.316
this primitive eel-like fish,
就是那个原始的鳗形鱼类

175
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.076
and it looks like during evolution,
似乎在进化过程中

176
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.036
new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs,
产生了一种新的神经振荡器来控制肢干

177
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.476
to do the leg locomotion.
并完成腿部的运动

178
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.676
And we know where these neural oscillators are
现在我们知道了这些神经振荡器的位置

179
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.956
but what we did was to make a mathematical model
但是我们还需要建立数学模型

180
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.596
to see how they should be coupled
来研究它们是如何连接起来

181
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.556
to allow this transition between the two very different gaits.
实现两种完全不同的步态的转换

182
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.140
And we tested that on board of a robot.
我们在机器人的背部进行测试

183
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.700
And this is how it looks.
就像这个样子

184
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.756
So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot
你现在看到的就是蝾螈机器人的原始版本

185
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.876
that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model
它完全由背部的脊髓模型

186
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.500
programmed on board of the robot.
进行控制

187
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.316
And the only thing we do
然后我们只需要

188
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.516
is send to the robot through a remote control
通过远程控制，向机器人发送

189
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.036
the two descending signals it normally should receive
它在正常情况下从大脑高级部位接受的到的

190
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.660
from the upper part of the brain.
两种下行调节信号

191
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.996
And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals,
有趣的是，通过这些信号

192
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.820
we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.
我们可以完全控制步态的速度，方向和类型

193
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.636
For instance,
举例来说

194
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.236
when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait,
当我们的刺激强度较低时，表现为行走的步态

195
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.236
and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,
当我们加大刺激的强度到某个极限

196
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.420
very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.
它迅速转换成游行的步态

197
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.516
And finally, we can also do turning very nicely
最后，我们也可以很轻松地再变回来

198
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.060
by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.
只需要刺激脊髓的另一端

199
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.646
And I think it's really beautiful
我觉得这真的很美妙

200
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.916
how nature has distributed control
大自然竟然赋予了脊髓

201
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.796
to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord
这么重大的责任

202
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.476
so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.
以至于脑部高级中枢部分根本不需要担心每一块肌肉

203
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.036
It just has to worry about this high-level modulation,
它只需要进行高层调节

204
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.636
and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.
而协调所有的肌肉就是脊髓的任务了

205
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.180
So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.
我们再回到猫的运动，进一步认识仿生学的的重要性

206
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.156
So this is another project
这就是另一个项目了

207
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.596
where we studied cat biomechanics,
我们对猫进行了仿生学研究

208
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.516
and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.
想弄清楚形态学对于肢体动作的影响

209
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.156
And we found three important criteria in the properties,
我们发现，从根本上讲

210
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.780
basically, of the limbs.
躯干具有三个重要的属性

211
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.116
The first one is that a cat limb
首先就是猫的四肢，

212
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.836
more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.
或多或少地类似于受电弓的结构

213
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.076
So a pantograph is a mechanical structure
受电弓是一种机械结构

214
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.500
which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.
它使得上框架和下框架始终保持平行

215
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.516
So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit
如此简单的几何学系统

216
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.356
the internal movement of the segments.
竟能协调上下框架的内部移动

217
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.436
A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.
猫的四肢的第二个属性就是轻盈性

218
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.316
Most of the muscles are in the trunk,
大部分的肌肉都集中在身体

219
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.236
which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia
这真是个好点子，这样一来四肢的惯性就很小

220
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.036
and can be moved very rapidly.
猫就可以灵活地运动

221
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.876
The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb,
最后一个重要的属性是四肢的弹性

222
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.556
so to handle impacts and forces.
可以应对各种冲击和压力

223
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.916
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
我们就是根据这些属性设计出猎豹机器人

224
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.140
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
接下来有请猎豹机器人登场

225
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.636
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot,
这是由彼得埃克特在博士期间研制的机器人

226
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.716
and as you see, it's a cute little robot.
你可以看到，它是一个非常可爱的小型机器人

227
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.996
It looks a bit like a toy,
看起来就像玩具一样

228
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.076
but it was really used as a scientific tool
但它的的确确是一项科研工具

229
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.396
to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
用来研究猫的四肢的属性

230
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.036
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight,
你看，它的四肢十分协调、轻盈

231
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.316
and also very elastic,
并且富有弹性

232
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.116
so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
你可以轻而易举地把它压下去，但它一点事都没有

233
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.596
It will just jump, in fact.
实际上，它只会跳起来

234
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.500
And this very elastic property is also very important.
所以说四肢的弹跳性非常重要

235
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.876
And you also see a bit these properties
你也可以把四肢的三个节段

236
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.300
of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.
看作一个受电弓

237
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.876
Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait
现在，有趣的是这个动态的装置

238
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.796
is obtained purely in open loop,
实现了完全的开环回路

239
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.956
meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.
也就是说没有传感器，也没有复杂的反馈回路

240
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.396
And that's interesting, because it means
这真的很有趣，因为这意味着

241
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.436
that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait,
仅仅靠机器就可以维持这个敏捷的装置的平衡

242
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.636
and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.
并且这个精巧的机器对运动进行了基本的简化

243
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.956
To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion,
在某种程度上，我们甚至可以在运动过程中制造一些障碍

244
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.636
as you will see in the next video,
在接下来的视频是你会看到

245
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.556
where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step,
例如我们做一些实验让机器人下台阶

246
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.196
and the robot will not fall over,
机器人并不会摔倒

247
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.796
which was a surprise for us.
这确实出乎我们的意料

248
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.236
This is a small perturbation.
对于这个细微的干扰

249
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.676
I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over,
我预期机器人会立刻摔倒

250
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.136
because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.
因为它没有传感器，也没有快速反馈回路

251
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.356
But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait,
但是出乎我们的意料，仅仅靠这个机器维持了装着的平衡

252
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.956
and the robot doesn't fall over.
机器人并没有摔倒

253
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.116
Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles,
显然，如果增大跨度，再设置一些障碍

254
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.796
you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.
就需要全控制回路和反射弧等一系列东西

255
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.756
But what's important here is that just for small perturbation,
但是眼下最重要的是，对于一些细微的干扰

256
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.276
the mechanics are right.
仅仅靠机器就可以完成

257
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.396
And I think this is a very important message
我想这对仿生学家、机器人学家和神经学家来说

258
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.611
from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience,
是一个非常重要的信息，那就是：

259
00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:45.315
saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.
不要低估躯干对于运动所发挥的作用

260
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.420
Now, how does this relate to human locomotion?
那么这是如何联系到人类的运动上的呢

261
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.420
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion,
显然，人类的运动比猫和蝾螈的运动更为复杂

262
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.440
but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar
但是另一方面，人类的神经系统

263
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.736
to that of other vertebrates.
和其他脊椎动物的十分相似

264
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.396
And especially the spinal cord
尤其是脊髓

265
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.060
is also the key controller for locomotion in humans.
它同样是人类运动的重要处理中心

266
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.996
That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord,
这就是为什么一旦脊髓受损

267
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.470
this has dramatic effects.
将会导致严重的后果

268
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.316
The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.
例如瘫痪或者四肢麻痹

269
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.716
This is because the brain loses this communication
这是由于大脑与脊髓

270
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.996
with the spinal cord.
之间的信息传递受损

271
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.236
Especially, it loses this descending modulation
尤其是用于引发和调节运动的

272
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.180
to initiate and modulate locomotion.
下行调节机制

273
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.156
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics
所以神经学家的一大目标

274
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.556
is to be able to reactivate that communication
就是通过电刺激或者化学刺激

275
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.020
using electrical or chemical stimulations.
激活两者之间的信息传递

276
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.596
And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that,
世界上有些团队就在研究这一领域

277
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.836
especially at EPFL.
在洛桑联邦理工学院更是如此

278
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.356
My colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera,
例如我的同事格雷瓜尔·库尔蒂纳

279
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.620
with whom I collaborate.
还有西尔维斯特·米切拉

280
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.876
But to do this properly, it's very important to understand
但是为了做好这一点，理解以下几点非常重要

281
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.636
how the spinal cord works,
脊髓是如何工作的

282
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.356
how it interacts with the body,
它是如何与躯干相互作用的

283
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.860
and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.
以及大脑是如何与脊髓进行信息传递的

284
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.516
This is where the robots and models that I've presented today
我今天所呈现的机器人和模型

285
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.436
will hopefully play a key role
就将针对上述重要问题

286
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.116
towards these very important goals.
发挥关键的作用

287

(Applause)
（掌声）

289
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.556
Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots
布鲁诺·朱萨尼：奥克，我在你的实验室 看到一些其他的机器人

290
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.036
that do things like swim in pollution
例如在污水中游泳

291
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.516
and measure the pollution while they swim.
并检测污染程度的机器人

292
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.756
But for this one,
但是你在演讲中提到的蝾螈机器人

293
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.260
you mentioned in your talk, like a side project,
它更像是一个小项目

294
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.676
search and rescue,
它的鼻子上有一个照相机

295
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.876
and it does have a camera on its nose.
可以进行搜救工作

296
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.396
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --
奥克：确实是这样，关于机器人

297
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.849
We have some spin-off projects
我们有很多派生项目

298
00:13:24.873 --> 00:13:28.316
where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection,
我们希望用这些机器人进行搜救和视察工作

299
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.916
so this robot is now seeing you.
所以蝾螈机器人诞生了

300
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.116
And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation
我们设想的是，如果有人陷入困境

301
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.756
like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded,
例如建筑坍塌或者遭遇洪水

302
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.116
and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,
这对救援团队和搜救犬来说都是危险的

303
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.036
why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk,
那么为什么不派一个个既会爬行 又会游行的机器人呢

304
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.236
with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors
它的背部还装有照相机，可以用来 进行侦查、识别幸存者

305
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.036
and possibly create a communication link with the survivor.
甚至可能实现与幸存者的联系

306
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.636
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.
布鲁诺:当然，前提是幸存者没有被机器人的样子吓到

307
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.956
AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit,
奥克:是的，我们将对机器人的外形进行改善

308
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.796
because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack
否则，我猜幸存者可能会被吓出心脏病

309
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.356
just of being worried that this would feed on you.
害怕机器人会吃了他们

310
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.236
But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust,
但是我相信，通过改变它的外形，让它更强健一些

311
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.316
I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.
它将会发挥很重要的作用

312
00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:08.426
BG: Thank you very much. Thank you and your team.
布鲁诺:非常感谢你和你的团队
