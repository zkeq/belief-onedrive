1
00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:18.416
NASA's always on the lookout for possible asteroid collision hazards,
美国航空航天局（NASA）一直在进行 天文观测，以避免小行星碰撞的危险，

2
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.520
so the Pan-STARRS telescope is scanning the sky every night.
因此泛星计划的望远镜 每晚都在扫描天空。

3
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:27.191
Each morning, candidate objects are examined by Pan-STARRS staff
每天早上，泛星计划的工作人员 都会检查那些候选星体，

4
00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:30.422
and usually discovered to be no big deal.
通常的结果都是：没有问题。

5
00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:33.185
But on October 19, 2017,
但是2017年的10月19日，

6
00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:37.861
Pan-STARRS spotted an object moving rapidly between the stars,
泛星计划发现了一个 在星系间快速移动的物体，

7
00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:42.203
and this time the usual follow-up measurements of position and speed
这一次，例行的 位置和速度测量结果

8
00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:45.042
showed something completely different.
显示了完全不一样的结果。

9
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.571
By October 22nd, we had enough data
到10月22日，我们有了足够的数据

10
00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:51.765
to realize that this object wasn't from our solar system.
证明这个物体不是来自太阳系。

11
00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.130
Holy cow.
我的天。

12
00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:54.901
That's when I got the phone call,
我就是在那天接到的电话，

13
00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:58.931
the phone call that all solar system astronomers are waiting for.
所有研究太阳系的天文学家 都在等这个电话。

14
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:01.066
Let me tell you how exciting this was.
我来告诉你们这件事有多让人激动。

15
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.097
(Laughter)
（笑声）

16
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.242
NASA's been expecting to see an interstellar comet
从20世纪70年代开始， NASA就想找到一颗

17
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.606
pass through the solar system since the 1970s,
跨星际飞行的彗星，能横穿太阳系，

18
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.488
but until now, we'd never seen anything.
但直到现在都没有任何发现。

19
00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:14.138
Our own solar system is huge,
我们的太阳系很大，

20
00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:17.471
so even getting a package from the nearest star system
即使从最近的、 离我们4.4光年的恒星系统

21
00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.598
4.4 light years away
发点东西过来，

22
00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:22.204
would take over 50,000 years.
也需要5万年那么久。

23
00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:24.273
So this is a really big deal.
因此这件事真的非常重要。

24
00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:27.267
The interstellar visitor entered our solar system
这位星际访客是从行星平面上方，

25
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.141
from above the plane of the planets,
从天琴座的方向

26
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.998
coming from the direction of the constellation Lyra,
进入我们的太阳系的，

27
00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:35.458
and it passed closest to the Sun on September 9th,
它在9月9日经过了近日点，

28
00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:37.887
passing inside the orbit of Mercury.
从水星轨道内穿过。

29
00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:42.558
Now this isn't a particularly close approach or unusual distance.
这个距离其实不算近， 属于正常范围。

30
00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:46.291
It's just much easier to see objects close by.
但是已经让我们的观测 变得容易多了。

31
00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:48.620
On October 14th,
在10月14日，

32
00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:52.746
before we discovered it, it made its closest approach to the Earth,
在我们发现它之前， 它已经掠过了近地点，

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460
within about 15 million miles.
差不多在1500万英里之内。

34
00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.241
This is really close by astronomical standards.
就天文学的标准来说， 这已经相当近了。

35
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:03.637
Now rather than call this by its unwieldy catalog name,
我们没有按照枯燥的 目录命名来称呼它，

36
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.304
we briefly called it "Rama,"
我们叫它“拉玛”，

37
00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:09.836
after the cylindrical spacecraft that passed through the solar system
名字来自于阿瑟 · C · 克拉克 1973年的经典科幻小说

38
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.074
in Arthur C. Clarke's classic science fiction story in 1973.
里面那艘穿过太阳系的 圆柱形宇宙飞船。

39
00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:17.762
But this wasn't quite right either,
但其实这个名字也不太合适，

40
00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:21.019
so in honor of it being discovered by a telescope in Hawaii,
因为发现它的望远镜是在夏威夷，

41
00:02:21.043 --> 00:02:24.440
we consulted two experts on Hawaiian culture --
于是我们找了两位夏威夷文化的专家，

42
00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:26.917
a Hawaiian navigator and a linguist --
一位夏威夷向导和一位语言学家，

43
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.683
to propose a name.
来想一个名字。

44
00:02:28.707 --> 00:02:31.691
And they suggested "'Oumuamua,"
他们提议叫“奥陌陌”，

45
00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:36.770
which means scout or messenger from the distant past reaching out to us.
意思是经过长途跋涉 找到我们的侦察兵或者信使。

46
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:41.158
Now this discovery was important for many reasons,
这个发现之所以重要，有很多原因，

47
00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:45.018
but to me the most significant is for what 'Oumuamua can tell us
但我认为最有意义的是， 奥陌陌能告诉我们

48
00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:47.459
about the past of our solar system.
我们太阳系的过去。

49
00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.230
The process of the birth of a new solar system and the growth of planets
一个新的恒星系统的诞生 和行星的成长

50
00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:55.336
can be a violent and messy business.
是一个剧烈而混乱的过程。

51
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.583
Leftover icy and rocky debris gets ejected from the new solar system
多余的冰和岩石碎屑 被甩出这个新生的恒星系统。

52
00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:02.956
as the giant planets migrate through the dusty disk
巨大的行星从它们诞生的尘埃中

53
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.908
out of which they're formed.
穿越而过。

54
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:09.975
Now have you ever felt an emotional chill,
你们有没有感受过情绪的震颤，

55
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.800
something that's so exciting that a shiver runs up and down your spine?
就是有件事让你很激动， 一阵颤抖的感觉沿着你的脊柱上下？

56
00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:18.871
Or something that's very emotionally moving?
或者让你觉得非常受感动？

57
00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.245
Well this was it for me.
我当时就是这种感觉。

58
00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.094
This was my wow moment.
这是我的惊喜时刻。

59
00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:27.006
We actually had a piece of material from another solar system
有一块从其他星系过来的物质

60
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.689
coming close enough for us to observe.
离得够近，可以让我们观察。

61
00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:34.471
So what would you like to know about 'Oumuamua,
关于奥陌陌，你们想知道些什么呢，

62
00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:37.526
the very first visitor from another star system?
它是第一位来自另一个星系的访客。

63
00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:41.062
Well, I could think of a million things,
我可以想到一百万件事，

64
00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.666
but there's what you want and what you can have,
但是现实和理想总是有差距的，

65
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.024
and 'Oumuamua was moving away and fading very rapidly.
奥陌陌当时正在离我们而去， 消失得非常快。

66
00:03:49.048 --> 00:03:51.249
In the span of about a week,
在差不多一周的时间里，

67
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.944
it had dropped in brightness by a factor of [10].
它的亮度就下降了百分之一。

68
00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:57.088
So this is about all the time we were going to have
因此我们能用来方便地研究它的时间

69
00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.999
to study it easily.
非常有限。

70
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.432
So we had to distill the process of getting telescope time --
因此我们要加快申请使用望远镜，

71
00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:07.996
normally a very competitive, peer-reviewed proposal process
申请过程充满竞争、手续繁杂，

72
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.868
that can take up to months --
通常要花几个月的时间，

73
00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:12.591
down to less than a few days.
而我们只有几天的时间。

74
00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:16.360
So began a "polite" competition for resources.
于是开始了一场 “礼貌地”争夺资源的竞争。

75
00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:20.022
OK, let me not mince words. It was a fierce battle.
好吧，还是不要说反话了。 那是一场激烈的战斗。

76
00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:21.814
We dropped everything,
我们放下了所有的事情，

77
00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:23.284
working around the clock,
跟时间赛跑，

78
00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:27.189
trying to craft perfectly crafted proposal words
试图写出一篇完美的申请报告

79
00:04:27.213 --> 00:04:29.458
to send to the observatory directors.
发给天文台台长。

80
00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:33.195
Well, good news. We got the time.
好在事遂人愿， 我们申请到了使用时间。

81
00:04:33.998 --> 00:04:37.561
Now, from a perfectly selfish point of view,
从非常私人的观点出发，

82
00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:41.951
the first thing we might like to know is how massive 'Oumuamua is.
我们想要了解的第一件事 可能是奥陌陌的质量是多少。

83
00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:44.815
Because after all, it passed very close to the Earth,
因为毕竟它曾经离地球非常近，

84
00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:47.854
and we didn't know about it until afterwards.
而我们发现它的时候它已经远离了。

85
00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:52.878
How bad would this have been had it not missed the Earth?
如果它撞上地球，会有多糟糕？

86
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.572
Well, the impact energy
撞击的能量

87
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:59.205
depends on the square of the velocity times its mass,
取决于速度的平方乘以它的质量，

88
00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.825
and the mass depends on how big it is and what it's made of.
而质量取决于它有多大， 以及由什么物质组成。

89
00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:06.888
So how big is 'Oumuamua, and what's its shape?
那么奥陌陌有多大呢？ 形状又是什么样？

90
00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:09.905
Well, we can get this from its brightness.
我们能从它的亮度上来判断。

91
00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:12.896
Now, if you don't believe me, think of comparing the brightness
如果你不相信的话， 想象一下，我们来比较两者的亮度，

92
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.302
of a firefly in your backyard
一个是你后院的萤火虫

93
00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:18.746
to the navigation lights on a distant airplane.
一个是远处飞机上的导航灯。

94
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.742
You know the airplane is much brighter --
飞机的灯肯定更亮，

95
00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:23.466
it just appears faint because it's so far away.
它看起来比较暗淡是因为离得远。

96
00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.429
We're also going to need to know
我们还需要知道

97
00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:29.603
how reflective the surface of 'Oumuamua is,
奥陌陌的表面反射情况，

98
00:05:29.627 --> 00:05:31.737
and we don't have any clue,
我们没有任何线索，

99
00:05:31.761 --> 00:05:35.621
but it's reasonable to assume it's very similar to small asteroids
但是可以有依据地猜测， 应该跟我们太阳系中的

100
00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:37.627
and comets in our solar system,
小行星和卫星很相似。

101
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:39.001
or in technical terms,
或者用技术性的描述，

102
00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:43.238
something between the reflectivity of charcoal and wet sand.
它的反射率应该介于 木炭和潮湿的沙子之间。

103
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:49.916
Nowadays, most of the big telescopes are used in what's called a service mode,
如今，大多数大型望远镜 都在以所谓服务模式运行，

104
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.796
meaning we have to carefully develop all the instructions
就是说我们要仔细地准备 所有的操作流程，

105
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.369
and send them to the telescope operator,
然后发给望远镜操作员，

106
00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:59.322
and then anxiously wait for the data to come back,
之后就是焦急地等待数据发过来，

107
00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:01.569
praying to the weather gods.
同时向天气之神祈祷。

108
00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:03.894
Now I bet most of you don't have careers
我打赌你们都没做过这种工作，

109
00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:08.729
that critically depend on whether or not it's cloudy last night.
成败与否极度依赖于头天晚上 是不是多云的天气。

110
00:06:08.753 --> 00:06:11.920
Well, we weren't going to get any second chances here.
我们不再会有第二次机会。

111
00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:16.052
Because the weather was great, 'Oumuamua decided not to be.
因为天气很不错，于是奥陌陌 给我们带来一点挑战。

112
00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.076
Its brightness wasn't constant.
它的亮度不是很恒定。

113
00:06:18.552 --> 00:06:21.767
Now here we see 'Oumuamua racing between the stars.
我们现在看到的是奥陌陌 在星星之间穿梭。

114
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:23.370
It's centered in the middle.
它被放在了中间。

115
00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:27.314
The stars are trailed out because the telescope is following its motion.
星星在移动，因为望远镜 是跟着奥陌陌走的。

116
00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:33.417
It started faint and then it got brighter, fainter, brighter, and fainter again,
它一会儿变暗，一会儿变亮，不停反复，

117
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:38.266
as sunlight is reflected off of four sides of an oblong object.
因为这个长方形物体的 四个面都会反射阳光。

118
00:06:39.122 --> 00:06:41.552
The extreme brightness change
这种急剧的亮度变化

119
00:06:41.576 --> 00:06:45.881
led us to an unbelievable conclusion about its shape.
让我们得出了关于它形状的 非常难以置信的结论。

120
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.898
As shown in this artist's impression,
根据艺术家制作的效果图，

121
00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:51.453
'Oumuamua is apparently very long and narrow,
奥陌陌显然又长又窄，

122
00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:54.580
with an axis ratio of about 10 to one.
长短轴比差不多是10比1。

123
00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:59.212
Assuming it's dark, this means it's about half a mile long.
假设它是黑色的， 那就意味着它有800米长。

124
00:06:59.807 --> 00:07:03.355
Nothing else in our solar system looks like this.
太阳系里从未有过这样的天体。

125
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.817
We only have a handful of objects that even have an axis ratio
我们观测到的长短轴比 超过5比1的天体

126
00:07:06.841 --> 00:07:08.555
bigger than five to one.
也非常少。

127
00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:11.085
So we don't know how this forms,
我们不清楚它是怎么形成的，

128
00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:16.307
but it may be part of its birth process in its home solar system.
但可能跟它在自己星系中的 形成过程有关。

129
00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:22.838
'Oumuamua was varying in brightness every 7.34 hours,
奥陌陌的亮度 每7.34小时就发生变化，

130
00:07:22.862 --> 00:07:24.608
or so we thought.
至少我们是这么认为的。

131
00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:26.974
As more data started to come in from other teams,
其他团队的数据陆续发来，

132
00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:29.456
they were reporting different numbers.
他们上报的数据有所不同。

133
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.406
Why is it the more we learn about something,
为什么我们对一件事情了解越多，

134
00:07:31.426 --> 00:07:33.366
the harder it gets to interpret?
就越难将它解释清楚呢？

135
00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:37.805
Well, it turns out that 'Oumuamua is not rotating in a simple way.
事实上，奥陌陌并不是简单地在旋转。

136
00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:39.888
It's wobbling like a top.
而是像陀螺一样在摇晃。

137
00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:42.998
So while it is rotating around its short axis,
它在绕自己短轴旋转的同时，

138
00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:45.872
it's also rolling around the long axis
也在绕长轴翻转，

139
00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:47.966
and nodding up and down.
同时上下摇晃。

140
00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:51.533
This very energetic, excited motion
这种有力的、激烈的运动形式，

141
00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:55.017
is almost certainly the result of it being violently tossed
几乎可以肯定，是因为它被猛烈地

142
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.963
out of its home solar system.
抛出了自己的太阳系。

143
00:07:58.183 --> 00:08:00.974
Now how we interpret the shape from its brightness
我们如何通过它的亮度 来解释它的形状，

144
00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:03.870
depends very critically on how it's spinning,
很大程度上取决于它的旋转方式，

145
00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:06.864
so now we have to rethink what it may look like,
因此我们不得不重新猜测它的样子，

146
00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:10.333
and as shown in this beautiful painting by space artist Bill Hartmann,
正如太空画家比尔 · 哈特曼 这幅漂亮的画作所展示的一样，

147
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:14.316
we think that 'Oumuamua may be more of a flattened oval.
我们认为奥陌陌可能 更像一个扁平的椭圆。

148
00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:17.604
So let's get back to the energetics.
让我们说回它的能量。

149
00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:19.539
What is it made of?
它是由什么构成的？

150
00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:22.787
Well, ideally we would love to have a piece of 'Oumuamua
当然，最理想的方式是 我们能拿到一片奥陌陌的样本，

151
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:26.009
into the laboratory, so we could study it in detail.
送到实验室仔细研究。

152
00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:29.700
But since even private industry can't manage to launch
但是即便是私人企业也无法在一周内

153
00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:31.486
a spacecraft within a week
发射宇宙飞船，

154
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.177
to something like this,
飞往这样一个目标，

155
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.362
astronomers have to rely on remote observations.
天文学家们不得不依靠遥控观测，

156
00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:40.331
So astronomers will look at how the light interacts with the surface.
他们观察光线如何与表面互动。

157
00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:44.521
Some colors may get absorbed, giving it a chemical fingerprint,
有些颜色的光线可能会被吸收， 给它留下一个化学指纹，

158
00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:46.792
whereas other colors may not.
而其他的颜色则不会。

159
00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:51.069
On the other hand, some substances may just reflect more blue
换句话说，有些物体 会反射更多蓝色的光

160
00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:52.911
or red light efficiently.
或者红色的光。

161
00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:57.202
In the case of 'Oumuamua, it reflected more red light,
而奥陌陌，会反射更多的红光，

162
00:08:57.226 --> 00:09:02.249
making it look very much like the organic rich surface of the comet recently visited
使它看起来很像罗塞塔号 最近造访的那颗彗星

163
00:09:02.273 --> 00:09:04.059
by the Rosetta spacecraft.
富含有机物的表面。

164
00:09:04.707 --> 00:09:09.438
But not everything that looks reddish has the same composition.
但并不是所有看起来 发红的物体都有相同的成分。

165
00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:12.938
In fact, minerals that have tiny little bits of iron in the surface
实际上，表面含有少量铁的矿物质

166
00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:14.899
can also look red,
看起来也是红色的，

167
00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:17.773
as does the dark side of Saturn's moon Iapetus,
就像土星的卫星伊阿珀托斯的暗面，

168
00:09:17.797 --> 00:09:20.582
shown in these images from the Cassini spacecraft.
从卡西尼号航天器 拍下的照片中就可以看出来。

169
00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:23.443
Nickel-iron meteorites, in other words, metal,
镍铁陨石，换句话说，就是金属，

170
00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:25.196
can also look red.
也可能呈红色。

171
00:09:25.852 --> 00:09:28.522
So while we don't know what's on the surface,
既然我们无法得知表面有什么，

172
00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:31.692
we know even less about what's on the inside.
就更无从知晓 它的内部由什么构成了。

173
00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:35.343
However, we do know that it must at least be strong enough
但我们至少确定它足够坚固

174
00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.739
to not fly apart as it rotates,
才不会在旋转中解体，

175
00:09:37.763 --> 00:09:41.723
so it probably has a density similar to that of rocky asteroids;
因此它的密度 应该跟石质的小行星类似，

176
00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.239
perhaps even denser, like metal.
也许更大，接近金属。

177
00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:47.196
Well, at the very least, I want to show you
至少，我想给大家看一眼

178
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.062
one of the beautiful color images that we got
我们的一架地基天文望远镜

179
00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:51.526
from one of the ground-based telescopes.
拍到的一张漂亮的彩色照片。

180
00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:54.964
All right, I admit, it's not all that spectacular.
好吧，我承认，并没有那么漂亮。

181
00:09:54.988 --> 00:09:56.000
(Laughter)
（笑声）

182
00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:58.983
We just don't have the resolution.
分辨率不够高。

183
00:09:59.007 --> 00:10:00.936
Even Hubble Space Telescope
即便是哈勃太空望远镜

184
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.009
doesn't present a much better view.
也无法拍得更好。

185
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.453
But the importance of the Hubble data was not because of the images,
但是哈勃提供的数据的重要性， 并不在于它拍摄的照片，

186
00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:09.969
but because it extended our observations out
而是它将我们的观察期

187
00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.676
to two and a half months from the discovery,
延长到了自发现起的2个半月，

188
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.404
meaning we get more positions along the orbit,
意味着我们能获得它 轨道的更多位置，

189
00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:19.904
which will hopefully let us figure out where 'Oumuamua came from.
也就有希望弄清楚奥陌陌来自哪里。

190
00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:24.240
So what exactly is 'Oumuamua?
那么，奥陌陌到底是什么？

191
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:30.493
We firmly believe it's likely to be a leftover archaeological remnant
我们坚信，它应该是另一个行星系统

192
00:10:30.517 --> 00:10:34.105
from the process of the birth of another planetary system,
在诞生时留下的遗迹，

193
00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:35.977
some celestial driftwood.
一些天体漂流木。

194
00:10:36.413 --> 00:10:39.796
Some scientists think that maybe 'Oumuamua formed
有些科学家认为， 奥陌陌在形成的时候

195
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.415
very close to a star that was much denser than our own,
离一颗恒星非常近， 这颗恒星比太阳密度要大，

196
00:10:43.439 --> 00:10:46.852
and the star's tidal forces shredded planetary material
在它形成的早期，潮汐力将

197
00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:48.726
early in the solar system's history.
许多行星物质撕裂了。

198
00:10:49.385 --> 00:10:53.346
Still others suggest that maybe this is something that formed
而另一些人认为， 奥陌陌也许诞生于

199
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.536
during the death throes of a star,
某颗恒星生命的晚年，

200
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.352
perhaps during a supernova explosion,
也许是在超新星爆发阶段，

201
00:10:58.376 --> 00:11:00.988
as planetary material got shredded.
行星物质被撕碎。

202
00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:05.673
Whatever it is, we believe it's a natural object,
无论原因是什么， 我们都相信它是自然形成的，

203
00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:09.958
but we can't actually prove that it's not something artificial.
但我们也无法证明它不是人造的。

204
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.887
The color, the strange shape, the tumbling motion
它的颜色，奇怪的形状， 翻滚的动作模式，

205
00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:16.022
could all have other explanations.
都有可能完全是另一种解释。

206
00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:20.265
Now while we don't believe this is alien technology,
既然我们不相信 这是外星人的技术，

207
00:11:20.289 --> 00:11:24.931
why not do the obvious experiment and search for a radio signal?
那为什么不做个简单的实验， 搜索一下无线电信号呢？

208
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.400
That's exactly what the Breakthrough Listen project did,
这就是“突破监听计划”在做的，

209
00:11:28.424 --> 00:11:32.126
but so far, 'Oumuamua has remained completely quiet.
但到目前为止， 奥陌陌依然是静默状态。

210
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:35.690
Now could we send a spacecraft to 'Oumuamua
那我们能不能发射 一艘宇宙飞船去追赶奥陌陌，

211
00:11:35.714 --> 00:11:38.058
and answer this question once and for all?
一次性搞清楚所有的问题呢？

212
00:11:38.082 --> 00:11:40.333
Yes, we do actually have the technology,
没错，从技术上来说完全可行，

213
00:11:40.357 --> 00:11:42.746
but it would be a long and expensive voyage,
但这将是一场漫长而昂贵的远航，

214
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.048
and we would get there so far from the Sun
我们会离开太阳非常远，

215
00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:48.365
that the final approach trajectory would be very difficult.
计算最后的对接轨道将非常困难。

216
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.681
So I think 'Oumuamua probably has many more things to teach us,
因此我觉得，奥陌陌 还可以教我们很多事情，

217
00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:57.118
and in fact there might be more surprises in store
事实上，随着包括我在内的 科学家们继续研究数据，

218
00:11:57.142 --> 00:12:01.197
as scientists such as myself continue to work with the data.
应该还有更多惊喜在等着我们。

219
00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.489
More importantly, I think this visitor from afar
更重要的是，这位远道而来的访客

220
00:12:05.513 --> 00:12:10.275
has really brought home the point that our solar system isn't isolated.
证明了一点，我们的太阳系 并不是孤立的。

221
00:12:10.672 --> 00:12:13.086
We're part of a much larger environment,
我们是一个更大世界的一部分，

222
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.974
and in fact, we may even be surrounded by interstellar visitors
实际上，我们周围 可能有许多星际访客，

223
00:12:17.998 --> 00:12:20.031
and not even know it.
而我们还没有察觉。

224
00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:22.167
This unexpected gift
这件意外的礼物

225
00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:26.778
has perhaps raised more questions than its provided answers,
带来的疑问可能 比它解答的问题还要多，

226
00:12:26.802 --> 00:12:32.127
but we were the first to say hello to a visitor from another solar system.
但我们是第一批对来自 其他星系的客人打招呼的人。

227
00:12:32.532 --> 00:12:33.714
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

228
00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:40.722
(Applause)
（掌声）

229
00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:44.221
Jedidah Isler: Thanks, Karen.
吉迪达 · 伊斯勒：谢谢凯伦。

230
00:12:44.245 --> 00:12:46.627
I of course enjoyed that talk very much. Thank you.
我非常喜欢这次演讲，谢谢你。

231
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.204
As I recall, we found it pretty late in its journey towards us.
我回顾了一下演讲内容，我们 发现它的时候已经非常晚了。

232
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:53.840
Will future technologies like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
未来的科技，比如 大型综合巡天望远镜，

233
00:12:53.864 --> 00:12:55.577
help us detect these things sooner?
是否能帮我们更早一点 发现这样的物体呢？

234
00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:59.918
Karen Meech: Yeah. We're hoping that we'll start to see a lot of these things,
凯伦 · 梅赫：是的，我们希望 能发现很多这样的天体，

235
00:12:59.942 --> 00:13:03.761
and ideally, you'd love to find one as it's approaching the Sun,
理想的是，最好能有一颗 正在向太阳靠近，

236
00:13:03.785 --> 00:13:06.801
because you want to have time to do all the science,
这样就有时间来进行研究，

237
00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:08.022
or even more ideal,
更理想的是，

238
00:13:08.046 --> 00:13:10.111
you'd get a spacecraft ready to go,
有一艘飞船时刻准备着，

239
00:13:10.135 --> 00:13:13.285
parked somewhere in the L4 or L5 position,
停在L4或者L5的位置，

240
00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:14.643
somewhere near Earth,
靠近地球，

241
00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:17.658
so that when something comes by, you can chase it.
这样如果有东西飞过， 就能进行追踪。

242
00:13:17.682 --> 00:13:20.231
JI: Awesome, thanks so much. Let's thank Karen again.
吉迪达 · 伊斯勒：太棒了， 非常感谢。再次感谢凯伦。
