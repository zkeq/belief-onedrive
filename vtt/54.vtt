I decide to redeclare my obsession.

that some people instinctively flinch when I merely describe the sound,
有些人只是听我形容那种声音 就会本能的退缩，

144
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:13.202
like it's painful just to think about it.
好像只要谈到它就很痛苦。

145
00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.405
Then I meet Amy Hume.
之后我认识了艾米 · 休谟。

146
00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:18.024
She's a voice coach.
一名发声教练。

147
00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:20.736
And she blows my mind.
她所说的话让我感到很惊讶。

148
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.143
Because she tells me that the female voice
她告诉我 11 到 13 岁

149
00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.618
between the ages of 11 and 13
女孩的声音

150
00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:28.610
is one of the most interesting things to study.
是研究起来最有趣的事物之一。

151
00:07:28.634 --> 00:07:29.792
Why?
为什么？

152
00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:32.094
Because there's this research by Carol Gilligan
因为根据卡罗尔 · 吉利根所做的研究，

153
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.507
that says that is the age
那个年龄段是

154
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:36.768
when girls begin to perform and alter their voices.
女生开始表演和改变自己声音的阶段。

155
00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:40.165
For example, adding breath for maturity,
例如，为了表现得成熟 而在声音中加气音，

156
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:42.959
(Imitating vocal fry) or adding vocal fry for apathy.
或者用气泡音来表现得淡漠。

157
00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:45.054
(Laughter)
（笑声）

158
00:07:45.078 --> 00:07:47.849
But tell me, according to this research,
你们猜猜，根据这项研究，

159
00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:51.730
when do you reckon boys begin to perform and alter their voices?
你们觉得男孩们是从几岁开始 开始表演与改变他们的声音的？

160
00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:52.944
Now, I guessed 18,
我猜是 18 岁，

161
00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:55.301
because "men mature later," right?
因为“男生成熟的晚”，对吗？

162
00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:57.492
Wrong.
错了。

163
00:07:57.516 --> 00:07:59.573
The answer was four years old.
答案是四岁。

164
00:07:59.597 --> 00:08:03.383
Because that is when boys learn not to cry or squeal.
那时起，男孩学会不去哭 和不尖声说话。

165
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.183
That those are not manly sounds.
因为那不是男子汉会发出的声音。

166
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.811
And that's when I realized
而我也是在那时才觉得

167
00:08:08.835 --> 00:08:12.579
that a fangirl's shriek is therefore like a superpower.
饭圈女孩的尖叫因此 像是一种超能力。

168
00:08:13.548 --> 00:08:14.810
(Laughter)
（笑声）

169
00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:18.737
Because it's this fearless and honest expression
因为那是一种无畏的， 真诚的情感表达

170
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:21.130
of pure celebration and joy,

171
00:08:21.154 --> 00:08:22.975
and it's a sound
那是一种

172
00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:25.399
they have not forgotten how to make.
她们还没有忘记该怎么去发出的声音。

173
00:08:26.524 --> 00:08:29.675
I actually reckon that fangirls have a second superpower,
而且我认为饭圈女孩还有 第二种超能力，

174
00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:31.476
because they know how to do something
因为她们有去做某事的能力，

175
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.603
that most of my adult friends have no idea how to do.
而这种能力我大多数成年朋友都没有。

176
00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:39.262
Fangirls know how to love something without apology or fear.
饭圈女孩知道如何没有 歉意与恐惧地去爱一样事物。

177
00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:42.024
My years of researching fangirls
经过我多年来对饭圈女孩的研究，

178
00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:44.151
culminated in this determination
我最终决定

179
00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:47.262
to write something that celebrates and vindicates them.
要写些什么来歌颂饭圈女孩， 为她们正名。

180
00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:50.476
So I decided to make this thriller comedy musical
我觉得要制作一个 带有惊悚和喜剧风格的音乐剧。

181
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.754
that sounds like a Beyoncé concert meets rave meets church.
这个音乐剧听上去像是混杂着 狂欢和教堂元素的碧昂斯的演唱会。

182
00:08:54.256 --> 00:08:55.723
I called it "Fangirls,"
我将其取名为《饭圈女孩》，

183
00:08:55.747 --> 00:08:58.484
and I designed it like a Trojan horse.
我把它设计的像是一个特洛伊木马一样。

184
00:08:58.508 --> 00:09:00.754
So it appears to make fun of these young women,
看上去是为了取笑那些年轻的姑娘们，

185
00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:03.121
only to, like, smuggle them into your heart.
实际上，是为了偷偷地 把她们装进你们的心里。

186
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:05.707
(Laughter)
（笑声）

187
00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:07.170
Thanks.
谢谢。

188
00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.414
(Applause)

189
00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:11.255
At one point --

190
00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.430
Thanks.
谢谢。

191
00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:14.905
At one point, a girl sings,
某一刻，一个女生唱到：

192
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.826
"Why should I hide my feelings?
“为什么我要隐藏我的情感？

193
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.587
Because they annoy you?

194
00:09:18.611 --> 00:09:21.317
Or because it isn't what the boys do?"
还是因为这些不是男孩们会做的事？”

195
00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:24.127
And as a former fangirl cynic,
作为一名曾鄙视过饭圈女孩的人，

196
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.904
that is the question that I want to leave you all with.
这是一个我希望大家都能去想想的问题。

197
00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:29.810
Why should fangirls tone it down?
为什么饭圈女孩要收敛她们的情感？

198
00:09:29.834 --> 00:09:31.461
Because they're crazy?
因为她们疯了吗？

199
00:09:31.485 --> 00:09:33.921
Or because our definition of "reasonable"
还是因为我们其实是根据

200
00:09:33.945 --> 00:09:36.825
is based on what it is acceptable for men to do?
男性能被人认可的行为 而定义“理性”这个词的？

201
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:41.218
What if we rethink the judgments we've been conditioned to feel
当我们看到年轻姑娘们 带着激动的心情尖叫着的时候

202
00:09:41.242 --> 00:09:44.901
when we see young women screaming their lungs out with excitement?
我们能不能重新想想 那些对她们的惯有看法？

203
00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:47.508
What if we decided to rethink the words we use
我们能不能重新想想 该用什么样的词语

204
00:09:47.532 --> 00:09:48.953
to describe that joy,

205
00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:52.889
and what if we didn't allow ourselves to diminish girls

206
00:09:52.913 --> 00:09:55.789
with words that undermine their intelligence,

207
00:09:55.813 --> 00:09:58.551
their interests and their capability?
兴趣与能力的词语来形容她们？

208
00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:01.551
Because, according to my research,

209
00:10:01.575 --> 00:10:05.500
they are capable of building a shrine to Harry Styles's vomit

210
00:10:05.524 --> 00:10:08.326
on the side of a freeway within two hours.
把哈里 · 斯泰尔斯在高速公路旁 的呕吐地点改造成一个圣地。

211
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.619
(Laughter)
（笑声）

212
00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:13.588
That takes some executive skills in logistics and communication.

213
00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:15.264
(Laughter)
（笑声）

214
00:10:15.288 --> 00:10:17.483
If that isn't "capable," I don't know what is.
如果那还不算“有能力的”， 我不知道什么才算了。

215
00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:24.257
(Applause)
（掌声）

216
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:28.068
I reckon, instead of judging fangirls, we can learn from them.
我觉得，与其对饭圈女孩评头论足， 我们可以从她们身上学到些什么。

217
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.568
We can all die tomorrow,
我们明天都可能会死。

218
00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:32.458
so why not love things while we're still breathing?

Alright, so here's what's going to happen.

00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:44.544
I'm going to count to three

to let out your very best fangirl scream.

Yeah?

230
00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:55.405
Here is why I am asking you to do this.
我之所以想让大家这么做，

231
00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:01.024
Because if all five-or-so thousand of you do this and really commit,

232
00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:04.913
we all get our first chance to hear that sound

Alright. OK, I am going to cheat and I'm not going to go full volume,
好，我得作弊 我不会发出我全部的音量，

239
00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:20.654

因为我带着麦克风， 我们都不会想听到那种声音的。
