below some of the hardest rock in the world.

Aboveground, it doesn't take long

9
00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:49.903
for the experts to figure out that there is no solution.
他们找不出可行的营救方案。

10

It's not exactly clear where the refuge is.

It's not even clear if the miners are alive.

And it's not even clear who's in charge.
甚至都不知道相关负责人是谁。

16
00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:18.374
Yet, within 70 days, all 33 of these men will be brought to the surface alive.

00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:25.837
So what's "teaming"?

20
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:28.068
Teaming is teamwork on the fly.

00:01:32.557 --> 00:01:37.241
expertise, distance, time zone, you name it --

24
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.005
to get work done.
来完成工作。

25
00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.604
Think of your favorite sports team, because this is different.
对比你最喜欢的运动队， 因为这是不一样的。

26
00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:47.613
Sports teams work together: that magic, those game-saving plays.
运动队需要协作：那种魔力， 那些扭转局势的操作。

27
00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:51.720
Now, sports teams win because they practice.
不过运动队会获胜， 是因为他们平时在练习。

28
00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:56.209
But you can only practice if you have the same members over time.
但你只能在有着同样队友的 情况下进行那样的练习。

29
00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.349
And so you can think of teaming ...
所以你可以想想团队合作……

30
00:01:58.373 --> 00:02:01.663
Sports teams embody the definition of a team,
运动队符合一个队伍的定义，

34
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.033
You can think of teaming as a kind of pickup game in the park,

35
00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:16.981
in contrast to the formal, well-practiced team.
而非专业的，训练充足的队伍。

36
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.533
Now, which one is going to win in a playoff?
那么，哪一队会在比赛中胜出呢？

37
00:02:19.557 --> 00:02:21.153
The answer is obvious.
答案显而易见。

38
00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:23.512
So why do I study teaming?
所以我为什么要研究团队合作呢？

39
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.792
It's because it's the way more and more of us have to work today.

42
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.591
and ever-narrower expertise,

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.845
more and more of us have to work with different people all the time

44
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.232
to get our work done.

45
00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:45.890
We don't have the luxury of stable teams.
我们无法奢望一个稳定的团队。

46
00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:50.044
Now, when you can have that luxury, by all means do it.

47
00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:52.812

we don't have that option.
却无法提供这样的条件。

49
00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:57.170
One place where this is true is hospitals.
比如，医院。

50
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:00.755
This is where I've done a lot of my research over the years.
多年来我的很多研究 都是在这里进行的。

51
00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.621
So it turns out hospitals have to be open 24/7.
医院必须24小时开放。

52
00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:09.784
And patients -- well, they're all different.

53
00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:12.565
They're all different in complicated and unique ways.

59
00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:33.119
But they have to coordinate in order for the patient to get great care.

60
00:03:33.143 --> 00:03:35.870
And when they don't, the results can be tragic.
而如果他们不这样做， 就会有惨剧发生。

61
00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:40.497
Of course, in teaming, the stakes aren't always life and death.
当然，在团队合作中， 并不总是涉及生死。

62
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:44.561
Consider what it takes to create an animated film,

79
00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:40.183
Now, this way of working isn't easy,

00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:43.759
but as I said, it's more and more the way many of us have to work,

if you don't know people very well.

而要想解释它，我想引用电影 《力争上游》里的一句话：

one of you won't be here next year."

218
00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:38.342
What message did they hear? "It's me or you."
他们听到了什么消息呢？ “不是我就是你。”

219
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.179
For me to succeed, you must fail.

221
00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:50.747
but still, many times people arrive with that message of scarcity anyway.
不过，许多时候，人们在进入组织时 依然会听到这条关于稀缺性的信息。

It's me or you.

223

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:59.115
So we have to overcome that one as well,
