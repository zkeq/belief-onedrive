And we had another couple who made books --

Am I a real parent?

At the start of treatment,

they still remember the advice they were given.

I don't know; that's quite different

from how we respond to children's questions.

We will say, "No, it comes from cows,"

and we will talk about the farmer,

but they acted really weird.

and it certainly was not what they had in mind,

190

nor what the counselor had in mind

when they were saying how important it is to be an open-communication family.

When we offer people pills, we gather evidence first.

It is not enough for advice,

or for professionals to give advice that is theoretically sound,

evidence that it actually improves patients' lives.

I will not end here with what went wrong;

209
00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:13.234
I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families.

210
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:17.381
Remember the books and the trip to the farmer?

215
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:36.097
is that what families need are warm relationships.

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:40.690
And we do not need to be professionals to create those.

although it may be hard work,

and from time to time, we can do with some advice.
