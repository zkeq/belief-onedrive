00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.820
bigger. And we are getting really destructive as

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.820
separate it, which only works at today's oil

have been burned and crushed under pressure.
这些植物曾被焚烧，再被高压压碎。

155

156
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.820
put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get

178
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820
As you think of what are the alternatives to this

we've got to start thinking of them as biological

185
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.820
energy, because if we keep treating them as

get a differential in gas output between one mine

really do start applying biological principles to

312
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.820
inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.820
amount of money and leaving most of the energy

314
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.820
down there. Which, of course, requires more energy

315
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.820
to go out and get energy. The ratios become

316
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.820
idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may

317
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.820
even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and
那样做，产出的能源与消耗的能源之比

318
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.820
the energy output. That is a stupid way of

319
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.820
managing this system.

320
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.820
Last point, last graph. One of the things that

321
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.820
we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This

322
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.820
is what oil prices look like, OK?

323
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.820
This is a very bad system because what happens is

324
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.820
your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.820
with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for
很好的太阳能板的设计，或者是利用

326
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.820
wind, or for something else, and then guess what?

327
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.820
The oil price goes through the floor. That company

328
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.820
goes out of business, and then you can bring the

330
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.820
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion,

let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the

332
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.820
United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put

333
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.820
a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it
油价上加一项税——非收入税，

334
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.820
basically says for the next 20 years, the price of
基本理念是说在最近的20年中，石油价格

335
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.820
oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40
将是——随便假设一个数字，35美元也好，

336
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.820
bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax
40美元也罢。如果欧佩克的油价低于这个价格，我们

337
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.820
it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax
就开征这项税。如果油价高于这个价格，这项税

338
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.820
goes away.
就取消。

339
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.820
What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it

340
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.820
do for companies? It tells people, if you can

341
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.820
produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or
低于35美元或40美元的价格生产能源，

343
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.820
a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a
我们可以竞争——你就能赢得生意。

344
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.820
business. But let's not put people through this

345
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.820
cycle where it doesn't pay to research because

346
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.820
your company will go out of business as OPEC
而破产，这就等于让欧佩克操纵了石油替代品的研发

347
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.820
drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from
使生物能源无法取得成功。

348

happening. Thank you.
谢谢。
