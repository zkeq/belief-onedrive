1
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.895
This is a tuberculosis ward,
这是一个肺结核病房，

2
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.736
and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s,
在十九世纪末

3
00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.376
one in seven of all people
每七个人中就有一个

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.160
died from tuberculosis.
死于肺结核。

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.360
We had no idea what was causing this disease.
我们不清楚这个病的起因。

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.016
The hypothesis was actually
我们猜想

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.296
it was your constitution that made you susceptible.
可能是我们的体质决定了我们的易感染性。

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.056
And it was a highly romanticized disease.
而且这种病被披上了浪漫滴外衣。

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.896
It was also called consumption,
被称为痨病。

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.056
and it was the disorder of poets
它是诗人，

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.816
and artists and intellectuals.
艺术家，智者得的病。

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.576
And some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity
有些人甚至认为这种病让你变得更敏感，

13
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.800
and conferred creative genius.
并且赋予你天才的特质。

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.656
By the 1950s,
到二十世纪五十年代，

15
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.256
we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused
我们发现肺结核是由

16
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.656
by a highly contagious bacterial infection,
一种传染性很强的细菌感染引起的，

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.856
which is slightly less romantic,
并没有那么浪漫，

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.136
but that had the upside
然而这

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.496
of us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it.
让我们想到研发药物来治疗这种疾病的可能性。

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.536
So doctors had discovered a new drug, iproniazid,
于是医生们发现了一种新药－异丙嗪，

21
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.936
that they were optimistic might cure tuberculosis,
他们乐观地认为可以治愈肺结核，

22
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.736
and they gave it to patients,
他们把这种药给病人服用，

23
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.536
and patients were elated.
病人们很兴奋。

24
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.056
They were more social, more energetic.
他们变得更活跃，充满生机。

25
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.680
One medical report actually says they were "dancing in the halls."
一项医学报告提到，他们“ 在走廊手舞足蹈。“

26
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.936
And unfortunately,
可惜的是

27
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.680
this was not necessarily because they were getting better.
这并不意味着他们在康复。

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.440
A lot of them were still dying.
很多病人依然频临死亡。

29
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.080
Another medical report describes them as being "inappropriately happy."
另外有一份医学报告称他们“不正常得开心”

30
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.640
And that is how the first antidepressant was discovered.
第一种抗抑郁药物就这样发明了。

31
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.856
So accidental discovery is not uncommon in science,
这种巧合在科学领域并不多见，

32
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.016
but it requires more than just a happy accident.
但是它需要的不仅仅是开心的巧合。

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.480
You have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur.
你需要有能力在这种巧合发生的时候抓住它。

34
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.056
As a neuroscientist, I'm going to talk to you a little bit
作为一个神经学家，让我与你分享一些

35
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.496
about my firsthand experience
我的第一手经验

36
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.736
with whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck --
你可能会称之为狗屎运，

37
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.376
let's call it smart luck.
我更倾向于称之为聪明的运气。

38
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.120
But first, a bit more background.
首先，说说背景知识。

39
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.936
Thankfully, since the 1950s,
自二十世纪五十年代，

40
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.936
we've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.
我们研发了其他药物，我们现在事实上已经可以治愈肺结核。

41
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.615
And at least in the United States, though not necessarily in other countries,
至少在美国是这样。

42
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.136
we have closed our sanitoriums
我们关闭了疗养院

43
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.840
and probably most of you are not too worried about TB.
而且可能你们大部分人已经不是那么担心肺结核。

44
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.376
But a lot of what was true in the early 1900s
可是在二十世纪初我们对于

45
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.256
about infectious disease,
传染病的担心，

46
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.920
we can say now about psychiatric disorders.
和当今的精神病类似。

47
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.656
We are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders
我们正陷于情绪困扰之中

48
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.440
like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
比如抑郁症和创后应激障碍，PTSD。

49
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.976
One in four of all adults in the United States
在美国，每四个人中就有一个

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.480
suffers from mental illness,
受精神疾病的困扰，

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.136
which means that if you haven't experienced it personally
也就是说即使你可能本身没有，

52
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.456
or someone in your family hasn't,
或者你的家人没有，

53
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.736
it's still very likely that someone you know has,
可是很有可能你认识的人有，

54
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.400
though they may not talk about it.
只是他们不说而已。

55
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.336
Depression has actually now surpassed
抑郁症实际上已经超越了

56
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.216
HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war
艾滋病，疟疾，糖尿病和战争

57
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.496
as the leading cause of disability worldwide.
成为全球范围健康的头号杀手。

58
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.136
And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,
就像二十世纪五十年代时的肺结核一样，

59
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.216
we don't know what causes it.
我们不清楚它的起因。

60
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.176
Once it's developed, it's chronic,
一旦发病，就是慢性

61
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.696
lasts a lifetime,
会伴随你一生，

62
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.040
and there are no known cures.
而且目前无法治愈。

63
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.696
The second antidepressant we discovered,
第二种抗抑郁药同样

64
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.176
also by accident, in the 1950s,
偶然发现于二十世纪五十年代，

65
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.400
from an antihistamine that was making people manic,
是从让人躁狂的抗组胺药中发现的，

66
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.880
imipramine.
丙咪嗪。

67
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.696
And in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine,
无论是在结核病还是抗组胺药的个案中，

68
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.416
someone had to be able to recognize
都需要有人发现

69
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.856
that a drug that was designed to do one thing --
一种本来用于治疗一种病的药物

70
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.456
treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies --
治疗结核或者抗过敏

71
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.216
could be used to do something very different --
都可以用于完全不同的治疗－

72
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.440
treat depression.
治疗抑郁症。

73
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.216
And this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging.
这种改变事实上非常具有挑战性。

74
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.176
When doctors first saw this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,
当医生们最早看到异丙嗪情绪提升的作用时，

75
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.656
they didn't really recognize what they saw.
他们并没有意识到他们看到的是什么。

76
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.536
They were so used to thinking about it
他们总是习惯性地从

77
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.336
from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug
治疗肺结核的药物

78
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.416
that they actually just listed it
的副作用

79
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.216
as a side effect, an adverse side effect.
不良的副作用来考虑。

80
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.391
As you can see here,
基于这个原因，

81
00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:17.440
a lot of these patients in 1954 are experiencing severe euphoria.
在1954 年许多病人表现出异常的快乐。

82
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.336
And they were worried that this might somehow interfere
于是医生们担心这种状态会影响病人

83
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.216
with their recovering from tuberculosis.
肺结核的治疗。

84
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.496
So they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme TB
于是他们建议异丙嗪只可以用于严重的结核病患者

85
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.200
and in patients that were highly emotionally stable,
以及心理状态非常稳定的病人，

86
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.936
which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant.
这显然和我们治疗抑郁病患者截然相反。

87
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.416
They were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease,
他们太过习惯于只关注一个病的状况，

88
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.360
they could not see the larger implications for another disease.
而未能从另一个疾病的角度看到药物更广的适用。

89
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.896
And to be fair, it's not entirely their fault.
公正地说，这不全是他们的错。

90
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.696
Functional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us.
我们可能都受着教条主义的影响，

91
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.176
It's a tendency to only be able to think of an object
我们倾向于只考虑一个事物

92
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.800
in terms of its traditional use or function.
传统意义上的使用和功能。

93
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.456
And mental set is another thing. Right?
而且思维方式是另一回事。 对吗？

94
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.496
That's sort of this preconceived framework
这种

95
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.296
with which we approach problems.
我们用于思考的思维定式

96
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.576
And that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us,
使得发散思考变得相当困难，

97
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.136
which is, I guess, why they gave a TV show to the guy who was,
也就是，我想，为什么电视节目亲赖于那些

98
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.960
like, really great at repurposing.
善于发散性思维的人们。

99
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.360
(Laughter)
（笑声）

100
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.336
So the effects in both the case of iproniazid and imipramine,
所以，在这两个例子中，异丙嗪和丙咪嗪

101
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.736
they were so strong --
药效都很强－

102
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.976
there was mania, or people dancing in the halls.
狂躁或是人们在走廊跳舞。

103
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.136
It's actually not that surprising they were caught.
他们被注意到并不奇怪。

104
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.640
But it does make you wonder what else we've missed.
那么你会否想到我们是否还忽视了其他东西。

105
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.016
So iproniazid and imipramine,
所以异丙嗪和丙咪嗪

106
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.456
they're more than just a case study in repurposing.
他们不仅仅是发散思维的一个案例，

107
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.456
They have two other things in common that are really important.
他们有其他两样重要的共性，

108
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.976
One, they have terrible side effects.
其一， 他们有很强的副作用

109
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.616
That includes liver toxicity,
包括肝中毒，

110
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.616
weight gain of over 50 pounds,
体重增加超过50 磅，

111
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.416
suicidality.
自杀倾向。

112
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.616
And two, they both increase levels of serotonin,
第二， 他们都增加了血清素的指标

113
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.976
which is a chemical signal in the brain,
大脑中的一个化学信号，

114
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.200
or a neurotransmitter.
或者神经传递组织。

115
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.696
And those two things together, right, one or the two,
这两个副作用一起，对，第一个或者第二个

116
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.336
may not have been that important,
可能不是那么重要，

117
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.096
but the two together meant that we had to develop safer drugs,
但是两者合并意味着我们必须开发更安全的药物

118
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.640
and that serotonin seemed like a pretty good place to start.
而且血清素似乎是个好的突破口。

119
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.376
So we developed drugs to more specifically focus on serotonin,
于是我们研制了专注于血清素的药物，

120
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.056
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,
选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂， SSRIs，

121
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.816
the most famous of which is Prozac.
最有名的就是Prozac。

122
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.816
And that was 30 years ago,
那是30 年前，

123
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.040
and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs.
从那时起我们致力于优化这些药物。

124
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.776
And the SSRIs, they are better than the drugs that came before them,
SSRI类药物比以前的药物都好，

125
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.896
but they still have a lot of side effects,
但是他们也还有副作用，

126
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.816
including weight gain, insomnia,
包括体重增加，失眠，

127
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.040
suicidality --
自杀倾向－

128
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.256
and they take a really long time to work,
而且药效产生慢，

129
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.816
something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients.
有些患者需要4到6个星期才见效。

130
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.016
And that's in the patients where they do work.
这是在那些药物产生疗效的患者中。

131
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.896
There are a lot of patients where these drugs don't work.
也有许多患者对药物没有反应。

132
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.296
And that means now, in 2016,
也就是说，现在，在2016年，

133
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.136
we still have no cures for any mood disorders,
我们依然没有治愈情绪障碍的药物，

134
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.216
just drugs that suppress symptoms,
只有抑制症状的药物，

135
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.296
which is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection
就好像治疗感染的时候，止痛药和

136
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.736
versus an antibiotic.
抗菌素的区别。

137
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.616
A painkiller will make you feel better,
止痛药让你感觉好些，

138
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.720
but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease.
但不能治愈引起痛症的病。

139
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.856
And it was this flexibility in our thinking
是我们思维的灵活性

140
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.816
that let us recognize that iproniazid and imipramine
让我们发现 了异丙嗪和丙咪嗪

141
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.936
could be repurposed in this way,
可以用作其他用途，

142
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.936
which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,
引领我们走向血清素，

143
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.960
which we then, ironically, fixated on.
然后我们专注于

144
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.336
This is brain signaling, serotonin,
大脑的信号，血清素

145
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.616
from an SSRI commercial.
一种SSRI药物

146
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.000
In case you're not clear, this is a dramatization.
如果你不清楚的话，这是图示。

147
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.536
And in science, we try and remove our bias, right,
在科学领域，我们尽可能排除偏见，是吧？

148
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.936
by running double-blinded experiments
通过双盲试验

149
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.656
or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be.
或者对我们的试验数据持中立的态度。

150
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.976
But bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study
但是偏见却悄悄地渗入到我们研究的课题

151
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.720
and how we choose to study it.
以及我们选择的研究方法。

152
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.656
So we've focused on serotonin now for the past 30 years,
所以在过去30年我们潜心于血清素的同时，

153
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.920
often to the exclusion of other things.
也排除了其他的事物。

154
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.040
We still have no cures,
我们依然没有根治的方法。

155
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.416
and what if serotonin isn't all there is to depression?
假如血清素不是抑郁的全部？

156
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.496
What if it's not even the key part of it?
或者如果它根本不是抑郁的核心？

157
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.696
That means no matter how much time
那就意味着无论我们花多少时间

158
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.456
or money or effort we put into it,
或是金钱，或是努力，

159
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.400
it will never lead to a cure.
我们永远找不到治愈的办法。

160
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.896
In the past few years, doctors have discovered
在过去的几年，医生们发现了

161
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.840
probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the SSRIs,
自从SSRI以来的第一种新抗抑郁药

162
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.656
Calypsol,
Calypsol

163
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.136
and this drug works very quickly, within a few hours or a day,
而且这种药见效快，只需几个小时或者一天。

164
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.056
and it doesn't work on serotonin.
而且它不影响血清素。

165
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.760
It works on glutamate, which is another neurotransmitter.
它作用于谷氨酸，另一种神经传感器。

166
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.696
And it's also repurposed.
这也是一个重新定位的例子。

167
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.800
It was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery.
这种药传统上是用于手术中的麻醉剂。

168
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.016
But unlike those other drugs,
不像其他的药物，

169
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.856
which were recognized pretty quickly,
很快就得到认同，

170
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.576
it took us 20 years
人们用了20 年

171
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.256
to realize that Calypsol was an antidepressant,
才意识到 Calypsol 是一种抗抑郁药物。

172
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.136
despite the fact that it's actually a better antidepressant,
尽管事实上

173
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.776
probably, than those other drugs.
它可能比其他的药物都更有效。

174
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.896
It's actually probably because of the fact that it's a better antidepressant
事实上有可能正因为它是一种更有效的抗抑郁药

175
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.815
that it was harder for us to recognize.
所以才更难以被大家认识。

176
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.920
There was no mania to signal its effects.
没有狂躁来凸显它的副作用。

177
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.496
So in 2013, up at Columbia University,
所以在2013年， 在哥伦比亚大学，

178
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.096
I was working with my colleague,
我在和我的同事

179
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.096
Dr. Christine Ann Denny,
Christine Ann Denny 博士工作

180
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.920
and we were studying Calypsol as an antidepressant in mice.
我们在研究Calypsol作为抗抑郁药物在老鼠身上的反应。

181
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.296
And Calypsol has, like, a really short half-life,
Calypsol的半衰期很短，

182
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.376
which means it's out of your body within a few hours.
就是说它在几小时内就会被排出体外。

183
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.816
And we were just piloting.
我们只是在试验，

184
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.096
So we would give an injection to mice,
所以我们会给老鼠注射

185
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.416
and then we'd wait a week,
我们然后等一个星期，

186
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.120
and then we'd run another experiment to save money.
然后我们为了省钱会再进行另一个试验。

187
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.976
And one of the experiments I was running,
在我的一个试验中，

188
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.656
we would stress the mice,
我们会给老鼠们施加压力，

189
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.896
and we used that as a model of depression.
我们把这当作一个抑郁样本。

190
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.256
And at first it kind of just looked like it didn't really work at all.
起初看起来好像根本没什么作用

191
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.800
So we could have stopped there.
所以我们本应该停止。

192
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.256
But I have run this model of depression for years,
但是我做这个抑郁试验多年，

193
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.176
and the data just looked kind of weird.
收集到的数据有些怪。

194
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.056
It didn't really look right to me.
反正就是看起来不对。

195
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.296
So I went back,
于是我回去，

196
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.816
and we reanalyzed it
重新分析

197
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.656
based on whether or not they had gotten that one injection of Calypsol
根据它们是否被注射 Calypsol

198
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.880
a week beforehand.
一星期前

199
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.776
And it looked kind of like this.
数据是这样的

200
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.936
So if you look at the far left,
如果你看最左边，

201
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.456
if you put a mouse in a new space,
如果你把一只老鼠放在一个新环境

202
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.736
this is the box, it's very exciting,
这是那个盒子，它很兴奋，

203
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.896
a mouse will walk around and explore,
老鼠会到处走来走去。

204
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.216
and you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking.
你看到的粉色线时它们走动的记录

205
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.416
And we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup
我们还给它提供了另外一只装在笔盒里的老鼠

206
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.496
that it can decide to interact with.
如果它愿意，可以和它交流。

207
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.736
This is also a dramatization, in case that's not clear.
这也是一个图示，让大家看得更清楚。

208
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.456
And a normal mouse will explore.
一个正常的老鼠会探索。

209
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.720
It will be social.
会社交。

210
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.816
Check out what's going on.
查看周围在发生什么。

211
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.736
If you stress a mouse in this depression model,
如果你给老鼠压力，让它抑郁，

212
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.040
which is the middle box,
像中间的这个盒子，

213
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.816
they aren't social, they don't explore.
它们不会社交，不会探索，

214
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.120
They mostly just kind of hide in that back corner, behind a cup.
多数时间它们会躲在杯子后面角落。

215
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.936
Yet the mice that had gotten that one injection of Calypsol,
然而那些注射了一针Calypsol的老鼠

216
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.160
here on your right,
在右边

217
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.840
they were exploring, they were social.
它们在探索，在交流。

218
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.040
They looked like they had never been stressed at all,
它们看上去似乎从未被抑郁

219
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.040
which is impossible.
不可思议。

220
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.800
So we could have just stopped there,
我们本可以就此打住，

221
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.896
but Christine had also used Calypsol before as anesthesia,
但是Christine曾经使用过Calypsol 做为麻醉药物，

222
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.496
and a few years ago she had seen
几年前她曾经看到

223
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.896
that it seemed to have some weird effects on cells
它似乎对细胞有些奇怪的作用

224
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.136
and some other behavior
而且一些其他行为

225
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.176
that also seemed to last long after the drug,
似乎在用药之后持续很久，

226
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.456
maybe a few weeks.
可能有几个星期。

227
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.736
So we were like, OK,
于是我们觉得，好的，

228
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.936
maybe this is not completely impossible,
也许这不是完全不可能。

229
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.456
but we were really skeptical.
但是我们也充满疑惑。

230
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.016
So we did what you do in science when you're not sure,
于是我们做了在科学上当你疑惑的时候该做的事，

231
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.240
and we ran it again.
再次试验。

232
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.296
And I remember being in the animal room,
我记得在动物房

233
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.976
moving mice from box to box to test them,
把老鼠从一个盒子放到另一个盒子来试验它们，

234
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.616
and Christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap
Christine 就坐在地上， 腿上放着她的手提电脑，

235
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.056
so the mice couldn't see her,
这样老鼠就看不到她。

236
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.336
and she was analyzing the data in real time.
她在做实地数据分析。

237
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.736
And I remember us yelling,
我记得我们大叫，

238
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.056
which you're not supposed to do in an animal room where you're testing,
（当然不应该在做测试的动物房这样做）

239
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.656
because it had worked.
因为我们成功了。

240
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.056
It seemed like these mice were protected against stress,
似乎这些老鼠受到了能够对抗压力的保护，

241
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.136
or they were inappropriately happy, however you want to call it.
或者说他们不适当地快乐，你怎么形容都好。

242
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.600
And we were really excited.
我们非常激动。

243
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.120
And then we were really skeptical, because it was too good to be true.
然后我们变得很疑惑因为这个结果好得令人难以置信。

244
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.880
So we ran it again.
于是我们又做了一次试验。

245
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.296
And then we ran it again in a PTSD model,
我们又做了一次，不过是用 PTSD 模式

246
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.736
and we ran it again in a physiological model,
然后我们又做了一次心理试验模式

247
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.976
where all we did was give stress hormones.
我们给他们压力荷尔蒙

248
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.616
And we had our undergrads run it.
我们让本科生做的实验

249
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.760
And then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in France run it.
然后我们让在法国的合作者实验

250
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.816
And every time someone ran it, they confirmed the same thing.
每一次的试验都验证了同样的结果。

251
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.656
It seemed like this one injection of Calypsol
似乎一剂 Calypsol 的注射

252
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.440
was somehow protecting against stress for weeks.
可以防止压力过量几个星期。

253
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.856
And we only published this a year ago,
一年前我们发表了这个，

254
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.960
but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect.
从那时起其他的实验室独立验证了这项效果

255
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.680
So we don't know what causes depression,
所以我们不知道抑郁的本源，

256
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.976
but we do know that stress is the initial trigger
但是我们知道压力是诱因

257
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.336
in 80 percent of cases,
百分之八十的个案中，

258
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.576
and depression and PTSD are different diseases,
抑郁和创伤后应激障碍是不同的疾病，

259
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.616
but this is something they share in common.
但是他们有共性

260
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.456
Right? It is traumatic stress
对吧？那就是强大的压力

261
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.376
like active combat or natural disasters
就像剧烈的战斗或者自然灾害

262
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.856
or community violence or sexual assault
或者社区暴力，性侵

263
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.160
that causes post-traumatic stress disorder,
都会引起创伤后应激障碍，

264
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.416
and not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder.
但是不是每个经历过刺激的人都会产生情绪障碍。

265
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.336
And this ability to experience stress and be resilient
这种经历创伤但能恢复

266
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.520
and bounce back and not develop depression or PTSD
而且不形成抑郁或创伤后应激障碍

267
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.576
is known as stress resilience,
就是我们说的抗压恢复能力。

268
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.456
and it varies between people.
这种能力每个人都不一样。

269
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.816
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property.
我们一直以为它是一种负面因素

270
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.376
It's the absence of susceptibility factors
是缺乏敏感因素

271
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.480
and risk factors for these disorders.
以及这些心理障碍的风险因素

272
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.320
But what if it were active?
但是如果它是活性的，

273
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.736
Maybe we could enhance it,
也许我们可以加强它

274
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.920
sort of akin to putting on armor.
好像给它戴上盔甲。

275
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.640
We had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug.
我们碰巧发现了第一种提高抗压力的药物。

276
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.336
And like I said, we only gave a tiny amount of the drug,
像我说的那样，我们只给了很小剂量的药物，

277
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.936
and it lasted for weeks,
药效持续了几个星期，

278
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.176
and that's not like anything you see with antidepressants.
这不是你所了解的抗抑郁药物。

279
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.520
But it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines.
但是它却像是接种疫苗

280
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.936
So in immune vaccines, you'll get your shots,
如果你接种了疫苗，

281
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.336
and then weeks, months, years later,
那么几周，几个月，几年后，

282
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.696
when you're actually exposed to bacteria,
当你接触细菌的时候

283
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.176
it's not the vaccine in your body that protects you.
不是你身体里的疫苗在保护你，

284
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.576
It's your own immune system
是你自身的免疫系统

285
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.736
that's developed resistance and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off,
已经产生了对这种细菌的抗体在对抗细菌

286
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.896
and you actually never get the infection,
而你从未真正被感染过。

287
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.976
which is very different from, say, our treatments. Right?
这和我们的治疗不同，是吧？

288
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.816
In that case, you get the infection, you're exposed to the bacteria,
在那种情况下，你接种，接触细菌，

289
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.696
you're sick, and then you take, say, an antibiotic which cures it,

290
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.960
and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria.

291
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.096
Or similar to as I said before, with this palliative,
或者像我以前所说的，使用这种姑息治疗，

292
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.976
you'll take something that will suppress the symptoms,
你服用药物掩盖病症，

293
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.696
but it won't treat the underlying infection,
而不能治愈引起病痛的源头

294
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.056
and you'll only feel better during the time in which you're taking it,
在你用药的时候你觉得好些，

295
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.016
which is why you have to keep taking it.

296
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.736
And in depression and PTSD --

297
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.736
here we have your stress exposure --

298
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.376
we only have palliative care.
我们只能保守治疗，

299
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.896
Antidepressants only suppress symptoms,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.776
and that is why you basically have to keep taking them

301
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.496
for the life of the disease,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.720
which is often the length of your own life.

303
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.976
So we're calling our resilience-enhancing drugs "paravaccines,"

304
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.536
which means vaccine-like,

Also, not all antidepressants are also paravaccines.

310
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.736
We tried Prozac as well,

and that had no effect.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.496
we might be able to protect people

322

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.656
that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise

up to six trillion dollars in just the next 15 years.

It's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations,

337
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.960
If we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.496
it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,

339
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.376
but as is, we have to compete with our functional fixedness

they have to go through the entire FDA approval process --

if they make it before they can ever be used in humans.
