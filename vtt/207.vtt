I would actually argue that we're already augmented.
我想说的是 其实我们已经被强化了

27
00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:43.612
Imagine you're at a party,

Even Siri is just a passive tool.

the tools that we've had have been completely passive.

38
00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:26.009
In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,

we've always been limited

40
00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:31.006
by this need to manually push our wills into our tools --
手动地将我们的意愿推动到 我们的工具中的需要所限制

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.071
like, manual, literally using our hands,

42
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:34.779
even with computers.
甚至是在使用电脑的时候

44
00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.229
(Laughter)

That conversation might be a little ways off,

00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:59.023
probably less than many of us think,

In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

66
00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:36.142
Then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space:

70
00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.537

77
00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:05.114
(Laughter)
（观众笑声）

78
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.162
It's because the algorithms are designed to work

to come up with this.

88
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.430

89
00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.600
and it will be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.
而且它将于今年在A320 空中客机中飞翔

90
00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:40.784
So computers can now generate;

they can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.

92
00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:47.807
But they're not intuitive.

93
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.917
They still have to start from scratch every single time,

94
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.506
and that's because they never learn.

164
00:08:05.772 --> 00:08:09.865
I think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world

165
00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.954
as it is about the virtual, intellectual realm.

174
00:08:36.012 --> 00:08:38.374
This is our applied research lab in San Francisco,

175
00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:41.540
where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics,

178
00:08:47.637 --> 00:08:49.426
As an experiment, we set it up

214
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:34.696
and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel,

215
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.003
and then they're going to keep printing, without human intervention,

216
00:10:38.027 --> 00:10:39.585
until the bridge is finished.
