50
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.088
He got back to me two weeks later with this list:

It was all members of my super fund.

接着我意识到不仅只有我的超级基金， 几乎所有养老基金都是。

it was banks, insurers and fund managers.

00:03:43.048 --> 00:03:45.921
And then I realized it wasn't just Australia.

64
00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:48.857
It was the entire global finance sector,

completely tangled up with the tobacco industry.

The industry that makes products that kill seven million people every year.

67
00:03:57.295 --> 00:04:00.462
So I started discussing the issue with my superannuation fund,

and I've been discussing it ever since.

69
00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:06.683
Finance leaders have many challenging issues to deal with, these days.

70
00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:09.508
So I suggest they adopt a framework

71
00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:12.651
that clearly articulates why it is reasonable

74
00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:23.826
of any company in which they might invest our money.
先问三个问题。

75
00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:25.809
Question one:
问题1：

76
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:30.450
Can the product made by the company be used safely?

"No" is the answer for tobacco companies.

Zero is the only safe number of cigarettes for a human being.

79
00:04:37.326 --> 00:04:39.492
It could not be more black and white.
再没有比这个答案更黑白分明的了。

80
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:41.635
Question two:
问题2：

81
00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.707
Is the problem caused by the company so significant on a global level

82
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:49.997
that it is subject to a UN treaty or convention?

83
00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:52.913
"Yes" is the answer for tobacco.

00:04:52.937 --> 00:04:55.921
Indeed there is a UN tobacco treaty

85
00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:59.371
that has been ratified by 180 countries.

86
00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:01.742
The treaty was created
条约之所以确立

87
00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:05.433
because of the catastrophic global impact of tobacco.

88
00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:10.056
The current forecast is that the world is on track

for one billion tobacco-related deaths this century.

91
00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:19.018
There's only seven billion of us.

92
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:23.788
Question three relates to the concept of engagement.
第三个问题，涉及到参与的概念。

93
00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:27.992
Many financial organizations genuinely want to be good corporate citizens.

94
00:05:28.397 --> 00:05:31.143
They want to use their shareholder power

95
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.477
to sit down with companies, engage with them,

and encourage them to do better things.

97
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:37.207
So the question is:
所以问题在于：

Can engagement with the company be an effective lever for change?
与公司的接触 是否是改变的有效手段？

99
00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:45.647
"No" is the answer for tobacco companies.

100
00:05:45.973 --> 00:05:48.594
Engagement with the tobacco industry is futile.
与烟草业的接触是徒劳的。

101
00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:50.755
The only acceptable outcome would be

102
00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.113
if tobacco companies ceased their primary business.
烟草公司停止他们的主营业务。

103
00:05:54.532 --> 00:05:57.212
In fact, engagement with the tobacco industry

104
00:05:57.236 --> 00:06:01.056
has never led to less human death.
从来没有降低死亡数字。

105
00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:05.484
When we consider that framework, three simple questions,
如果我们考虑这个框架， 三个简单的问题，

106
00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:08.913
we can see that is reasonable and defensible

107
00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:14.113
to take a strong position and exclude investment in the tobacco industry.
排除对烟草业的投资 是合理的，站得住脚的。

108
00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:17.848
In addition to the UN tobacco treaty,
事实上，除了联合国烟草公约，

109
00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:22.194
there is, in fact, another global treaty that demands that we act on tobacco.
还有另一项全球条约 要求我们对烟草采取行动。

110
00:06:22.792 --> 00:06:27.564
In 2015, the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals.
2015年，联合国通过了 《可持续发展目标》。

111
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.524
Now, we're talking about tobacco,
现在，谈到烟草业，

112
00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:32.287
and I know you're going to jump straight to number three:

113
00:06:30.827 --> 00:06:32.071
good health and well-being.

114
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:35.054
And indeed, ramping up tobacco control regulation

00:06:35.988 --> 00:06:38.339
is essential if we're going to achieve that goal.
对于实现这个目标很关键。

116
00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.699
However, look a bit more deeply,

117
00:06:40.723 --> 00:06:45.754
and you will find that 13 of the 17 goals cannot be achieved
你会发现第13和第17个 目标也无法实现，

118
00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:49.374
unless there is a major shake-up of the tobacco industry.
除非烟草行业发生了重大的变革。

119
00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:53.132
Personally, my favorite goal is number 17:

120
00:06:53.156 --> 00:06:54.956
partnerships for the goals.

121
00:06:55.298 --> 00:07:00.980
At present, we have the entire global health sector doing everything it can

122
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.897
to help the tidal wave of patients suffering as a result of tobacco.
帮助受烟草影响的患者。

123
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.572
But that said, in the past year alone, seven million people have died,
话虽如此，在过去一年， 700万的人还是因此失去了生命。

124
00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:10.532
so clearly, that is not enough.
所以很明显，这还不够。

125
00:07:11.143 --> 00:07:14.707
We also have governments aligned on tobacco, 180 of them,
各国政府也对烟草业采取了 共同行动，有180个国家参与其中，

126
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:18.730
busily trying to implement the provisions of the UN tobacco treaty.
忙着执行联合国烟草条约的规定。

127
00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:21.198
But that, too, is not enough.
但那也远远不够。

128
00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:28.159
If the global finance sector continues to lend money to tobacco companies,

129
00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:30.540
to invest in tobacco companies,

130
00:07:30.564 --> 00:07:33.556
and to strive to profit from tobacco companies,

131
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.847
we are working against each other.

00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:38.619
Now, if we are going to disrupt

00:07:38.643 --> 00:07:42.342
what doctors call "the global tobacco epidemic,"

134
00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:46.484
we need every sector of society to stand side by side

135
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.375
and be part of the solution.
成为解决问题的一部分。

136
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:51.451
So I call on finance leaders

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:55.205
to implement a framework to deal with sensitive issues.

And I call on them to uphold global conventions.

139
00:07:59.127 --> 00:08:01.818
But in addition, there are business risks.

140
00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:06.540
Pure financial risks, associated with being invested in the tobacco industry

141
00:08:06.564 --> 00:08:07.976
over the long term,
