staring at the door.

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:20.618
from the hospital.
从医院回来。

5
00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:24.349
She was there because my grandmother had cancer surgery that day.

6
00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:28.341
Finally, the doors opened,

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:44.013
Your grandmother's dying wish was to be buried back home in Korea."
你们外婆的遗愿 是要葬回韩国老家。”

13
00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:49.822
I was barely 12 years old, and when the shock wore off,
我当时也就12岁吧， 当震惊慢慢退去，

14
00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:53.155
my mother's words were ringing in my ears.

My grandmother wanted to be buried back home.

16
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.186
We had moved from Korea to Argentina six years prior,
外婆去世的6年前， 我们从韩国搬到阿根廷，

17
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.801
without knowing any Spanish, or how we were going to make a living.
完全不懂西班牙语， 也不知道要如何生存。

18
00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:13.102
And upon arrival, we were immigrants who had lost everything,
抵达的时候， 我们是身无分文的移民，

19
00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:16.627
so we had to work really hard to rebuild our lives.
因此必须要非常努力地 工作来开始新生活。

20
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.275
So it hadn't occurred to me that after all these years,
这么多年过去了，我从未想过，

21
00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.242
back home was still in Korea.
韩国才是我的家乡。

22
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:28.469
It made me ponder where I would want to be buried someday,
我开始琢磨，将来我想被葬在哪里，

23
00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:30.388
where home was for me,

24
00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:32.979
and the answer was not obvious.
但我却找不到答案。

25
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.322
And this really bothered me.
这件事令我很困扰。

26
00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:41.975
So this episode launched a lifelong quest for my identity.
这件事开启了我一生中 寻找自己的身份的旅程。

27
00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:46.566
I was born in Korea -- the land of kimchi;
我在泡菜之国——韩国出生；

28
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.424
raised in Argentina,
在阿根廷长大，

29
00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:54.115
where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now;
可能因为吃太多牛排， 我觉得现在我80%的成分是牛；

30
00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.257
and I was educated in the US,
然后我在美国接受教育，

31
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.603
where I became addicted to peanut butter.
在这儿又对花生酱爱得无法自拔。

32
00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:00.206
(Laughter)
（笑声）

33
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.164
During my childhood, I felt very much Argentinian,
小时候，我觉得自己 是个地道的阿根廷人，

34
00:02:04.188 --> 00:02:06.848
but my looks betrayed me at times.
但我的外表时不时会背叛我。

35
00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:10.142
I remember on the first day of middle school,
我还记得上中学的第一天，

36
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.874
my Spanish literature teacher came into the room.
我的西班牙文学老师走进教室。

37
00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.885
She scanned all of my classmates,
她扫了一眼全班同学，

38
00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.084
and she said,
说到，

39
00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.657
"You -- you have to get a tutor,
“你，你要请一个家教，

40
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:21.540
otherwise, you won't pass this class."
否则，你肯定过不了这门课。”

41
00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:25.426
But by then I was fluent in Spanish already,
但当时我的西班牙语 已经非常流利了，

42
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.462
so it felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian,
当时给我的感觉就是， 我要么是韩国人，要么是阿根廷人，

43
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.492
but not both.
但不可能两者都是。

44
00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:35.059
It felt like a zero-sum game,
这种感觉就像是非此即彼的博弈，

45
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:38.020
where I had to give up my old identity
我必须放弃自己的旧身份，

46
00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:41.604
to be able to gain or earn a new one.
才能获得新身份。

47
00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:47.204
So when I was 18, I decided to go to Korea,
18岁那年，我决定去韩国，

48
00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:51.282
hoping that finally I could find a place to call home.
希望找到一个能称之为家的地方。

49
00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.303
But there people asked me,
但有人问我，

50
00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:56.723
"Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish accent?"
“为什么你说韩语有西班牙口音？”

51
00:02:56.747 --> 00:02:57.771
(Laughter)
（笑声）

52
00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:01.290
And, "You must be Japanese because of your big eyes
“你肯定是日本人，因为你眼睛很大，

53
00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.324
and your foreign body language."
肢体动作也像外国人。”

54
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:08.744
And so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian,
原来，作为阿根廷人， 我太韩国范儿，

55
00:03:08.768 --> 00:03:10.898
but too Argentinian to be Korean.
作为韩国人，我又太阿根廷范儿。

56
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.057
And this was a pivotal realization to me.
对我来说这是一个非常关键的认识。

57
00:03:15.668 --> 00:03:20.417
I had failed to find that place in the world to call home.
我找不到一个可以称作老家的地方。

58
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:25.961
But how many Japanese-looking Koreans who speak with a Spanish accent --
但是看起来像日本人的韩国人， 讲话又带着西班牙口音，

59
00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:28.984
or even more specific, Argentinian accent --
或者更确切地说，带着阿根廷口音，

60
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.665
do you think are out there?
这样的人你们觉得有多少呢？

61
00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.074
Perhaps this could be an advantage.
也许这是一个优势。

62
00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:36.699
It was easy for me to stand out,
我更容易在人群中凸显出来，

63
00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:40.051
which couldn't hurt in a world that was rapidly changing,
在这个变化迅速的世界，

64
00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:43.122
where skills could become obsolete overnight.
你的技能也许一夜之间就被淘汰了。

65
00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:49.886
So I stopped looking for that 100 percent commonality
因此我不再在遇到的人身上，

66
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.406
with the people that I met.
寻找100%的共性。

67
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.867
Instead, I realized that oftentimes, I was the only overlap
取而代之的是，我常常意识到， 自己正好处于交叉地带，

68
00:03:57.891 --> 00:04:01.903
between groups of people that were usually in conflict with each other.
位于常常有冲突发生的人群中间。

69
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.868
So with this realization in mind,
带着这种认识，

70
00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:10.085
I decided to embrace all of the different versions of myself --
我决定接受一个截然不同的自己，

71
00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.600
even allow myself to reinvent myself at times.
甚至允许自己以全新的面貌出现。

72
00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:18.486
So for example, in high school,
比如，在高中的时候，

73
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.520
I have to confess I was a mega-nerd.
我不得不承认我是个书呆子。

74
00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:24.147
I had no sense of fashion -- thick glasses, simple hairstyle --
对于时尚一窍不通—— 戴着厚眼镜，留着简单的发型，

75
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:25.516
you can get the idea.
相信你们能想象出来。

76
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.833
I think, actually, I only had friends because I shared my homework.
我觉得，那时候我之所以有朋友， 是因为我借作业给他们抄。

77
00:04:29.857 --> 00:04:31.007
That's the truth.
是真的。

78
00:04:31.447 --> 00:04:33.479
But once at university,
但在大学的时候，

79
00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:37.197
I was able to find a new identity for myself,
我找到了自己新的身份，

80
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:41.191
and the nerd became a popular girl.
从书呆子变成了受欢迎的女孩。

81
00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:43.042
But it was MIT,
但因为我在麻省理工，

82
00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:45.721
so I don't know if I can take too much credit for that.
所以我也不知道 这种改变到底有多大用处。

83
00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:47.350
As they say over there,
他们那儿有句话，

84
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.701
"The odds are good,
“数量挺多的，

85
00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:52.202
but the goods are odd."
质量却不好。”

86
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.168
(Laughter)
（笑声）

87
00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:58.653
I switched majors so many times that my advisors joked

88
00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:01.536
that I should get a degree in "random studies."

89
00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:03.340
(Laughter)
（笑声）

90
00:05:03.743 --> 00:05:05.023
I told this to my kids.
我把这件事告诉了我的孩子们。

91
00:05:05.047 --> 00:05:09.622
And then over the years, I have gained a lot of different identities.

92
00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:14.222
I started as an inventor, entrepreneur, social innovator.

And most recently, I became a mom,

00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:26.443
or as my toddler says repeatedly,

98
00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:29.469
"Mom!" day and night.
“妈～妈～”，从早到晚。

99
00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:35.535
Even my accent was so confused --
就连我的口音也很奇怪——

100
00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:38.011
its origin was so obscure,
它是如此复杂，

101
00:05:38.035 --> 00:05:40.985
that my friends called it, "Rebecanese."
以至于我的朋友管它叫“瑞贝卡语”。

102
00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:42.485
(Laughter)
（笑声）

103
00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:45.982
But reinventing yourself can be very hard.

104
00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:49.187
You can face a lot of resistance at times.

When I was nearly done with my PhD,

I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug.

107

I was in Silicon Valley,

00:05:57.014 --> 00:06:02.351
and so writing a thesis in the basement didn't seem as interesting

109
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:04.248
as starting my own company.
跟自己开公司没法比。

110
00:06:04.272 --> 00:06:07.446
So I went to my very traditional Korean parents,

115
00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:22.243
so for a family of immigrants, this was kind of a big deal.

You can imagine how this conversation was going to go.

I must tell you -- this chart was definitely skewed
