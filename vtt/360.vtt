00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.352
Here's a question we should all be asking:

2
00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:17.145
What went wrong?
“什么地方出错了？”

3
00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.027
Not just with the pandemic

4
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.051
but with our civic life.
还有我们的公民生活。

5
00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:26.046
What brought us to this polarized, rancorous political moment?
是什么使我们陷入了两极分化，满怀恶意的政治时代？

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:28.421
In recent decades,

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:36.953
setting us apart.
分化着我们。

10
00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:40.862
This divide is partly about inequality.
这种鸿沟一部分是关于不平等的，

11
00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:46.044
But it's also about the attitudes toward winning and losing
但是也与随之而来的

12
00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:47.655
that have come with it.
对输赢的态度有关。

13
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.330
Those who landed on top

00:00:56.342 --> 00:01:00.770
and that those who lost out had no one to blame but themselves.

17
00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:04.378
This way of thinking about success
这种对成功的思考方式

18
00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:07.820
arises from a seemingly attractive principle.
来自于一种看似很有吸引力的原则。

19
00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.000
If everyone has an equal chance,
如果每个人都有平等的机会，

20
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:14.000
the winners deserve their winnings.
那胜利者就应该得到奖赏。

21
00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:18.563
This is the heart of the meritocratic ideal.
这就是精英理想的核心。

22
00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:23.151
In practice, of course, we fall far short.
当然，在实践中，情况远远不是这样。

23
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:27.806
Not everybody has an equal chance to rise.

Children born to poor families tend to stay poor when they grow up.

富裕的家长能够把自己的优势转移给他们的孩子。

26
00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:43.427
At Ivy League universities, for example,

27
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:46.851
there are more students from the top one percent
来自最顶尖 1% 家庭的学生数量

28
00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:51.756
than from the entire bottom half of the country combined.

29
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:57.467
But the problem isn't only that we fail to live up

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:00.403
to the meritocratic principles we proclaim.
我们宣称的精英原则，

31
00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:04.278
The ideal itself is flawed.

32
00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:06.246
It has a dark side.
它有它黑暗的一面。

33
00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:10.778
Meritocracy is corrosive of the common good.
精英政治侵蚀着共同利益。

34
00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.164
It leads to hubris among the winners
它导致了胜利者的傲慢，

35
00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:19.028
and humiliation among those who lose out.
和失败者的屈辱。

36
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.463
It encourages the successful to inhale too deeply of their success,
它也鼓励了成功者深深沉迷于自己的成功，

37
00:02:25.487 --> 00:02:30.362
to forget the luck and good fortune that helped them on their way.
以至于忘掉了一路上帮助到他们的好运气。

38
00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:35.203
And it leads them to look down on those less fortunate,

39
00:02:35.227 --> 00:02:37.996
less credentialed than themselves.

40
00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:41.389
This matters for politics.
这对政治领域来说非常重要。

41
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.270
One of the most potent sources of the populous backlash
造成民众强烈反对的最有力原因之一，

42
00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:52.627
is the sense among many working people that elites look down on them.
是许多工薪阶层感到精英们瞧不起他们。

43
00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:55.528
It's a legitimate complaint.
这是一种合理的投诉。

44
00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:03.104
Even as globalization brought deepening inequality and stagnant wages,
即使全球化带来了不平等加剧和工资增长的停滞，

45
00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:09.099
its proponents offered workers some bracing advice.
它的支持者也为工人们提供了一些有益的建议。

46
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:15.131
"If you want to compete and win in the global economy, go to college."

48
00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:20.945
"You can make it if you try."

49
00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:28.036
These elites miss the insult implicit in this advice.
但这些精英忽略了此建议中隐含的侮辱。

50
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.945
If you don't go to college,

51
00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.465
if you don't flourish in the new economy,
如果你不适应新经济，

52
00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.112
your failure is your fault.
那么你的失败就是你自己的错。

53
00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.313
That's the implication.
这就是我说的暗示。

54
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:45.320
It's no wonder many working people turned against meritocratic elites.
所以难怪许多工人反对精英制度。

55
00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.040
So what should we do?
那么我们应该怎么办？

56
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.484
We need to rethink three aspects of our civic life.

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.064

and the meaning of success.
和成功的意义。

60
00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:05.820
We should begin by rethinking the role of universities as arbiters of opportunity.
我们应该重新考虑大学作为机会仲裁者的作用。

61
00:04:07.403 --> 00:04:12.280
For those of us who spend our days in the company of the credentialed,
对于每天和受过高等教育的人打交道的我们，

62
00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:15.573
it's easy to forget a simple fact:
很容易忘掉一个简单的事实：

63
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.345
Most people don't have a four-year college degree.
大多数人没有四年的大学学历。

64
00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:25.028
In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans don't.
实际上，是接近三分之二的美国人都没有。

65
00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:38.362
So it is folly to create an economy that makes a university diploma a necessary condition of dignified work and a decent life.
所以，创造一个使大学文凭成为获得体面工作和生活的必要条件的经济体系是十分荒唐的。

66
00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:42.778
Encouraging people to go to college is a good thing.
鼓励人们去上大学是一件好事。

67
00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:46.968
Broadening access for those who can't afford it is even better.

68
00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:49.945
But this is not a solution to inequality.
然而，这并不是解决不平等问题的方法。

69
00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:56.244
We should focus less on arming people for meritocratic combat,

70
00:04:56.268 --> 00:05:00.002
and focus more on making life better

00:05:02.463 --> 00:05:06.597
but who make essential contributions to our society.

and place it at the center of our politics.

75
00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:18.115
We should remember that work is not only about making a living,

76
00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.564

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.492
Robert F. Kennedy put it well half a century ago.

79
00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:32.620
Fellowship, community, shared patriotism.

80
00:05:33.258 --> 00:05:36.592

81
00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:39.487
from just buying and consuming goods together.

82
00:05:40.683 --> 00:05:44.976
They come from dignified employment, at decent pay.

83
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.758
The kind of employment that enables us to say,

85
00:05:51.342 --> 00:05:55.320
I am a participant in its great public ventures."

86
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.445
This civic sentiment is largely missing from our public life today.
这种公民情感在如今的公共生活中严重缺失。

87
00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:08.385
We often assume that the money people make

88
00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.698
is the measure of their contribution to the common good.
是他们对共同利益所做贡献的衡量。

89
00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:14.444

90
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.987
Martin Luther King Jr. explained why.

Reflecting on a strike by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, shortly before he was assassinated,

99
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.453
