00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.636
I published this article in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.
今年1月份我将这篇文章发表在《纽约时报》“现代爱情”专栏。

2
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.996
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."
《想爱上某人，你要这么做》

3
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.316
And the article is about a psychological study
这篇文章讲的是一项心理学研究，

4
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.756
designed to create romantic love in the laboratory,
如何在实验室创造出浪漫的爱情，

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.396
and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer.
我自己在去年一个夏夜也完成了这项试验。

6
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.156
So the procedure is fairly simple:
过程很简单：

7
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.036
two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions
两个陌生人轮流问对方 36个问题，问题越来越私人化，

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.956
and then they stare into each other's eyes
然后四目相对，

9
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.540
without speaking for four minutes.
一言不发地对视4分钟。

10
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.556
So here are a couple of sample questions.
我选出了其中几个问题。

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.836
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability,
问题12:如果你明早醒来能获得一项品质或能力，

12
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.060
what would it be?
你希望是什么？

13
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.756
Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
问题28:你上一次当着别人的面哭是什么时候？

14
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.996
By yourself?
（上一次）独自哭泣呢？

15
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.276
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
如大家所见，这些问题的确越来越私人化。

16
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.676
Number 30, I really like this one:
问题30，我很喜欢这一个：

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.556
Tell your partner what you like about them;
告诉对面的人，你喜欢他（她）什么，

18
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.436
be very honest this time,
要非常诚实，

19
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.820
saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
说一些你也许不会对初次见面的人说的话。

20
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.196
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier,
因此当我几年前偶然听说这个实验的时候，

21
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.316
one detail really stuck out to me,
有一个细节真的打动了我，

22
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.916
and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later,
我听到传言，说有两个参加实验的人在半年后结婚了，

23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.116
and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
他俩邀请了整个实验团队去参加婚礼。

24
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.996
So I was of course very skeptical
当然，我非常怀疑

25
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.650
about this process of just manufacturing romantic love,
这种完全人造的浪漫爱情，

26
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.556
but of course I was intrigued.
但同时我也很好奇。

27
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.996
And when I got the chance to try this study myself,
当我自己也有机会去完成这个实验时

28
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.150
with someone I knew but not particularly well,
——和一个我认识但不是很熟的人——

29
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.316
I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
我完全没想到我们会陷入爱河。

30
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.036
But then we did, and --
但是我们真的陷进去了，而且——

31
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.956
(Laughter)
（笑声）

32
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.108
And I thought it made a good story, 
我认为这是一个精彩的故事， 

33
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.196
so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later.
所以几个月后，我将它发给了 “现代爱情”专栏。

34
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.940
Now, this was published in January,
今年一月，文章发表了，

35
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.396
and now it is August,
现在是八月份，

36
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.036
so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering,
所以我想你们中间肯定有人在想，

37
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.436
are we still together?
我俩是不是还在一起？

38
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.835
And the reason I think you might be wondering this
我之所以知道你们想问，

39
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.516
is because I have been asked this question
是因为过去七个月里，

40
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.476
again and again and again for the past seven months.
我已经被问了无数次。

41
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.196
And this question is really what I want to talk about today.
我今天真的想回答这个问题。

42
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.676
But let's come back to it.
但是让我们先说说别的。

43
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.676
(Laughter)
（笑声）

44
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.676
So the week before the article came out,
在文章发表前一周，

45
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.396
I was very nervous.
我非常紧张。

46
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.996
I had been working on a book about love stories
我一直在写一本关于爱情的书，

47
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.830
for the past few years,
已经好几年了，

48
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.676
so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences
我已经习惯于在我的博客上

49
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.716
with romantic love on my blog.
分享我自己的爱情经历。

50
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.316
But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most,
然而博客可能最多只有几百人在看，

51
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.436
and those were usually just my Facebook friends,
而且大多数是我“脸书”上的好友，

52
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.036
and I figured my article in the New York Times
而我发表到《纽约时报》上的文章，

53
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.860
would probably get a few thousand views.
可能会有几千人看。

54
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.676
And that felt like a lot of attention
对一段刚刚确定的关系而言，

55
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.876
on a relatively new relationship.
关注的人有点太多了（不是件好事儿）。

56
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.180
But as it turned out, I had no idea.
但对随之而来的事情，我毫无准备。

57
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.956
So the article was published online
这篇文章上线

58
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.036
on a Friday evening,
是在一个周五的晚上，

59
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.196
and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
到周六的时候，我的博客访问量 （暴涨）成了这个样子。

60
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.100
And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
到周日的时候，《今日秀》和《早安美国》都给我打电话了。

61
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.076
Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views,
一个月之内，这篇文章被点击超过800万次，

62
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.396
and I was, to say the least,
所以，对我而言，

63
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.316
underprepared for this sort of attention.
我对如此高的关注度毫无准备。

64
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.436
It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love,
鼓起勇气，如实写出自己的恋爱经历是一回事；

65
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.916
but it is another thing to discover
而发现自己的爱情故事

66
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.916
that your love life has made international news --
成为国际新闻就是另一回事了。

67
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.156
(Laughter)
（笑声）

68
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.996
and to realize that people across the world
更别说全世界人民

69
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.996
are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.
都在关注你的新恋情进展了。

70
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.196
(Laughter)
（笑声）

71
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.036
And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks,
人们每天给我打电话，发邮件，持续了好几周，

72
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.396
they always asked the same question first:
他们都会问同样的问题：

73
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.076
are you guys still together?
你们还在一起吗？

74
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.436
In fact, as I was preparing this talk,
实际上，在我准备这次演讲时，

75
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.716
I did a quick search of my email inbox
我在收件箱里搜索句子，

76
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.676
for the phrase "Are you still together?"
“你们还在一起吗？”

77
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.396
and several messages popped up immediately.
蹦出来好多结果。

78
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.075
They were from students and journalists
问的人有学生，有记者，

79
00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.116
and friendly strangers like this one.
还有善意的陌生人，就像这一位。

80
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.596
I did radio interviews and they asked.
我参加电台访谈节目，他们也会问我。

81
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.556
I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage,
甚至有一次我在做演讲，有一位女士大叫着跑上台，

82
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.916
"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"
“嘿，曼迪，你的男朋友呢？”

83
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.236
And I promptly turned bright red.
我立刻就脸红了。

84
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.076
I understand that this is part of the deal.
我能理解他们的反应。

85
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.636
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper,
既然你在一家国际性的报纸上写出自己的爱情故事，

86
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.316
you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
你就应该预料到大家会毫无顾忌地问这问那。

87
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.276
But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
但我只是没想到反响会如此之大。

88
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.156
The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
这36个问题仿佛有了自己的生命力。

89
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.836
In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article for Valentine's Day,
实际上，《纽约时报》为情人节又发表了 一篇后续文章，

90
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.356
which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves,
讲的是读者们自己进行实验的经历，

91
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.660
with varying degrees of success.
他们的成功率各不相同。

92
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.996
So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention
所以面对如此多的关注，我的第一反应

93
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.460
was to become very protective of my own relationship.
就是要保护我的恋爱关系。

94
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.756
I said no to every request for the two of us
对于所有要我俩共同接受采访的媒体，

95
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.116
to do a media appearance together.
我都拒绝了。

96
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.836
I turned down TV interviews,
我不接受电视采访，

97
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.996
and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
我拒绝提供两人的合照。

98
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.590
I think I was afraid that we would become
我觉得我是害怕被贴上

99
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.756
inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love,
对待爱情太过随意的标签，

100
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.500
a position I did not at all feel qualified for.
我接受不了这种评价。

101
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.036
And I get it:
我明白：

102
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.836
people didn't just want to know if the study worked,
人们不光想知道这实验有没有效，

103
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.796
they wanted to know if it really worked:
他们还想知道这实验会不会真的成功：

104
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.516
that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last,
也就是说，刻意制造出来的爱情能否持久，

105
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.916
not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
不是昙花一现，而是能持续下去的真爱。

106
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.036
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
但这个问题我没办法回答。

107
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.756
My own relationship was only a few months old,
因为我的感情也才开始几个月而已，

108
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.540
and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
而且我觉得这个问题问得不对。

109
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.996
What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
知道我俩是否在一起能起什么作用呢？

110
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.670
If the answer was no,
如果我们分手了，

111
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.900
would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions any less worthwhile?
是不是意味着做这36道题就没什么意义了呢？

112
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.796
Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997,
这些问题最初是亚瑟·阿伦博士在1997年的这项研究中设计出来的，

113
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.556
and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
当时，研究者的目的并不是要制造爱情。

114
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.996
Instead, they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students,
而是想增进大学生之间的人际关系，

115
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.756
by using what Aron called
通过阿伦所谓的

116
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.676
"sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."
“持续的、不断深入的、双向的、自我人格剖析”。

117
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.180
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?
听起来真是浪漫啊，不是吗？

118
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.076
But the study did work.
但这项研究确实有效。

119
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.156
The participants did feel closer after doing it,
参与者确实感觉比实验前更亲密了，

120
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.476
and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol
随后的几项研究同样使用了阿伦的快速交友模式，

121
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.636
as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.
以此来在陌生人之间迅速地建立信任，消除隔阂。

122
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.089
They've used it between members of the police and members of community,
他们将这种方法用在警察和社区成员之间，

123
00:07:19.113 --> 00:07:22.673
and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.
用在持不同政见的人群之间。

124
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.396
The original version of the story,
这个故事的初始版本，

125
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.916
the one that I tried last summer,
也就是我去年夏天完成的，

126
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.156
that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact,
将私人问题和4分钟眼神交流结合在一起，

127
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.276
was referenced in this article,
在这篇文章里也提到了，

128
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.900
but unfortunately it was never published.
但不幸的是这篇文章从未被发表。

129
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.796
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college,
几个月前，我在一所小型文理学院做演讲，

130
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.516
and a student came up to me afterwards
演讲结束后，一名男生过来找我，

131
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.460
and he said, kind of shyly,
他怯生生地说，

132
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.196
"So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
“嗯，我试过你的方法了，但是不管用。”

133
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.476
He seemed a little mystified by this.
他看起来很迷茫的样子。

134
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.276
"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.
“你的意思是，你没有爱上跟你一起做实验的那个人？”我问。

135
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.716
"Well..." He paused.
“也许……”他停顿了一下。

136
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.220
"I think she just wants to be friends."
“我觉得她只想与我做朋友。”

137
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.036
"But did you become better friends?" I asked.
“但你们的关系是不是比以前更好了？”我又问。

138
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.716
"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"
“你有没有觉得实验之后，你俩对彼此的了解都有所加深？”

139
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.036
He nodded.
他点了点头。

140
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.996
"So, then it worked," I said.
“那么，这个实验就是管用的。”我说

141
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.220
I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
我知道这不是他想得到的答案。

142
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.596
In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for
事实上，我认为这不是任何人想要得到的答案，

143
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.876
when it comes to love.
尤其是他们在寻找爱情的时候。

144
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.116
I first came across this study when I was 29
我第一次完成这个实验的时候是29岁，

145
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.556
and I was going through a really difficult breakup.
当时我正在经历一场非常痛苦的分手。

146
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.196
I had been in the relationship since I was 20,
这段感情是从我20岁时开始的，

147
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.996
which was basically my entire adult life,
几乎贯穿了我成年后的所有岁月，

148
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.110
and he was my first real love,
他是我第一个真正爱的人，

149
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:51.236
and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
我无法想象没有他的人生会是怎样。

150
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.636
So I turned to science.
于是我求助于科学。

151
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.236
I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love,
我研究了所有我能找到的关于爱情的科学资料，

152
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.356
and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
我觉得我当时是想以此来疗伤。

153
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.020
I don't know if I realized this at the time --
我不知道当时我有没有意识到这一点——

154
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.236
I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing --
我认为自己只是在为写的书做研究——

155
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.676
but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
但事后回想，当时确实是想借此疗伤。

156
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.116
I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love,
我当时希望用爱情的知识武装自己，

157
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.780
I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
也许失恋带来的伤害和孤独感就不会那么强烈。

158
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.436
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
这些知识最后都或多或少发挥了作用，

159
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.756
I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.
我对爱情更加有耐心。我变得不那么执着。

160
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.356
I am more confident about asking for what I want.
我也更加有自信去追求自己想要的。

161
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.116
But I can also see myself more clearly,
但同时我也能更加清晰地认识自己，

162
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.396
and I can see that what I want is sometimes more
我发现我想要的很多，

163
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.476
than can reasonably be asked for.
有时候甚至是一些只能意会的东西。

164
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.956
What I want from love is a guarantee,
我希望爱情是一种保障，

165
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.196
not just that I am loved today
并不仅仅是今天被爱，

166
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.636
and that I will be loved tomorrow,
或者明天被爱，

167
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.860
but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
而是被我爱的这个人永远地爱下去。

168
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.556
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about
也许大家关心我俩是不是还在一起真正的原因在于

169
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.300
when they wanted to know if we were still together.
大家都想看看这种保障是否真的存在。

170
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.556
So the story that the media told about the 36 questions
因此媒体对这36道题的故事感兴趣的真正原因

171
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.876
was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
在于大家好奇：爱情是否存在捷径。

172
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.636
There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved,
也许存在某种方法，可以降低爱情的风险，

173
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.276
and this is a very appealing story,
而这个实验本身，也非常吸引人，

174
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.476
because falling in love feels amazing,
因为爱上某人的感觉非常奇妙，

175
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.236
but it's also terrifying.
但同时也让人感到害怕。

176
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.836
The moment you admit to loving someone,
当你承认爱上某人的那一刻起，

177
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.500
you admit to having a lot to lose,
也就意味着你要放弃很多东西，

178
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.676
and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism
但这些问题的确提供了一种

179
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.996
for getting to know someone quickly,
快速了解一个人的途径，

180
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.556
which is also a mechanism for being known,
同时也提供了你被人了解的途径，

181
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.036
and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love:
我想，我们大多数人都希望从爱情中获得以下东西：

182
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.140
to be known, to be seen, to be understood.
被了解，被关注，被理解。

183
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.956
But I think when it comes to love,
但我也认为，当谈到爱情时，

184
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.476
we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
我们有时太过简单粗暴，

185
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.076
The version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"
简单到只想问“你们是否还在一起？”，

186
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.220
and is content with a yes or no answer.
而这个问题只用是和否就可以回答。

187
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.316
So rather than that question,
因此相对这个问题，

188
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.996
I would propose we ask some more difficult questions,
我建议大家问一些更深的问题，

189
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.220
questions like:
比如：

190
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.916
How do you decide who deserves your love
你如何确定谁值得你爱？

191
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.180
and who does not?
谁不值得？

192
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.916
How do you stay in love when things get difficult,
当遇到困难时你如何维系爱情，

193
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.460
and how do you know when to just cut and run?
你如何判断何时该分手，各走各的路？

194
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.636
How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship,
你如何处理每段感情都可能出现的信任问题，

195
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.276
or even harder,
甚至比这更难一点，

196
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.660
how do you live with your partner's doubt?
你如何处理伴侣的不信任？

197
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.236
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions,
我不一定知道这些问题的答案，

198
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.396
but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation
但我认为，我们以更加成熟的方式来讨论爱情

199
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.580
about what it means to love someone.
会是一个不错的开始。

200
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.236
So, if you want it,
当然，如果你们坚持想要知道

201
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.556
the short version of the story of my relationship is this:
我的爱情故事缩略版，我满足你们：

202
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.676
a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study
一年前，我和一个熟人进行了一次实验，

203
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.396
designed to create romantic love,
看爱情能否被制造出来，

204
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.116
and we fell in love,
结果我们相爱了，

205
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.996
and we are still together,
现在也没有分开，

206
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.180
and I am so glad.
我非常开心。

207
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.620
But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
但坠入爱河与维持爱情是两回事。

208
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.660
Falling in love is the easy part.
相爱容易相守难。

209
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.778
So at the end of my article, I wrote, 
所以在文章结尾，我写到， 

210
00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:27.876
"Love didn't happen to us. We're in love because we each made the choice to be."
“爱情不是从天而降的。我们相爱是因为我们选择了相爱。”

211
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.076
And I cringe a little when I read that now,
再读这句话时，我有点不好意思，

212
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.396
not because it isn't true,
不是因为这句话不对，

213
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.636
but because at the time, I really hadn't considered
而是当时，我对选择相爱意味着什么，

214
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.276
everything that was contained in that choice.
并没有考虑得那么周全。

215
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.516
I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice,
我没有考虑，有多少次我们本应该下定决心相爱，

216
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.116
and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice
以及在不知道对方是否选择我的前提下，

217
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.956
without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
未来我还需要下多少次决心。

218
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:59.476
I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions,
我希望通过36个问题的问和答，

219
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.716
and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun
通过选择一个如此慷慨、善良、风趣的人相爱，

220
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.740
and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
通过将我的选择在全美最大的报纸上曝光，已经足够我认定这个选择了。

221
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.796
But what I have done instead is turn my relationship
然而我所做的却是将我的爱情

222
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.996
into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
变成了一个我自己都不怎么相信的神话故事。

223
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.250
And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting,
我现在追求的，也许我一辈子都会去追求的，

224
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.996
is for that myth to be true.
就是让这个神话成真。

225
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.796
I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article,
我希望一个幸福的结局，就像我文章标题所暗示的，

226
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.316
which is, incidentally,
顺便说一句，

227
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.996
the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
整篇文章只有那个标题不是我写的。

228
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.300
(Laughter)
（笑声）

229
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.036
But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone,
但是我有机会去选择我爱的人，

230
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.516
and the hope that he will choose to love me back,
也希望他能爱我，

231
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.236
and it is terrifying,
这事儿挺让人害怕的，

232
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.996
but that's the deal with love.
但这就是爱情。

233
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.260
Thank you.
谢谢大家。
