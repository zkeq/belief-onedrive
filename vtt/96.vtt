16
00:00:54.372 --> 00:00:56.699
as much as it should make us feel hopeful,

17
00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.508
because if we have the power to create these problems,

of how to develop technology,
非常长远的观点

40
00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.387
and it was going to be a very expensive technology,

42
00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:01.467
So I wanted to develop something that we could

44
00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:07.307
and that would be open-source, so, because
并且开源的技术

45
00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:09.475
oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,
因为原油泄漏并不仅仅发生在墨西哥湾

46
00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:12.091
and that would be using renewable energy.
而且那会使用可再生能源

47
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.491
So I quit my dream job,
所以我放弃了我梦想的工作

48
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.107
and I moved to New Orleans,

51
00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:22.769
that they were using these small fishing boats,
用这些小渔船来清理

52
00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.929
and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.
而且他们只是在大片被污染的海洋中清理出几条干净的航线

53
00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.642
If you're using the exact same amount of surface
如果你用同样面积的

54
00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:31.795
of oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention
原油吸收船，但你会注意到

55
00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:34.128
to natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,
更自然的模式，如果你逆风航行

56
00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:35.896
you can collect a lot more material.
就能收集到更多原油

57
00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:38.017
If you're multiplying the rig,
如果你增加船只

58
00:02:38.017 --> 00:02:40.592
so you multiply how many layers of absorbent
你就能增加吸收材料的层数

59
00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:42.494
you're using, you can collect a lot more.
那你就能收集到更多更多的原油

60
00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:45.095
But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent
但让吸收原油的船

61
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:48.727
against the winds, the surface currents and the waves.
逆着风向，洋流和海浪航行是极其困难的

62
00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:50.191
These are enormous forces.
那些都是非常强大的力量

63
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.214
So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique
所以最简单的方法是用古代的科技

64
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.467
of sailing and tacking of the wind
来航行和改变航向

65
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.085
to capture or intercept the oil
从而收集或拦截

66
00:02:58.085 --> 00:02:59.427
that is drifting down the wind.
顺着风向蔓延的原油

67
00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:02.924
So this didn't require any invention.
这并不需要任何发明

68
00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:04.627
We just took a simple sailing boat
我们只是拿一艘简单的帆船

69
00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:06.524
and we tried to pull something long and heavy,
然后设法让它拖着一些又长又重的东西

70
00:03:06.524 --> 00:03:08.836
but as we tacked back and forth,
但当我们来回穿梭的时候

71
00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:10.507
what we lost was two things:
我们无法保持两件事

72
00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:13.884
we were losing pulling power and direction.
我们失去了拉动力和方向

73
00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:17.716
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder
所以我想，我们把船舵

74
00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:19.228
from the back of the boat to the front,
从船后面拿到前面来会怎么样呢？

75
00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:20.971
would we have better control?
我们能控制的更好吗？

76
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.187
So I built this small sailing robot
所以我做了这只小帆船机器人

77
00:03:23.187 --> 00:03:24.435
with the rudder at the front,
它的舵在前面

78
00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:26.900
and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,
我试图拖曳一些又长又重的东西

79
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.107
so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,
所以要拖的是个四米长的物体

80
00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:33.019
and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,
让我惊讶的是仅仅14厘米的船舵

81
00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.371
I could control four meters of absorbent.
就能控制四米长的吸收材料

82
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:39.187
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,
我非常高兴能一直摆弄这个小机器

83
00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.651
and so you see the robot has
你能看到这只机器船

84
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.323
a front rudder here.
有一个舵在前面

85
00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.539
Normally it's at the back.
正常的话它应该在后面

86
00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:48.154
And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability
我摆弄它的时候注意到

87
00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:49.434
of this was really amazing,
它的可控性是惊人的

88
00:03:49.434 --> 00:03:51.362
and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,
我能在最后一秒躲开一个障碍物

89
00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.034
more maneuverable than a normal boat.
它比一般的船可控性更强

90
00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:55.898
Then I started publishing online, and
接着我开始在网上发布

91
00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.810
some friends from Korea, they started being
一些来自韩国的朋友开始对这项发明感兴趣

92
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.539
interested in this, and we made a boat
所以我们又做了一艘船

93
00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.347
which has a front rudder and a back rudder,
它前面后面都有船舵

94
00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:04.405
so we started interacting with this,
所以我们开始与它互动

95
00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:06.524
and it was slightly better,
它又变好了一点

96
00:04:06.524 --> 00:04:08.448
although it was very small and a bit off balance,
尽管它很小还有一点不平衡

97
00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.528
but then we thought,
但之后我们想

98
00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:11.416
what if we have more than two points of control?
我们再多加一些控制点会怎样呢？

99
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:13.408
What if the entire boat becomes a point of control?
如果整艘船变成一个控制点会怎样呢？

100
00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:15.528
What if the entire boat changes shape?
整艘船的形状能够改变会怎样呢？

101
00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:17.968
So — (Applause)
所以--（掌声）

102
00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:19.864
Thank you very much. (Applause)
非常感谢（掌声）

103
00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:22.449
And so that's the beginning of Protei,
这就是Protei的开始

104
00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.088
and that's the first boat in history
这是历史上第一艘

105
00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:25.712
that completely changed the shape of the hull
能够完全改变船身形状的船

106
00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:26.882
in order to control it,
这是为了能更好的控制它

107
00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:29.768
and the properties of sailing that we get
这艘帆船的性能

108
00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.666
are very superior compared to a normal boat.
也比一般的船好得多

109
00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:35.320
When we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,
当我们转向的时候， 我们有一种冲浪的感觉

110
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.436
and the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.
还有它逆风航行的时候，它非常高效

111
00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:42.136
This is low speed, low wind speed,
这是低速--低风速的状态

112
00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:44.209
and the maneuverability is very increased,
可控性提高了很多

113
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:46.520
and here I'm going to do a small jibe,
我来做个小转向

114
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.616
and look at the position of the sail.
看帆的位置

115
00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:52.216
What's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,
现在，因为船身变形了

116
00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:54.556
the position of the front sail and the main sail
前帆的位置和主控帆的位置

117
00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:55.733
are different to the wind.
对风向来说是不同的

118
00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.616
We're catching wind from both sides.
我们在两个方向都兜住了风

119
00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:59.875
And this is exactly what we're looking [for]
这正是我们所期待的

120
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:01.659
if we want to pull something long and heavy.
如果我们需要拉动一些又长又重的东西

121
00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.048
We don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.
我们就既不能失去拉动力也不能失去方向

122
00:05:04.048 --> 00:05:06.888
So, I wanted to know if this was possible
所以我想知道有没有可能

123
00:05:06.888 --> 00:05:08.359
to put this at an industrial level,
把它投入工业化生产

124
00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:10.871
so we made a large boat with a large sail,
所以我们做了一艘有更大的帆的船

125
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.567
and with a very light hull, inflatable,
它的船身非常轻，充气式的

126
00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:15.072
very small footprint,
在水面激起的涟漪很小

127
00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:17.896
so we have a very big size and power ratio.
我们的船尺寸很大而且动力很强

128
00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:21.127
After this, we wanted to see if we could
这之后， 我们想看看我们能否

129
00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:23.424
implement this and automate the system,
实施并实现系统的自动化

130
00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:25.096
so we used the same system but we added
所以我们应用了相同的系统但又加了

131
00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:27.466
a structure to it so we could activate the machine.
一个结构， 这样我们就能启动这台机器了

132
00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:30.680
So, we used the same bladder-inflated system,
所以， 我们应用了相同的囊状充气式系统

133
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.664
and we took it for testing.
然后我们拿它做了一次测试

134
00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:34.975
So this is happening in the Netherlands.
这是在荷兰

135
00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:37.506
We tried in the water without any skin or ballast
我们把它放在水里，没有加外壳和任何装载物

136
00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:40.077
just to see how it works.
只是看看它是如何工作的

137
00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:42.762
And then we mounted a camera for controlling it,
我们装了一架摄像机来控制它

138
00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:45.664
but quickly we saw that we would need
但很快我们就发现

139
00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:47.813
a lot more weight at the bottom,
底部需要更多重量

140
00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:49.350
so we had to take it back to the lab,
所以我们只好把它拿回实验室

141
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.438
and then we built a skin around it,
并给它装上外壳

142
00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:54.725
we put batteries, remote controllers, and then
我们装了电池，遥控器

143
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:56.173
we put it in the water and then we
然后我们把它放在水中，接着我们

144
00:05:56.173 --> 00:05:59.334
let it go in the water and see how well it would work,
让它在水中自由航行，看它工作的有多好

145
00:05:59.334 --> 00:06:02.758
so let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,
我们拿掉绳子，希望它能运转的很好

146
00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.981
and it worked okay, but we still have a long way.
它运行的还行，但我们还有很长的路要走

147
00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:08.417
Our small prototype has given us good insight
我们的小模型让我们相信

148
00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:09.763
that it's working very well,
这项技术会发展的很好

149
00:06:09.763 --> 00:06:12.448
but we still need to work a lot more on this.
但我们还是有很多工作要做

150
00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:16.317
So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution
所以我们现在所做的

151
00:06:16.317 --> 00:06:17.765
of sailing technology.
是对帆船的改进科技

152
00:06:17.765 --> 00:06:19.692
We went from a back rudder to a front rudder
我们从后置船舵到前置船舵

153
00:06:19.692 --> 00:06:21.703
to two rudders to multiple rudders
从双舵到多船舵

154
00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:23.374
to the whole boat changing shape,
再到改变整个船身的形状

155
00:06:23.374 --> 00:06:25.230
and the more we are moving forward,
我们进展的越多

156
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.277
and the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)
这个设计就变得越简单可爱(笑声）

157
00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:33.654
But I wanted to show you a fish because --
但我想给你们看一条鱼，因为——

158
00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:36.724
In fact, it's very different from a fish.
实际上，它和鱼很不同

159
00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:41.124
A fish will move because -- by changing like this,
鱼会游是因为--它们会改变形状

160
00:06:41.124 --> 00:06:44.223
but our boat is propelled by the wind still,
但我们的船依旧是靠风力推动的

161
00:06:44.223 --> 00:06:46.630
and the hull controls the trajectory.
而且由船身控制行进轨道

162
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.284
So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage
所以我第一次在TED上把Protei 八号展示给你们

163
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.669
Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one,
这不是最新型号

164
00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.918
but it's a good one for making demos.
但这很适合用来做演示

165
00:06:54.918 --> 00:06:57.194
So the first thing as I show you in the video is
就像我在录像里给你们展示的一样，首先我要给你们看的是

166
00:06:57.194 --> 00:07:01.181
that we may be able to control the trajectory
我们也许可以更好的

167
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:02.645
of a sailing boat better,
控制帆船的行进轨道

168
00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:05.706
or we may be able to never be in irons,
或者我们再也不会背离风向

169
00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:07.006
so never facing the wind,
所以不会逆风行驶

170
00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:09.121
we always can catch the wind from both sides.
我们总是可以两面都迎风

171
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:11.681
But new properties of a sailing boat.
这些都是帆船的新性能

172
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.937
So if you're looking at the boat from this side,
所以如果你从这个方向看这艘船

173
00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:18.145
this might remind you of an airplane profile.
这或许会让你想到飞机的侧面

174
00:07:18.145 --> 00:07:20.558
An airplane, when you're moving in this direction,
如果是飞机的话， 当你往这个方向移动的时候

175
00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:22.823
starts to lift, and that's how it takes off.
开始上升， 然后它就这样起飞了

176
00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:24.998
Now, if you're taking the same system,
现在， 如果你用相同的系统

177
00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:27.366
and you're putting vertical, you're bending,
如果你把它竖着放，它就会变弯

178
00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:29.366
and if you're moving this way forward,
如果你让它往这个方向移动

179
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.493
your instinct will tell you that you might go this way,
你的直觉将会告诉你它将往这个方向运动

180
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.300
but if you're moving fast enough,
但如果它移动的足够快

181
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.319
you might create what we call lateral lift,
你将会造成我们所谓的侧面上升

182
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.244
so we could get further or closer to the wind.
所以我们就能走的更远或者更接近风

183
00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:42.188
Other property is this:
它的另一个性能是

184
00:07:42.188 --> 00:07:45.349
A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here
一个普通的帆船在这儿有一个中插板

185
00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:47.341
and a rudder at the back,
和一个在后面的船舵

186
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.891
and these two things are what creates most
这两件东西给船造成最多

187
00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:52.545
resistance and turbulence behind the boat,
阻力和摇晃

188
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:54.816
but because this doesn't have either
但因为这个既没有

189
00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.352
a centerboard or a rudder,
中插板也没有船舵

190
00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:59.224
we hope that if we keep working on this hull design
我们希望如果我们在这种船身设计上努力

191
00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:01.416
we can improve and have less resistance.
我们能改进并减少阻力

192
00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:04.071
The other thing is, most boats, when they reach
另外， 大部分船， 当它们达到

193
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:06.295
a certain speed, and they are going on waves,
一定的速度，而且在风浪中航行的时候

194
00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:08.734
they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,
它们就会撞击和拍打水面

195
00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:12.031
and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.
这样就会消耗很多前进的能量

196
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:14.119
But if we're going with the flow,
但如果我们顺着水流行进

197
00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.255
if we pay attention to natural patterns
如果我们注意自然的模式

198
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:17.866
instead of trying to be strong,
而不是试图与之对抗

199
00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:20.265
but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb
如果你顺着水流航行，我们会吸收

200
00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:23.462
a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,
很多来自于环境的噪音，也就是海浪的能量

201
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:26.619
to actually save some energy to move forward.
这样就能节省一些前进的能量

202
00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:30.770
So we may have developed the technology
所以我们可能已经研发出一项技术

203
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.437
which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,
它可以非常高效地拖曳又长又重的东西

204
00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:37.654
but the idea is, what is the purpose of technology
但问题是，如果不能给合适的人群使用

205
00:08:37.654 --> 00:08:39.600
if it doesn't reach the right hands?
科技的目的又是什么呢？

206
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.546
Normal technology or innovation happens like this:
正常的科技或创新是这样发生的：

207
00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:44.976
Somebody has an interesting idea,
有人有了一个有趣的想法

208
00:08:44.976 --> 00:08:46.938
some other scientist or engineer,
其他一些科学家或工程师

209
00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:49.442
they take it to the next level, they make a theory about it
会将它带入下个阶段， 他们建立关于它的理论

210
00:08:49.442 --> 00:08:50.698
and maybe they patent it,
然后申请专利

211
00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:53.234
and then some industry will make a contract
接着一些企业会签订合约

212
00:08:53.234 --> 00:08:56.378
of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,
进而独自生产和销售它

213
00:08:56.378 --> 00:08:58.474
and then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,
然后，终于，一个买家将会购买它

214
00:08:58.474 --> 00:09:01.242
and we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.
但我们希望他们会以好的目的去利用它

215
00:09:01.242 --> 00:09:04.938
What we really want is that this innovation happens
我们真正希望的是这项创造

216
00:09:04.938 --> 00:09:07.274
continuously. The inventor and engineers
会持续发生 --发明者和工程师

217
00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:09.010
and also the manufacturers and everybody
还有制造商和所有人

218
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.394
works at the same time, but this would be sterile
同时工作，但如果他们各自的工作以平行的没有交集

219
00:09:11.394 --> 00:09:15.026
if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.
的方式进行，将毫无结果

220
00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:17.066
What you really want is not a sequential,
你想要的不是一连串的

221
00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:18.458
not parallel development.
互相平行的发展

222
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.067
You want to have a network of innovation.
你想要一个创新的网络

223
00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:22.146
You want everybody, like we're doing now,

225
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.706
if these people all together decide to share the information,
大家共同决定共享信息的情况下才能发生

226
00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:31.646
and that's exactly what open hardware is about.

227
00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:35.315
It's to replace competition by collaboration.

228
00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:39.466
It's to transform any new product into a new market.

229
00:09:39.466 --> 00:09:41.907
So what is open hardware?
所以，什么是硬件开源呢？

230
00:09:41.907 --> 00:09:43.690
Essentially, open hardware is a license.
实际上， 硬件开源是一个协议

231
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.762
It's just an intellectual property setup.
它只是一项知识产权计划

232
00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:48.786
It means that everybody is free to use,
它意味着每个人都有权

233

237
00:09:58.048 --> 00:09:59.376
they share back with the community.
他们在协作社区中相互分享

238
00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:00.712
So it's a very simple condition.

240
00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:06.912
but quickly after I wanted to publish and share
