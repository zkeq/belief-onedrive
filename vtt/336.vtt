1
00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:16.056
I've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years,
我在非洲的乡村生活了差不多10年，

2
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.260
and I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty.
我想和你们分享关于全球贫困的前景。

3
00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.328
I believe that the greatest failure of the human race
我认为人类最大的失败

4
00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:25.758
is the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
是我们罔顾了十多亿我们的同类。

5
00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:28.497
Hungry, extreme poverty:
饥饿，极端贫穷：

6
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:31.809
these often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems,
这些巨大的无法驾驭的问题，

7
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.266
too big to solve.
看起来已经严重到无法解决。

8
00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:35.535
But as a field practitioner,
但是从实践的角度，

9
00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.363
I believe these are actually very solvable problems
我相信这些都是非常有可能解决的问题，

10
00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.828
if we just take the right strategies.
只需采取正确的战略。

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.325
Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,
阿基米德是古希腊的思想家，

12
00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:46.833
and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers,
他教会我们‘如果用对杠杆的话，

13
00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:48.267
we can move the world.
我们可以翘起地球。’

14
00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:50.566
In the fight against extreme poverty, 
在与极端贫穷的抗争中，

15
00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.892
I believe there are three powerful levers that we can lean on.
我相信有以下三个我们可以依靠的有力杠杆。

16
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.918
This talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty
这个演讲就是关于这些杠杆的，

17
00:00:55.862 --> 00:00:59.764
a winnable fight in our lifetimes.
以及为什么它们可以战胜贫穷。

18
00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:01.216
What is extreme poverty?
什么是极端贫穷？

19
00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:04.102
When I first moved to rural East Africa,
当我第一次到达东非农村的时候，

20
00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:05.976
I stayed overnight with a farm family.
在一个农民家庭里住了一晚。

21
00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:08.549
They were wonderful people.
他们都是很好的人。

22
00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:11.445
They invited me into their home. We sang songs together
他们邀请我去家里。

23
00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.750
and ate a simple dinner.
我们一起唱歌，吃了简单的晚餐，

24
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:14.748
They gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor.
他们还给我毯子铺在地上睡觉。

25
00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.558
In the morning, however, there was nothing to eat.
然而到了早上，什么吃的都没有。

26
00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:21.522
And then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling
然后到了午餐时间，家里的大女儿煮了一些

27
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.953
as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.
让人看到有些反胃的粥，当作午饭。

28
00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:30.727
For that meal, every child drank one cup to survive.
那一餐中，每个孩子都只喝一杯粥果腹。

29
00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:35.392
And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt when they handed one of those cups to me,
当他们也递给我一杯的时候，我惭愧的无以言表。

30
00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:37.868
and I knew I had to accept their hospitality.
然而我必须接受他们的款待。

31
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:42.581
Children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally.
食物之于孩子，不仅仅用来果腹，还用来发育身体和智力。

32
00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:46.251
Every day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future.
对他们来说，多一天饥饿，就少一点未来。

33
00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.816
Amongst the extreme poor, one in three children
在极度贫穷中，每三个孩子中就有一个，

34
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.440
are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough.
由于食物短缺而造成终生发育不良。

35
00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.658
When that's combined with poor access to health care,
贫穷带来的医疗资源短缺，

36
00:01:56.682 --> 00:02:01.142
one in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five.
让十分之一的孩子在5岁之前夭折。

37
00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.176
And only one quarter of children complete high school
只有四分之一的孩子完成了高中学业，

38
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.650
because they lack school fees.
因为剩下的四分之三交不起学费。

39
00:02:05.728 --> 00:02:11.500
Hunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way.
饥饿和极度贫穷，从各方面极大地遏制了人类的发展潜力。

40
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:16.881
We see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race,
我们自认为是有思想、有感受、有道德的人类，

41
00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:19.940
but until we solve these problems for all of our members,
但如果我们不为自己的同类解决这些问题，

42
00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:21.649
we fail that standard,
我们就汗颜于这个标准。

43
00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:24.494
because every person on this planet matters.
因为这个星球上的每个人都重要。

44
00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:26.310
This child matters.
这个孩子，重要，

45
00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:28.704
These children matter.
这些孩子，重要，

46
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.262
This girl matters.
这个女孩儿，也重要。

47
00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.718
You know, we see things like this,
当看到这些的时候，

48
00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:35.319
and we're upset by them,
我们为他们感到难过，

49
00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:37.145
but they seem like such big problems.
我们意识到了问题的严重性，

50
00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.004
We don't know how to take effective action.
但却不知道采取什么样的有效行动。

51
00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:42.610
But remember our friend Archimedes.
还记得我们的朋友阿基米德吗？

52
00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:45.720
Global poverty has powerful levers.
解决全球贫困有一个有力的杠杆，

53
00:02:45.744 --> 00:02:47.333
It's a problem like any other.
与其它问题无异。

54
00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:50.289
I live and work in the field, and as a practitioner,
做为生活和工作在这一领域的实践者，

55
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:53.116
I believe these are very solvable problems.
我相信这些问题都可以解决。

56
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.621
So for the next 10 minutes,
接下来的十分钟，

57
00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:56.799
let's not be sad about the state of the world.
让我们停止悲伤，

58
00:02:56.823 --> 00:02:58.323
Let's engage our brains.
让我们转向头脑，

59
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.423
Let's engage our collective passion for problem-solving
凝聚我们的热情来解决问题，

60
00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.636
and figure out what those levers are.
来找出那些杠杆。

61
00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:07.389
Lever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers.
杠杆一：世界上最穷的人中，大部分是农民。

62
00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:10.040
Think about how extraordinary this is.
想想看这有多么不寻常。

63
00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:12.525
If this picture represents the world's poor,
如果这张图代表了世界范围的穷人，

64
00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.854
then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income.
那么这中间有超过一半儿的人，他们的主要收入来自耕种。

65
00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:18.115
This gets me really excited.
这一发现让我很振奋。

66
00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.491
All of these people, one profession.
所有这些人，拥有同一种职业。

67
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.523
Think how powerful this is.
如此大的力量。

68
00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:26.065
When farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor
如果农民的生产力提高，那么世界上贫困人口中有

69
00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:28.583
earn more money and climb out of poverty.
一半人的收入将会增加，并且脱离贫困。

70
00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:29.737
And it gets better.
不仅如此，

71
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:32.016
The product of farming is, of course, food.
耕种的产品是食物。

72
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.695
So when farmers become more productive, they earn more food,
因此当农民的生产力提高，他们获得更多食物。

73
00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.390
and they don't just help themselves,
除了喂饱自己，

74
00:03:37.414 --> 00:03:40.640
but they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies.
他们还可以向其它地区供应粮食，同时振兴了经济。

75
00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:44.621
And when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure.
当农民的生产力提高，环境压力也随之降低。

76
00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:47.545
We only have two ways we can feed the world:
解决全球粮食问题只有两种办法：

77
00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.892
we can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive,
要么极大提升现有耕种土地的出产率，

78
00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:54.196
or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland,
要么伐木逐原，创造更多的耕地，

79
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.470
which would be environmentally disastrous.
使环境变得更糟。

80
00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.820
Farmers are basically a really important leverage point.
农民可以说是最重要的杠杆支点。

81
00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:03.249
When farmers become more productive,
当农民的生产力提高，

82
00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:05.884
they earn more income, they climb out of poverty,
收入也随之提高，脱离了贫穷，

83
00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:09.983
they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure.
他们不仅养活了自己的社区，还减少了环境压力。

84
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:12.652
Farmers stand at the center of the world.
农民是世界的中心。

85
00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:15.826
And not a farmer like this one,
通常，农民不是这样的，

86
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.445
but rather this lady.
而是像这位女士一样。

87
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.031
Most of the farmers I know are actually women.
事实上我认识的大部分农民都是女性。

88
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.791
Look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman.
看她身上的力量，和传递出的愿望。

89
00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:26.027
She is physically strong, mentally tough,
她身体强壮，精神顽强，

90
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:29.482
and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children.
为了让孩子生活的更好，她可以做任何事情。

91
00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:32.650
If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands,
如果非要将人类的未来交到某个人手里，

92
00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:34.487
then I'm really glad it's her.
那么我真心希望那个人是她。

93
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:39.921
(Applause)
（掌声）

94
00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:41.201
There's just one problem:
只是有一个问题：

95
00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:45.968
many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge.
许多贫农很难获得最基本的工具和知识。

96
00:04:46.568 --> 00:04:50.256
Currently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year,
目前，他们从上一年的存粮里拿出一点，用来播种，

97
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.660
they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe.
这一切都是手工用锄头完成的。

98
00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:56.449
These are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age,
这些都是青铜器时代的工具和技术，

99
00:04:56.473 --> 00:04:59.411
and it's why many farmers are still very poor.
这就是为什么许多农民，一直无法摆脱贫穷。

100
00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:01.957
But good news, again.
但是好消息是，

101
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:03.132
Lever number two:
我们有第二个杠杆：

102
00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:07.522
humanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago.
事实上，早在一个世纪前，人类就解决了农业贫困的问题。

103
00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:11.292
Let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming.
让我们来复习一下农业中的三个基本元素。

104
00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:16.161
First, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together.
第一，杂交种子是将两种种子结合在一起。

105
00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:21.324
If you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety together with a drought-resistant variety,
如果将高产品种和抗旱品种自然杂交，

106
00:05:21.348 --> 00:05:25.186
you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents.
得到的是继承了母本和父本优秀性状的杂交品种。

107
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.907
Next, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly,
然后是传统肥料，如果以负责任的态度使用的话，

108
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.730
is environmentally sustainable.
是环保、可持续发展的。

109
00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:34.247
If you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer
即便只是捏一小撮，

110
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.355
to a plant that's taller than I am,
洒在比我还高的植物上，

111
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.553
you unlock enormous yield gain.
将会得到巨大的产量。

112
00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:40.642
These are known as farm inputs.
这些就是农业投入。

113
00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:43.661
Farm inputs need to be combined with good practice.
农业投入需要与良好的实践相结合。

114
00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:47.779
When you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost,
播种或种植之后使用大量的堆肥，

115
00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:50.356
farmers multiply their harvests.
农作物的产量会倍增。

116
00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:53.342
These proven tools and practices have more than tripled
这些工具和实践，在世界范围的许多地区，

117
00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:56.414
agricultural productivity in every major region of the world,
使农作物产量成三倍增长，

118
00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:59.211
moving mass numbers of people out of poverty.
使大量人民脱离贫困。

119
00:05:59.748 --> 00:06:03.087
We just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet,
但是我们并没有把这些知识传递给所有人，

120
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.852
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
尤其是非洲撒哈拉以南的地区。

121
00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:07.467
So overall, this is amazing news.
总的来说，这是好消息。

122
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:11.047
Humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago,
事实上，人类在一个世纪前就解决了农业贫困，

123
00:06:11.497 --> 00:06:12.704
in theory.
不过是理论上的。

124
00:06:12.728 --> 00:06:15.652
We just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet.
我们还没有将这些知识教给所有人。

125
00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.561
In this century, the reason that people remain poor
本世纪中，使得人们还留在贫困中的，

126
00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:20.791
is because maybe they live in remote places.
也许是因为他们居住在闭塞的地区。

127
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.910
They lack access to these things.
他们无法得知这些知识。

128
00:06:23.974 --> 00:06:26.535
Therefore, ending poverty is simply a matter
因此想要结束贫困，

129
00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.981
of delivering proven goods and services to people.
只需要向人们提供这些已知有效的工具和服务。

130
00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:32.103
We don't need more genius types right now.
不需要天才，

131
00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:36.776
The humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.
谦卑的传递者，就可以在我们有生之年里结束全球贫困。

132
00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:39.396
So these are the three levers,
所以这就是三个杠杆，

133
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.073
and the most powerful lever is simply delivery.
而最有力的一个，是简单的传递。

134
00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:46.140
Wherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits
无论在哪儿，公司、政府、慈善组织，

135
00:06:46.164 --> 00:06:48.863
set up delivery networks for life-improving goods,
只要传递改善生活的产品，

136
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.361
we eliminate poverty.
我们就可以消灭贫穷。

137
00:06:51.843 --> 00:06:53.836
OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,
好吧，理论上听起来不错，

138
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.150
but what about in practice?
但是实践起来呢？

139
00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:57.176
What do these delivery networks look like?
运输网络看起来如何？

140
00:06:57.826 --> 00:07:00.361
I want to share the concrete example that I know best,
我想分享一个我很了解的具体案例，

141
00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.296
my organization, One Acre Fund.
我的组织，‘一亩基金’。

142
00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:04.380
We only serve the farmer,
我们只为农民服务，

143
00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:07.769
and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed.
我们的工作是向她提供所需的工具。

144
00:07:08.104 --> 00:07:11.058
We start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places.
最开始，我们向那些真正贫穷的乡村输送耕地知识。

145
00:07:11.082 --> 00:07:13.348
Now, this may appear initially very challenging,
刚开始看起来非常具有挑战性，

146
00:07:13.372 --> 00:07:15.583
but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.
但可行性非常高。我来展示给你们看。

147
00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:18.667
We buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network,
在网络内的农民的帮助下，我们购买农业投入物资，

148
00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:21.010
and store it in 20 warehouses like this.
并把他们储存在20个像这样的仓库里。

149
00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:25.434
Then, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks
为了运输物资，我们租用上百辆10吨载重量的卡车，

150
00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:28.296
and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field.
把它们送到，在地里等着的农民们的手里。

151
00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:32.211
They then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms.
当拿到了各自的订单到了之后，它们就将其带回自家的农场里。

152
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:34.702
It's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers.
这有点儿像是农民版的亚马逊。

153
00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:40.332
Importantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay.
重要的是，实际传递的还不只是物资，还有更周到的付费方式。

154
00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:44.809
Farmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses.
农民们会分期每次付给我们一点儿，这承担了我们大部分费用。

155
00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:47.544
And then we surround all that with training.
然后这笔费用被我们用来投入培训。

156
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:51.622
Our rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training
我们的农地办事员，为地里的农民

157
00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:52.895
to farmers in the field

158
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:55.320
every two weeks.
每两周一次。

159
00:07:55.316 --> 00:08:00.494
Wherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools to climb out of poverty.
我们提供服务的地方，农民都用这些工具来脱离贫穷。

160
00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.437
This is a farmer in our program, Consolata.
这就是我们项目中其中一个农民，康索拉达。

161
00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:05.696
Look at the pride on her face.
看她脸上那自豪的表情。

162
00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:09.690
She has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right

163
00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:13.077
of every hardworking person on the planet.
我相信这是地球上任何一个劳作者的人权。

164
00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:17.986
Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.
今天，我可以自豪地说，我们服务了四十万个像康索拉达一样的农民。

165
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:23.677
(Applause)
（掌声）

166
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:25.979
The key to doing this is scalable delivery.
做到这点的关键，是扩展性传递。

167
00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:29.191
In any given area, we hire a rural field officer
在每一个指定地区，我们都雇用一名田间办事员，

168
00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:32.371
who delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average,
来向平均200名农民运送我们的服务，

169
00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:35.246
with more than 1,000 people living in those families.
这200名农民的家人总数超过1000人。

171
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.461
growing very quickly.
并且还在不断增多。

172
00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:42.292
This is our delivery army,
这就是我们的传递 ‘武器’，

173
00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:44.478
and we're just one organization.
而我们只是其中一个组织。

174
00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:47.666
There are many companies, governments and nonprofits
还有许多其它的公司、政府和非盈利组织，

175
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.901
that have delivery armies just like this.
它们都有像这样的传递 ‘武器’。

176
00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:51.971
And I believe we stand at a moment in time

177
00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:56.898
where collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers.
通过集体努力，我们有能力做到，向所有农民提供服务。

178
00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:59.352
Let me show you how possible this is.
让我向你们展示这个可能性。

179
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.649
This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,
这是非洲撒哈拉以南的地图，

180
00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:03.778
with a map of the United States for scale.
以及等比例的美国地图。

181
00:09:03.802 --> 00:09:07.190
I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory.
我选择非洲撒哈拉以南，是因为这是一个巨大的运送范围。

182
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.387
It's very challenging.
非常具有挑战性。

183
00:09:09.068 --> 00:09:12.721
But we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent,
但是通过把它拆分成50英里的区域进行分析，

184
00:09:13.112 --> 00:09:17.717
and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions.
我们发现有一半的农民都生活在阴影区域。

185
00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:22.007
That's a remarkably small area overall.
合在一起是个非常小的区域。

186
00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:24.324
If you were to lay these boxes next to each other
如果把这些区域一个挨一个地，

187
00:09:24.348 --> 00:09:25.984
within a map of the United States,
摆在美国地图上，

188
00:09:25.978 --> 00:09:29.103
they would only cover the Eastern United States.
仅仅覆盖了美国东部。

189
00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:32.346
You can order pizza anywhere in this territory
你可以在这片国土上的任何地方叫披萨外卖，

190
00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:35.803
and it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious.
等披萨送到的时候，还是热的、新鲜的、美味的。

191
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:39.668
If America can deliver pizza to an area of this size,
如果美国可以在这样大的区域里送披萨，

192
00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:42.715
then Africa's companies, governments and non-profits
那么非洲的公司、政府和非盈利组织，

193
00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:45.762
can deliver farm services to all of her farmers.
也可以向所有的农民运送农业服务。

194
00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:47.069
This is possible.
这是可行的。

195
00:09:48.815 --> 00:09:51.568
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming.
我想以超越耕种的总结来收尾。

196
00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:54.219
In every field of human development,
在人类发展的每个领域，

197
00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:58.072
humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty.
人类都发明了各种有效工具来终结贫穷。

198
00:09:58.096 --> 00:09:59.507
We just need to deliver them.
我们只需传递它们。

199
00:10:00.142 --> 00:10:02.383
So again, in every area of human development,
再说一次，在人类发展的每一个领域，

200
00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:07.665
super-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive, highly effective tools.
那些极其聪明的人在很久之前就发明了廉价的、高效的工具。

201
00:10:07.689 --> 00:10:09.621
Humanity is armed to the teeth
为了抵抗贫穷，人类已经用简单、有效的武器，

202
00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:12.983
with simple, effective solutions to poverty.
武装到了牙齿。

203
00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:16.188
We just need to deliver these to a pretty small area.
我们只需将这些运送到非常小的区域。

204
00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:20.188
Again using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,
再以这张非洲撒哈拉以南的地图为例，

205
00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:23.686
remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas.
请记住，那些乡村贫穷都集中在蓝色阴影区域。

206
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.144
Urban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots.
城市贫穷更加集中，在这些绿色的小点上。

207
00:10:29.102 --> 00:10:31.618
Again, using a map of the United States for scale,
再来看等比例的美国地图，

208
00:10:32.137 --> 00:10:35.696
this is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone.
我认为这个大小的区域，是极易覆盖运送网的。

209
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:38.328
In fact, for the first time in human history,
实际上，这是人类有史以来第一次，

210
00:10:38.352 --> 00:10:41.851
we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us.

211
00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.599
The world's companies, governments and non-profits

212
00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:46.846
have delivery armies that are fully capable

213
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.253
of covering this relatively small area.
来覆盖这片相对小的地区。

214
00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:51.872
We just lack the will.
我们只是缺少意愿。

215
00:10:52.733 --> 00:10:54.144
If we are willing,
如果我们愿意，

216
00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:55.976
every one of us has a role to play.
我们中的每个人都可以参与进来。

217
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.111
We first need more people to pursue careers in human development,
首先我们需要更多的人去追随人类发展的事业，

218
00:11:01.135 --> 00:11:03.283
especially if you live in a developing nation.

219
00:11:03.307 --> 00:11:06.793
We need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers,
我们需要更多的冲在前线的工人、教师、农民培训员，

220
00:11:06.817 --> 00:11:08.929
sales agents for life-improving goods.

221
00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:13.619
These are the delivery people that dedicate their careers to improving the lives of others.
这些传送者愿意将自己的事业奉献于提升他人生活。

222
00:11:14.352 --> 00:11:16.305
But we also need a lot of support roles.
但我们也需要大量的支持者。

223
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:20.402
These are roles available at just my organization alone,

224
00:11:20.426 --> 00:11:21.916
and we're just one out of many.
然而我们只是众多组织之一。

225
00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:25.993
This may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty,

226
00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:28.227
there is a role for you in this fight.

227
00:11:28.978 --> 00:11:32.325
And no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty,

228
00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:34.244
we need a lot more resources.

229
00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:36.112
This is our number one constraint.
这是对我们最大的约束

230
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:40.007
For private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital,

private equity, working capital, available in emerging markets.
私募股权、运营资金，出现在新兴市场中。

232
00:11:44.297 --> 00:11:47.406
But there are also limits to what private business can accomplish.
但私有企业能做到的还是有限的。

233
00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:51.399
Private businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor,
私有企业挣扎在为赤贫服务和盈利之间，

234
00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:54.049
so philanthropy still has a major role to play.

235
00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:57.371
Anybody can give, but we need more leadership.

239
00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:10.918

We've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets

243

and connect us with anybody on the planet.

244
00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:24.003
We've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace.

245
00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:26.470
We are an exceptional people.

246
00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:30.768
But we've left more than one billion of our members behind.

247
00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:33.603
Until every girl like this one has an opportunity

248
00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:35.525
to earn her full human potential,

249
00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:39.738
we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race.
我们才配称做真正有道德的、公正的人类。

250
00:12:40.336 --> 00:12:43.092
Logistically speaking, it's incredibly possible
逻辑上来说，终结极端贫穷的可能性，

251
00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:44.716
to end extreme poverty.

252
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.922
We just need to deliver proven goods and services

253

to everybody.

00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:53.209
If we have the will, every one of us has a role to play.

255
00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:56.733
Let's deploy our time, our careers,

256
00:12:56.757 --> 00:12:58.008
our collective wealth.

00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:03.028
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty in this lifetime.

258
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:04.942
Thank you.

00:13:04.966 --> 00:13:11.966
