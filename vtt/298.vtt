1
00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:16.833
We need to change the culture in our jails and prisons,

2
00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.340
especially for young inmates.
特别要为了少年犯们。

3
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.662
New York state is one of only two in the U.S.

4
00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:26.160
that automatically arrests and tries 16- to 17-year-olds as adults.

5
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.117
This culture of violence takes these young people
监狱中的这种暴力文化会侵蚀这些年轻人,

6
00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:31.159
and puts them in a hostile environment,
并将他们置于一个敌对的环境中，

7
00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.201
and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on.
而监狱中的看守几乎是任由这些事情发生。

8
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.008
There's not really much for these young people to do
事实上这些年轻人并没有多少事情可以做，

9
00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:41.538
to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them.
来提升自己的才能，并得到改造。

10
00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:46.104
Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18,
除非我们能将需要负刑事责任的年龄提高到18岁，

11
00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:49.355
we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people.
否则我们就需要集中精力去改变这些少年犯的日常生活。

12
00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:51.549
I know firsthand.
我有亲身体会。

13
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.728
Before I ever turned 18,

00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:57.675
I spent approximately 400 days on Rikers Island,

15
00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:58.929
and to add to that
补充说明一下，

16
00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.783
I spent almost 300 days in solitary confinement,
这其中有差不多300天我是被单独监禁的。

17
00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:04.480
and let me tell you this:
让我告诉你们我每天都是怎么度过的：

18
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.588
Screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door
整天在门边大声尖叫，

19
00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:11.165
or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window,
或者对着窗外大声尖叫，

20
00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:13.087
it gets tiring.
你会感到疲倦。

21
00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:15.884
Since there's not much for you to do while you're in there,
因为在里面你没有什么事情可做，

22
00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.167
you start pacing back and forth in your cell,
你开始在监室里来回踱步，

23
00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.303
you start talking to yourself,
你开始自言自语，

24
00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:22.300
your thoughts start running wild,
你的思想开始狂奔，

25
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.783
and then your thoughts become your own worst enemy.
然后你的思想变成你最大的敌人。

26
00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:28.778
Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person,
监狱本来应该是改造一个人的地方，

27
00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.471
not cause him or her to become more angry,
而不是让人变得更愤怒、

28
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.211
frustrated, and feel more hopeless.
泄气和感到更绝望的地方。

29
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:38.114
Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people,
因为我们没有一个针对这些年轻人的出狱计划，

30
00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:41.709
they pretty much  reenter society with nothing.
所以当他们重返社会时几乎还是跟以前一个样。

31
00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:46.793
And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating.
而事实上他们也学不到什么东西能够防止他们再犯错误。

32
00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:49.825
But it all starts with the C.O.s.
但是一切都要从狱警说起。

33
00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:52.333
It's very easy for some people
对一些人来说，

34
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.027
to look at these correctional officers as the good guys
很容易就会将狱警视为好人，

35
00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:56.932
and the inmates as the bad guys,
将犯人视为坏人，

36
00:01:56.932 --> 00:01:58.868
or vice versa for some,
或者对另一些人来说则相反，

37
00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:00.669
but it's a little more than that.
但是事实却不止于此。

38
00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.664
See, these C.O.s are normal, everyday people.
其实这些狱警也不过是普通的市井小民。

39
00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:08.705
They come from the same neighborhoods as the population they "serve."
他们跟那些他们所“服务”的人来自相同的社区。

40
00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:11.417
They're just normal people.

41
00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:15.081
They're not robots, and there's  nothing special about them.
他们不是机器人，他们也没什么特别的。

42
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:18.843
They do pretty much everything anybody else in society does.
他们也会做社会上其他人做的事情。

43
00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:22.742
The male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s.
男狱警会想跟女狱警聊天和调情。

44
00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.551
They play the little high school kid games with each other.
他们互相玩着高中的孩子们玩的游戏。

45
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.455
They politic with one another.
他们也会彼此算计。

46
00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:31.774
And the female C.O.s gossip to each other.
而女狱警之间也会八卦。

47
00:02:31.774 --> 00:02:37.764
So I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s,
所以我花了大量的时间跟大数不清的狱警在一起，

48
00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:40.676
and let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe.
我尤其要给大家讲一讲一位叫Monroe的狱警。

49
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:43.174
One day he pulled me in between the A and B doors
一天他把我拉到两扇门之间，

50
00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:46.493
which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit.

51
00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:49.090
He pulled me there because I had a physical altercation
他把我拉到那边，是因为我与另一个年轻人

52
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.110
with another young man in my housing unit,
在我住的单间里发生了肢体冲突，

53
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.593
and he felt, since there was a female officer working on the floor,
因为有一个女狱警在这层工作，

54
00:02:54.593 --> 00:02:57.078
that I violated his shift.
他感觉我妨碍了他轮班。

55
00:02:56.688 --> 00:02:59.075
So he punched me in my chest.
所以他一拳打在我胸部。

56
00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.211
He kind of knocked the wind out of me.
他把我打得都有点眩晕了。

57
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.068
I wasn't impulsive, I didn't react right away,
我没有冲动，也没有立刻还击，

58
00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.716
because I know this is their house.
因为我知道这是他们的地盘。

59
00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:08.566
I have no wins.
我没有胜算。

60
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:13.994
All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately.
他只要拉响警报，后援就会立刻出现。

61
00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:17.465
So I just gave him a look in his eyes
所以我只是盯着他的眼睛，

62
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:20.724
and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning,
我想他看到了怒火和沮丧正在燃烧，

63
00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:22.689
and he said to me,
他对我说，

64
00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.151
"Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble,
“你的目光会让你惹不少麻烦，

65
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.657
because you're looking like you want to fight."
因为你看上去想要打架。”

66
00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.026
So he commenced to taking off his utility belt,
然后他开始脱下他的执勤腰带，

67
00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.117
he took off his shirt and his badge,

68
00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.154
and he said, "We could fight."
他说：“我们来打一架吧。”

69
00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:36.971
So I asked him, "You gonna hold it down?"
我问他：“你会保密？”

70
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.884
Now, that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island
那是在雷克岛监狱经常用到的一个短语，

71
00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:42.551
meaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody,
意思是，你不会和任何人讲，

72
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.778
and you're not going to report it.

73
00:03:44.778 --> 00:03:48.555
He said, "Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down?"
他说，“是的，我保密。你也要保密？”

74
00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.226
I didn't even respond.
我还没回话，

75
00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:52.151
I just punched him right in his face,
便直接一拳打他脸上，

76
00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.847
and we began fighting right then and there.
然后我们开始打得天翻地覆。

77
00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:59.167
Towards the end of the fight, he slammed me up against the wall,
在打架快结束的时候，他把我猛撞到墙上，

78
00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:02.482
so while we were tussled up, he said to me, "You good?"
我们已经扭打成了一团，他跟我说，“你还好吗？”

79
00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:04.437
as if he got the best of me,

80
00:04:04.437 --> 00:04:07.061

so I replied very cocky,

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:17.352
We let go, he shook my hand, said he gave me my respect,

85
00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:20.723
gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way.
给了我一支烟，并把我送回去了。

86
00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:25.284

不管你们信不信，在雷克岛监狱，你会遇到一些狱警，

87
00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:27.860
that'll fight you one-on-one.

They feel that they understand how it is,

90
00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:35.371
Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes,
因为这是你通常处理争议的方式，

91
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:37.450
we can handle it in that manner.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.724
I walk away from it like a man, you walk away from it like a man,

93
00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:42.145
and that's it.

Some C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you.
一些狱警认为他们是在跟你一起蹲班房。

95
00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:46.867

96
00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:48.898
and they go by that concept.

In some instances, we're in it together with the C.O.s.

on how to deal with  the mental health population as well.

for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case.
而且会持续很长时间，直到他们被释放。

104
00:05:11.264 --> 00:05:15.921

那么为什么不在这些年轻人坐牢的时候为他们提供一些指导？

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.142
Why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change,

they're doing something positive?

A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming.

00:05:33.446 --> 00:05:37.464
When I was on Rikers Island, the huge thing was solitary confinement.

110
00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:40.193

to break a person mentally, physically and emotionally.

当我在单独拘禁的时候，唯一使我保持心智健全的事就是读书。

When adolescents come to Rikers Island,

C74,RNDC就是他们住的地方。

127
00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:40.524
That's nicknamed "gladiator school,"
这地方有个别名，“格斗者学校”，

128
00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:43.406
because you have a young individual coming in from the street

feeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you

135
00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:03.554
But let's be honest:

136
00:07:03.554 --> 00:07:08.445
That culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people.

We need to help institutions and these teens realize

138
00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.694
that they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led
他们不必再过以前

139
00:07:14.694 --> 00:07:18.131
when they were on the street, that they can actually make a change.
在街上混的那种生活，他们可以改变。

140
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:21.582
It's sad to report that while I was in prison,
不过遗憾的是，在我坐牢的时候，

141
00:07:21.582 --> 00:07:25.811
I used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison,
我常常听到弟兄们讲，当他们被释放，

142
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.899
what type of crimes they're going to commit
回到街上混的时候，

143
00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.523
when they get back in the street.
他们要犯个什么案子。

144
00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:34.216
The conversations used to sound something like this:
对话通常听上去是这样的：

145
00:07:35.436 --> 00:07:38.263
"Oh, when I hit the street, my brother got this connection
“当我一回到街上，我兄弟们搞到这个关系，

146
00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:39.711
for this, that and the third,"
这个，那个，还有第三个。”

147
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:42.555
or, "My man over here got this connection for the low price.
或者，”我的人在那边搞到这个关系价格很低的，

148
00:07:42.555 --> 00:07:43.962
Let's exchange information,"
我们可以交换一下信息。”

149
00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:46.745
and, "When we hit the town, we're going to do it real big."
或者，”当我们一回到市里，我们要做单大的。“

150
00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:49.604
I used to hear these conversations and think to myself, "Wow,
我过去常常听这些对话，对自己说，“哇哦，

151
00:07:49.604 --> 00:07:52.536
these dudes are really talking about going back in the street

152
00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:53.928
and committing future crimes."

153
00:07:53.928 --> 00:07:55.640
So I came up with a name for that:
因此我想到一个称呼：

154
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.759
I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme
我称之为“快速再次蹲牢计划”，

155
00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.343
because really, how long is that going to last?
因为真的，这种行当到底能持续多久？

156
00:08:02.343 --> 00:08:04.703
You get a retirement plan with that?
会提供给你一个“退休方案”吗？

157

At the age of 21, I was in a maximum-security prison
