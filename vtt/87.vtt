tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society

8
00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:34.572
I remember when Facebook was just image-sharing in dorm rooms,
我记得当脸书还只是个 大学寝室发家的图片分享网站，

9
00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:36.795
and depending upon who you ask,

10
00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.150
it's now involved in toppling elections.

in the financial institutions in the world for automated trading,

00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:53.124
and they're now coming to quickly shape the way that we operate.
而它们现在正加速塑形着 我们的办事习惯。

16
00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:55.286
And I think each of you can recall that moment

17
00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:59.655
where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable, derisive thing,

18
00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.560
and suddenly, oh, crap, the price of Bitcoin is what it is.
但突然，它发展得 正似比特币价值般突飞猛进。

19
00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:05.526
Or, oh, crap, guess who's been elected.
你再想想，谁当选了美国总统？

20
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:10.398
The reality is that, you know, from my perspective,

21
00:01:10.422 --> 00:01:12.723
I think that we're about to encounter that again.

probably even to how we end up making an income,

not from space travel or biotech --

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.866
these are all very important future inventions --
虽然这些都是非常重要的科技，

29
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.334
but in the next five years,

I think it's going to come from video games.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.683
So that's a bold claim, OK.

32
00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:37.945
I see some skeptical faces in the audience.
我也看到了观众中质疑的脸。

33
00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.152
But if we take a moment

to try to look at what video games are already becoming in our lives today,

it starts to become more of an inevitability.

And I think the possibilities are quite electrifying.

39
00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:54.367
So let's just take a moment to think about scale.

40
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.192
I mean, there's already 2.6 billion people who play games.
现今已经有着26亿人玩电子游戏。

A billion more people in that time.

And there's likely to be a billion more

45
00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:11.284
when Africa and India gain the infrastructure

46
00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:13.797
to sort of fully realize the possibilities of gaming.

47
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:17.454
But what I find really special is -- and this often shocks a lot of people --
但我感到十分特别的是， 这常常会惊到他人，

48
00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:20.838
is that the average age of a gamer, like, have a guess, think about it.
是玩家的平均年龄。 你们猜一猜。

49
00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:23.384
It's not six, it's not 18, it's not 12.

50
00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:25.993
It's 34.

00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:30.763
And that tells us something,

54
00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:33.215
that this isn't entertainment for children anymore.
游戏不再是儿童的娱乐。

55
00:02:32.793 --> 00:02:35.477
This is already a medium like literature or anything else

56
00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:38.202
that's becoming a fundamental part of our lives.

57
00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:38.967
One stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming

58
00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:42.450
in the last sort of 15, 20 years
在过去十五到二十年中 开始打游戏的人们

59
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.916

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.754
Something changed in the way that this medium is organized.

00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:49.910
And more than that, it's not just play anymore, right?
这已经大于游戏本身， 人们不再仅仅是玩游戏了。

62
00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:51.588
You've heard some examples today,

64
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.700
And not in the obvious ways.

00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:57.549
Yes, there's e-sports, there's prizes,

66
00:02:57.573 --> 00:03:00.358
there's the opportunity to make money in a competitive way.
有很多机会可以让人们从竞赛中挣钱。

67

68
00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:05.429
doing art in them.
在游戏中做艺术， 通过这些得到薪酬。

69
00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:09.588
I mean, there's something at a scale akin to the Florentine Renaissance,
这种规模堪比佛罗伦萨文艺复兴，

70
00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:12.001
happening on your kid's iPhone in your living room.
而这一切可能就发生在你的客厅里 孩子正玩弄的iPhone中。

71
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.558
And it's being ignored.
它被很多人忽略了。

72
00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:17.127
Now, what's even more exciting for me is what's about to happen.

73
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.120

76
00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:23.112
but the truth is,

games have been deeply limited for a very long time

in a way that kind of we in the industry

79
00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:30.858
have tried very hard to cover up with as much trickery as possible.
一直努力用各种伎俩 把这一事实掩盖。

80
00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:33.931
The metaphor I like to use, if you'd let me geek out for a moment,
我喜欢用一个比喻， 让我变身极客稍许卖弄一下，

81
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.799
is the notion of a theater.
就是剧场的概念 。

82
00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:37.048
For the last 10 years,

games have massively advanced the visual effects,

the physical immersion, the front end of games.

85
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.826
But behind the scenes,
但在幕后，

86
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.834
the actual experiential reality of a game world

87
00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:49.730
has remained woefully limited.
仍然被限制。

88
00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:51.794
I'll put that in perspective for a moment.
我来解释一下。

89
00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:53.683
I could leave this theater right now,
我现在可以离开这个舞台。

90
00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:56.881
I could do some graffiti, get in a fight, fall in love.

91
00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:59.302
I might actually do all of those things after this,
我可能真的会在这演出之后 做这些事，

92
00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:01.656
but the point is that all of that would have consequence.
但是，这些事会有后果。

93
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.378
It would ripple through reality --

It would be persistent.

97
00:04:11.024 --> 00:04:12.588
Now, behind the scenes in games,

we've had a limit for a very long time.
我们很长一段时间都被限制了。

99
00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.326
And the limit is, behind the visuals,
在视觉效果背后，

100
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.287
the actual information being exchanged between players or entities
在单个游戏世界中

in a single game world

Even The World of Warcraft is actually thousands of smaller worlds.

106
00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:34.238
When you hear about concerts in Fortnite,

you're actually hearing about thousands of small concerts.

109
00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:41.029
campfires or couches.
无论是游戏里面的篝火 还是沙发。

110
00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:44.389
There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together.

111
00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:47.364
Let's take a moment to just really understand what that means.

112
00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:50.356
When you look at a game, you might see this, beautiful visuals,

all of these things happening in front of you.

114
00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:54.518
But behind the scenes in an online game,

115
00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:55.441
this is what it looks like.
看起来却是这样的。

116
00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:57.052
To a computer scientist,

120
00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:08.075
Well it's more that you've played on a treadmill.
其实，你仅仅只是在跑步机上前进。

121
00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.099
As you've been walking through that world,
在你探索游戏世界时，

122
00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:14.217
we've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you're not in to vanish,

that I promised you in the beginning of this talk.

126

127
00:05:22.694 --> 00:05:24.790
and might be excited about this,

133
00:05:36.258 --> 00:05:38.456
there are many others working on the problem --

134
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.283
I'd hardly take credit for it myself,

136
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:44.243
do this impossible hard thing

of weaving together thousands of disparate machines

138
00:05:47.307 --> 00:05:48.984
into single simulations

00:05:49.008 --> 00:05:51.477
that are convenient enough to not be one-offs,

140
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:53.142
but to be buildable by anybody.

141
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.350
And to be at the point

00:05:54.374 --> 00:05:57.724
where we can start to experience those things that we can't yet fathom.

Let's just take a moment to visualize that.
让我们想一下。

144
00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:02.823
I'm talking about not individual little simulations
