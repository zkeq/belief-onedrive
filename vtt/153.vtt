1
00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:15.138
So I'm a professional poker player,
我是一名专业扑克玩家，

2
00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:20.432
and today, I want to talk about three things that the game has taught me
今天，我想谈一谈牌局教给我的

3
00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:24.284
around decision-making that I find apply to everyday life.
可以应用于日常决策的三个决策。

4
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:27.672
Now the first of these things is about luck.
第一个就是运气。

5
00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:32.534
Now, like poker, life is also a game of skill and luck,
生活就像扑克游戏，需要技巧和运气，

6
00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:35.236
and when it comes to the biggest things we care about --
当面对我们最关心的事情——

7
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.037
health, wealth and relationships --
健康，财富，和人际关系——

8
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:41.895
these outcomes don't only depend on the quality of our decision-making,
其结果都不只跟我们做决定的质量有关，

9
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:43.664
but also the roll of life's dice.
也取决于生活中的运气。

10
00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:46.675
For example, we can be perfectly health-conscious
例如，我们在非常注重健康的情况下，

11
00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.069
and still get unlucky with something like cancer.
也仍然会不幸患上癌症。

12
00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:53.212
Or we can smoke 20 a day and live to a ripe old age,
或者一天抽20只烟，也能同样活到99，

13
00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:56.759
and this kind of ambiguity can make it hard for us to know
这种模糊性有时候让我们很难判断

14
00:00:56.783 --> 00:00:59.379
how good our strategies are, sometimes,
我们的策略究竟有多好，

15
00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:02.291
especially when we're experiencing a lot of success.
尤其在经历了多次成功之后。

16
00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.697
For example, back in 2010,
比如说，在2010年时，

17
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:08.705
I won a really big poker tournament known as the European Poker Tour.
我赢得了一场真正意义上的 扑克锦标赛，欧洲扑克巡回赛。

18
00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.071
And because I'd only been playing full-time for about a year,
再加上我当时仅仅全职玩了一年的扑克，

19
00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:14.990
when I won, I assumed I must be rather brilliant.
获胜之后，我觉得我一定非常聪明。

20
00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:17.768
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant
事实上，我觉得自己已经如此聪明了，

21
00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:21.236
that I not only got rather lazy with studying the game,
所以不仅懒得去钻研游戏，

22
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.910
but I also got more risky,
还开始变得喜欢冒险，

23
00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.942
started playing in the biggest tournaments I could
开始参加我能参加的最大的比赛，

24
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.481
against the very best in the world.
与最强大的对手对决。

25
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.997
And then my profit graph went from a thing of beauty
然后我的利润图表从让人赏心悦目，

26
00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:34.433
to something kind of sad,
变得有些惨不忍睹，

27
00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:36.751
with this worrying downhill trend for a long time,
并且这种令人担忧的 下行趋势持续了很长时间，

28
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:40.306
until I finally realized that I was overestimating my skill level,
直到我最终意识到，我高估了自己的水平，

29
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.821
and got my act together.
并开始重振旗鼓。

30
00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:44.862
And this kind of reminds me of what we've been seeing
这让我回想起了

31
00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:47.632
in the cryptocurrency space, at least in 2017,
在加密货币领域的见闻，至少在2017年，

32
00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:51.245
where the only thing that's been going up faster than the markets themselves
唯一比市场本身上升还快的

33
00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:53.746
is the number of "senior investment specialists"
就是不知道从哪里冒出来的

34
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.158
who have been appearing out of nowhere.
“高级投资专家”的数量。

35
00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.148
Now I'm not saying it's not possible to have a strategic edge,
我不是说不可能有战略优势，

36
00:01:59.172 --> 00:02:02.252
but at the same time, it's very easy to feel like a genius
但与此同时，当你在 一个快速上升的市场中，

37
00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:04.688
when you're in a market that's going up so fast
即便操着最烂的策略也能赚钱时，

38
00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:07.118
that even the worst strategies are making a profit.
是非常容易感觉自己天赋异禀的。

39
00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:09.541
So when we're experiencing success,
所以当我们在经历成功时，

40
00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:12.332
it's important to take a moment to really ask ourselves
应该花点时间扪心自问，

41
00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:14.988
how much of it is truly down to us,
这次成功中有多少因素 真正取决于我们的能力，

42
00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:19.504
because our egos love to downplay the luck factor when we're winning.
因为当我们获胜时，我们的自负感 会倾向于淡化运气成分。

43
00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.059
Now, a second thing poker taught me
第二件扑克教给我的事，

44
00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:26.426
is the importance of quantifying my thinking.
是量化自己想法的重要性。

45
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.349
When you're playing, you can't just get away with going,
当你在牌局上时，不可能就这样想着，

46
00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.122
"Eh, they're probably bluffing."
“呃，他们可能是在虚张声势。”

47
00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:33.300
That's just going to lose you a bunch of money,
这只会让你输很多钱，

48
00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:36.507
because poker is a game of probabilities and precision,
因为扑克是个关于概率和精确性的游戏，

49
00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:40.043
and so you have to train yourself to think in numbers.
所以你必须训练自己用数字思考。

50
00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:42.249
So now, whenever I catch myself
所以现在，每当我发现自己

51
00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:45.822
thinking vaguely about something really important, like,
在粗略地思考一些 非常重要的事情时，比如

52
00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:49.071
"It's unlikely I'll forget what I want to say in my TED Talk,"
“我大概不会在TED演讲时 忘记自己想要讲什么，”

53
00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:51.786
I now try to estimate it numerically.
我现在会尝试用数字估算它。

54
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.640
(Laughter)
（笑声）

55
00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:56.138
Trust me, it helps a lot with the planning process.
相信我，这真的对计划过程 有很大的帮助。

56
00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:59.166
And the thing is, almost anything that could possibly happen here today,
事实上，什么事情都有可能在今天

57
00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.161
or at any point in the future,
或在未来某个时候发生，

58
00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:03.481
can also be expressed as a probability, too.
也可以被表达为概率。

59
00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:06.868
(Laughter)
（笑声）

60
00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:10.297
So now I also try to speak in numbers as well.
我也会尝试把数据用到对话中。

61
00:03:10.321 --> 00:03:11.472
So if someone asks me,
如果有人问我，

62
00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:15.011
"Hey, Liv, do you think you're going to come along to that thing tonight?"
“嗨，丽芙，你今晚会参加么？”

63
00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:16.836
instead of just saying to them, "Yeah, probably,"
与其用“可能吧”这样的方式回复他们，

64
00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:18.918
I actually give them my best estimate --
我会给他们我最好的估计值——

65
00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:21.014
say, 60 percent.
比如，六成。

66
00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.197
Because -- I know that sounds a little odd --
虽然——我知道这听着奇怪——

67
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:26.293
but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitter
但关键在于，我在推特上对人们

68
00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:28.881
of what people understand the word "probably" to mean,
如何理解“可能吧”这句话做了个调研，

69
00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:30.653
and this was the spread of answers.
这是答案的分布情况。

70
00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:31.828
Enormous!
十分广泛！

71
00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:33.685
So apparently, it's absolutely useless
很明显，在传达任何重要的信息时，

72
00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.404
at actually conveying any real information.
这个表达是完全没用的。

73
00:03:36.428 --> 00:03:40.069
So if you guys catch yourselves using these vague words,
所以如果你们抓到自己在用

74
00:03:40.093 --> 00:03:42.989
like "probably" or "sometimes,"
像“大概”或者“有时候”的模糊词语时，

75
00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:46.196
try, instead, using numbers, because when we speak in numbers,
尝试让自己用数字， 因为我们用数字说话时，

76
00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:48.632
we know what lands in the other person's brain.
我们知道对方会如何理解。

77
00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:53.602
Now, the third thing I want to touch on today is intuition.
今天我要讲的第三点，是直觉。

78
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.746
How often have you seen these kinds of inspirational memes
多少人在Facebook上看到过那些

79
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.253
in your Facebook feed?
心灵鸡汤的图片？

80
00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:03.561
[Always trust your gut feeling and never second-guess.]
【始终相信你的直觉，不要怀疑自己。】

81
00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:04.846
They're nice, right?
挺正能量的，对吧？

82
00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:08.171
It's lovely. Yes. "Trust your soul."
真的挺不错的。没错，”相信你的灵魂。“

83
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.723
Well, they're terrible advice.
只不过它们都是差劲的建议。

84
00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:14.582
These are some of the best poker players in the world right now.
这些是世界上最厉害的扑克玩家。

85
00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:19.067
Do they look like people who live purely off feelings and intuitions?
他们看着像是完全活在 自己的感觉和直觉里的人吗？

86
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.092
(Laughter)
（笑声）

87
00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:21.765
Look at them!
看看他们！

88
00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.369
Obviously, these guys are about slow, careful analysis,
很明显，这些人凭借的 是缓慢，缜密的分析，

89
00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:28.900
and that's because the game has outgrown the days
因为现在的牌局已经不像当年，

90
00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:31.932
where pure street smarts and people-reading
靠着纯粹的草根智慧和看人能力

91
00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.777
can get you to the top.
就能让你到达顶峰。

92
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:37.103
And that's because our intuitions aren't nearly as perfect
这是因为我们的直觉 并没有我们想象中的

93
00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:38.397
as we'd like to believe.
那么完美。

94
00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:40.963
I mean, it'd be great, whenever we're in a tough spot,
当然了，如果每次深陷难处之时，

95
00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:44.993
to just have an answer appear to us from some magical source of inspiration.
都能灵光一现，让问题 迎刃而解，那就再好不过了。

96
00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:48.415
But in reality, our gut is extremely vulnerable
但现实中，我们的直觉极容易受到

97
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.874
to all kinds of wishful thinking and biases.
一厢情愿的想法和偏见的影响。

98
00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.924
So then, what is our gut good for?
那么，我们的直觉究竟擅长什么呢？

99
00:04:54.948 --> 00:04:57.020
Well, all the studies I've read
在我看过的所有研究中，

100
00:04:57.044 --> 00:05:00.991
conclude that it's best-suited for everyday things
都总结出了直觉最适合于那些

101
00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:03.368
that we have lots and lots of experience in,
我们有丰富经验的事情上，

102
00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.158
like how we just know that our friend is mad at us
比如我们在跟朋友沟通前，

103
00:05:06.182 --> 00:05:08.229
before we've even said anything to them,
就知道他们在生我们的气，

104
00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:11.405
or whether we can fit our car into a tight parking spot.
或者我们能不能把车停到 一个非常小的车位上。

105
00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.517
But when it comes to the really big stuff,
但在做重大决定时，

106
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:16.065
like what's our career path going to be
比如我们的职业规划

107
00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:17.771
or who should we marry,
或挑选结婚对象时，

108
00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:21.320
why should we assume that our intuitions
我们为什么要相信直觉会比

109
00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:25.046
are better calibrated for these than slow, proper analysis?
慢节奏，适当的分析 更适合处理这些问题呢？

110
00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:27.530
I mean, they don't have any data to be based off.
我意思是，直觉没有任何数据来支撑。

111
00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:32.126
So my third lesson is, while we shouldn't ignore our intuitions,
所以我学到的第三件事就是： 我们不应该忽视我们的直觉，

112
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.523
we shouldn't overprivilege them either.
但也不应该过分重视它们。

113
00:05:34.547 --> 00:05:36.975
And I'd like to summarize these three lessons today
我现在想要

114
00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.627
with my own set of memes,
从一名扑克玩家的角度

115
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.706
with more of a poker-player twist.
来总结一下这三个经验。

116
00:05:41.777 --> 00:05:45.912
"Success is sweetest when you achieve it across a large sample size."
“通过大样本量获得的成功才是最甜美的。”

117
00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:47.674
(Laughter)
（笑声）

118
00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:52.118
"Your gut is your friend and so is a cost-benefit analysis.
”直觉是你的朋友，成本效益分析也同样。”

119
00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:53.375
(Laughter)
（笑声）

120
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:58.042
"The future is unknown, but you can damn well try and estimate it."
”未来是未知的，但是你可以 努力的尝试并且评估它。“

121
00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.217
Thank you.
谢谢。

122
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:05.907
(Applause)
（掌声）
