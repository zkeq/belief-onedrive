I just could not do it.
我就是做不下去。

78
00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:26.496
Every single time, it would take me back to my childhood,
每一次， 这都让我想起我小时候，

79
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.341
when I had a much harder time speaking.

I've stuttered for as long as I can remember.

If it was for me, my parents would say I'm not around.

88
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:54.012
And I hated introducing myself,

89
00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:55.645
especially in groups.

90
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.045
I'd always stutter on my name, and there was usually someone who'd go,

I spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke,

So I mostly stayed quiet.

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:27.725
And so you see, eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work

100
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:29.322
was a huge step for me.

101
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.407
Every time I record audio,
每当我录音的时候，

102
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:34.926
I fumble my way through saying each sentence many, many times,

103
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.584
and then I go back in

and pick the ones where I think I suck the least.

105
00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.896
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.
（画外音）萨：音频剪辑就像 给你的声音Photoshop一样。

106
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.731
I can slow it down, speed it up, make it deeper, add an echo.
我给它减速、加速， 让它变得深沉、加上回音。

107
00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:53.502
And if I stutter along the way, and if I stutter along the way,

108
00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.145
I just go back in and fix it.

109
00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.564
It's magic.

110
00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.493
SS: Using my highly edited voice in my work
萨：将经过大幅度修饰的声音 用到我的视频里，

111
00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:03.072
was a way for me to finally sound normal to myself.
才能让我觉得自己的声音正常了一些。

112
00:05:04.122 --> 00:05:06.267
But after the comments on the video,
不过自从看了那些评论，

113
00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:08.749
it no longer made me feel normal.
这也不能让我觉得正常了。

114
00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:12.090
And so I stopped using my voice in my work.
于是我不再把自己的声音用到视频里。

115
00:05:13.804 --> 00:05:17.570
Since then, I've thought a lot about what it means to be normal.
在那之后，我想了很多 人们所谓的“正常”到底是什么？

116
00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:21.056
And I've come to understand
后来我开始理解了，

117
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.459
that "normal" has a lot to do with expectations.
所谓的“正常” 与人们的期待值有关。

118
00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:26.656
Let me give you an example.
举个例子吧，

119
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.010
I came across this story
我想到一个故事，

120
00:05:28.034 --> 00:05:30.300
about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.
是关于古希腊作家荷马的。

121
00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:33.573
Now, Homer mentions very few colors in his writing.
在荷马的作品里 只提到了非常少的几种颜色。

122
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.075
And even when he does,
即使在描写颜色的时候，

123
00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.137
he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.
荷马笔下的颜色 也和现代人的常识不尽相同。

124
00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:42.048
For example, the sea is described as wine red,
比如说，荷马说海是酒红色的，

125
00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:45.619
people's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple.
人的脸有时是绿色的， 而绵羊则是紫色的。

126
00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:48.033
But it's not just Homer.
这种现象不单单出现在荷马的作品里。

127
00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:50.366
If you look at all of the ancient literature --
在世界古典文学中——

128
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.590
Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian
古代中国、冰岛、希腊、印度的文学

129
00:05:52.614 --> 00:05:55.291
and even the original Hebrew Bible --
甚至是在希伯来圣经中

130
00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:57.891
they all mention very few colors.
提到的颜色都很少。

131
00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:01.945
And the most popular theory for why that might be the case
对这种现象最出名的解释是：

132
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.373
is that cultures begin to recognize a color
一个文明首先要能生产出一种颜色，

133
00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.482
only once they have the ability to make that color.
然后才能识别出这种颜色。

134
00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:09.356
So basically, if you can make a color,
简单的说，你只有先制造出一种颜色，

135
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.006
only then can you see it.
才能“看见”这种颜色。

136
00:06:11.547 --> 00:06:15.206
A color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make --
像红色这种比较方便制造的颜色

137
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.061
they began to see that color fairly early on.
就能比较早的出现在各大文明的认知中。

138
00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:20.828
But a color like blue, which was much harder to make --
然而像蓝色这种 不那么方便制作的颜色，

139
00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:23.605
many cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color
很多文明都花了相当长的时间

140
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:24.795
until much later.
才最终制造出了蓝色。

141
00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.335
They didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
于是他们也花了相当长的时间 来最终“看见”蓝色。

142
00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:31.009
So until then, even though a color might be all around them,
在一个颜色被制造出来之前 就算它随处可见，

143
00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:33.478
they simply did not have the ability to see it.
人们也对它视而不见。

144
00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:34.660
It was invisIble.
就好像这种颜色是隐形的一样。

145
00:06:34.684 --> 00:06:37.064
It was not a part of their normal.
这种颜色不在人们 “正常”的认知范畴里。

146
00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:41.315
And that story has helped put my own experience into context.
这个说法和我的自身经历很契合。

147
00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:44.666
So when I first read the comments on the video,
当我第一次看到那些评论时，

148
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.585
my initial reaction was to take it all very personally.
我的第一反应是 那些评论都是针对我的。

149
00:06:48.363 --> 00:06:50.261
But the people commenting did not know
不过事实上 那些评论者并不知道，

150
00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:53.145
how self-conscious I am about my voice.
我对自己的声音那么在意。

151
00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:56.725
They were mostly reacting to my accent,
他们的评论都是关于我的口音。

152
00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.266
that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent.
他们认为一个带口音的配音者 是不常见的、不正常的。

153
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:02.412
But what is normal, anyway?
不过话说回来，什么才算正常？

154
00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:06.655
We know that reviewers will find more spelling errors in your writing
评论家会在你的作品里 挑出很多拼写错误，

155
00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:08.050
if they think you're black.
仅仅因为他以为你是个黑人。

156
00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:13.256
We know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students.
教授会不那么情愿去辅导 女学生、或者少数族裔学生。

157
00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.816
And we know that resumes with white-sounding names
一份有着看起来 像是白人名字的简历，

158
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.733
get more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names.
比起写着黑人名字的简历 要有更高的通过率。

159
00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:22.061
Why is that?
为什么会这样？

160
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:25.274
Because of our expectations of what is normal.
这都是因为我们对常识的刻板印象。

161
00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:27.534
We think it is normal
常识告诉我们，

162
00:07:27.558 --> 00:07:29.663
when a black student has spelling errors.
黑人学生往往会有拼写错误。

163
00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:31.799
We think it is normal
常识告诉我们，

164
00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:35.015
when a female or minority student does not succeed.
女学生和少数族裔学生 往往在学术领域少有建树。

165
00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:37.421
And we think it is normal
常识告诉我们，

166
00:07:37.445 --> 00:07:40.531
that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee.
一个白人员工往往要比黑人员工好。

167
00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:43.813
But studies also show that discrimination of this kind,
但是研究表明， 像这一类的区别判断，

168
00:07:43.837 --> 00:07:45.882
in most cases, is simply favoritism,
通常只是偏见而无事实依据。

169
00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:49.424
and it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to
而这种偏见让我们倾向于去帮助同类，

170
00:07:50.313 --> 00:07:53.510
than the desire to harm people that you can't relate to.
而伤害异类。

171
00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:57.971
And not relating to people starts at a very early age.
人类在很小的时候 就开始区分同类与异类。

172
00:07:57.995 --> 00:07:59.375
Let me give you an example.
举个例子，

173
00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:03.318
One library that keeps track of characters
有一个图书馆把每年出版的 儿童故事书

174
00:08:03.342 --> 00:08:06.635
in the children's book collection every year,
里面的角色都记录了下来。

175
00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:11.940
found that in 2014, only about 11 percent of the books
他们发现， 在2014年 只有11%的角色

176
00:08:11.964 --> 00:08:14.164
had a character of color.
是有色人种。

177
00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:17.865
And just the year before, that number was about eight percent,
而这个数值在2013年 只有8%。

178
00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.697
even though half of American children today come from a minority background.
可事实上，有一半的美国儿童 都是少数族裔。

179
00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:22.871
Half.
50%啊。

180
00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:24.797
So there are two big issues here.
这就导致了两个问题，

181
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:27.478
Number one, children are told that they can be anything,
第一，我们一方面告诉孩子们 他们可以成为任何人，

182
00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:28.653
they can do anything,
他们有能做任何事的潜力，

183
00:08:28.677 --> 00:08:31.150
and yet, most stories that children of color consume
然而另一方面 少数族裔的孩子们，

184
00:08:31.174 --> 00:08:33.052
are about people who are not like them.
看到的故事 却都是关于其他人的。

185
00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.835
Number two is that majority groups don't get to realize
第二，多数族裔的人没有意识到

186
00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:38.892
the great extent to which they are similar to minorities --
他们其实与少数族裔的人 有很多相似之处——

187
00:08:38.916 --> 00:08:41.963
our everyday experiences, our hopes,
我们的日常生活，我们的期待，

188
00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.859
our dreams, our fears
我们的梦想，我们的恐惧， 都是相似的。

189
00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.656
and our mutual love for hummus.
甚至我们对鹰嘴豆泥的喜好 也是一样的，

190
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.989
It's delicious!
真的很好吃嘛！

191
00:08:47.013 --> 00:08:48.720
(Laughter)
（笑声）

192
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:52.414
Just like the color blue for Ancient Greeks,
就像蓝色之于古希腊人，

193
00:08:52.438 --> 00:08:55.759
minorities are not a part of what we consider normal,
少数族裔之于我们的社会而言 也不在“正常”的范畴之内。

194
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.221
because normal is simply a construction of what we've been exposed to,
因为我们对“正常”的界定 形成于日常生活之中，

195
00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:04.034
and how visible it is around us.
取决于我们的见识，

196
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.542
And this is where things get a bit difficult.
这就是症结所在。

197
00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:12.814
I can accept the preexisting notion of normal -- that normal is good,
我可以选择认可所谓的“正常” 所有在正常范畴内的都是好的，

198
00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:16.853
and anything outside of that very narrow definition of normal is bad.
而在“正常”这个狭隘的定义之外 一切都是不好的。

199
00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:21.424
Or I can challenge that preexisting notion of normal
我也可以选择挑战 所谓的“正常”，

200
00:09:22.282 --> 00:09:23.455
with my work
就凭着我的作品，

201
00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:25.130
and with my voice
我的声音，

202
00:09:26.158 --> 00:09:27.581
and with my accent
还有我的口音，

203
00:09:28.452 --> 00:09:29.968
and by standing here onstage,
以及我现在的演讲。

204
00:09:29.992 --> 00:09:33.315
even though I'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom.
尽管我现在紧张得要死， 恨不得马上躲进洗手间里。

205
00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:34.656
(Laughter)
（笑声）

206
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.497
(Applause)
（掌声）

207
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:48.292
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice): I'm now slowly starting to use my voice
（视频）绵羊（萨配音）： 现在我又逐渐开始用自己的声音

208
00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:49.470
in my work again.

209
00:09:49.494 --> 00:09:50.645
And it feels good.
这感觉真好。

210
00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:52.637
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown
这不是说我的声音完美无缺了，

211
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:55.128
the next time a couple dozen people say that I talk

212
00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:57.460
(Mumbling) like I have peanut butter in my mouth.
（含糊不清地）好像含了花生酱 在嘴里一样，

213
00:09:57.484 --> 00:09:58.486
(Laughter)
（笑声）

214
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.190
SS: It just means I now have a much better understanding
萨：而是说我现在 更加清楚

215
00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:02.958
of what's at stake,
什么是至关重要的，

216
00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:05.482
and how giving up is not an option.
以及放弃 并不是一种选择。

217
00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:11.225
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up one day and realize

218
00:10:11.249 --> 00:10:12.574
that the sky was blue.

219
00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:16.455
It took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring

220
00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:17.648
for so long.
那些曾经被忽略了很久的事物。

221
00:10:18.713 --> 00:10:22.534
And so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal,
所以我们必须要经常挑战 我们对“正常”的界定。

222
00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:26.890
because doing so is going to allow us as a society

to finally see the sky for what it is.
