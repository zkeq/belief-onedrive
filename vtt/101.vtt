1
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.570
Let me tell you about rock snot.
让我来解释一下什么是岩石鼻涕。

2
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.436
Since 1992, Dr. Max Bothwell,
自1992年以来，麦克斯 · 博斯维尔 博士（Dr. Max Bothwell），

3
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.476
a Government of Canada scientist,
一位加拿大的科学家，

4
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.436
has been studying a type of algae that grows on rocks.
一直在研究一种 生长于岩石上的藻类。

5
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.036
Now, the very unscientific term for that algae is rock snot,
这种藻类俗称岩石鼻涕，

6
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.476
because as you can imagine,
因为正如你所想的那样，

7
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.180
it looks a lot like snot.
它看起来非常像鼻涕。

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.556
But scientists also call it Didymosphenia geminata
但科学家也称之为双生双楔藻。

9
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.916
and for decades, this algae has been sliming up riverbeds
数十年来，该藻类不断使全世界的河床

10
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.076
around the world.
变得越来越薄。

11
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.636
The problem with this algae
这一藻类带来的问题是，

12
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.556
is that it is a threat to salmon, to trout
它会对三文鱼、鳟鱼造成威胁，

13
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.236
and the river ecosystems it invades.
甚至破坏河流的生态系统。

14
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.476
Now, it turns out Canada's Dr. Bothwell
不得不承认，加拿大的博斯维尔博士，

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.676
is actually a world expert in the field,
的确是这方面的专家，

16
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.876
so it was no surprise in 2014
所以在2014年，

17
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.356
when a reporter contacted Dr. Bothwell
记者联系博斯维尔博士 询问该藻类的信息，

18
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.900
for a story on the algae.
就非常合理了。

19
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.356
The problem was, Dr. Bothwell wasn't allowed to speak to the reporter,
不过博斯维尔博士并不能 给记者透露任何消息。

20
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.116
because the government of the day wouldn't let him.
原因是当权政府不允许他这样做。

21
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.556
110 pages of emails
110页的电子邮件

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.516
and 16 government communication experts

23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.700
stood in Dr. Bothwell's way.
都在阻止博斯维尔博士。

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.876
Why couldn't Dr. Bothwell speak?
为什么博斯维尔博士不能谈论它呢？

25
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.716
Well, we'll never know for sure,
我们也许无从得知，

26
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.476
but Dr. Bothwell's research did suggest
但博斯维尔博士的研究确实表明

27
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.356
that climate change may have been responsible
气候变化也许是导致

28
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.900
for the aggressive algae blooms.
岩石鼻涕爆发式增长的原因。

29
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.740
But who the heck would want to stifle climate change information, right?
但到底是谁想切断气候变化 相关消息的外泄渠道呢？

30
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.876
Yes, you can laugh.
是的，你可以笑。

31
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.796
It's a joke,
这是个玩笑，

32
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.660
because it is laughable.
因为的确可笑。

33
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.996
We know that climate change is suppressed for all sorts of reasons.
我们知道，不论出于什么原因， 气候变化都应得到控制。

34
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.276
I saw it firsthand when I was a university professor.
以前在大学任教的时候，曾亲身参与其中。

35
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.836
We see it when countries pull out of international climate agreements
我们见证了许多国家共同 签署的国际气候协议，

36
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.996
like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Accord,
如京都议定书、巴黎协定，

37
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.220
and we see it when industry fails to meet its emissions reduction targets.
我们同时也发现，公司企业并没有 完成自身节能减排的目标。

38
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.516
But it's not just climate change information that's being stifled.
但并不只是气候变化的信息被压下来。

39
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.196
So many other scientific issues are obscured by alternate facts,
太多其他的科学问题也被不同的说法，

40
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.996
fake news and other forms of suppression.
假新闻和其他形式的压制所掩盖。

41
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.236
We've seen it in the United Kingdom,

42
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.196
we've seen it in Russia,

45
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.300
right here in Canada.
在加拿大，就在这里，也出现了。

50
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.676

51
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.996
free to collaborate with other scientists,

to present uncomfortable or inconvenient truths,
表达令人不快或是难以面对的真相，

65
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.036
because that's how scientists push boundaries

66
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.075
and pushing boundaries is, after all, what science is all about.
毕竟，不断超越就是科学的全部。

67
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.196
And here's another point:

68
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.676
scientists must be free to fail,

because even a failed hypothesis teaches us something.
因为即使不成立的假设 也会使我们从中获益。

And the best way I can explain that is through one of my own adventures.

71
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.740
But first I've got to take you back in time.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.276
It's the early 1900s

when I first heard those shocking facts

90
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.076
My curiosity would lead me to a frozen land

94
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.996

我们希望冰封的土地 可以同时保存尸体和病毒。

107
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.996
Now, I know what you are all waiting for,

145
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.036
So I did what anyone appalled by politics would do:
