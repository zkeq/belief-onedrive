00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.316
I'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word,
我来这里是为了和你们分享一个并不起眼，却很有力量的词，

2
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.180
one that people will do almost anything to avoid becoming.
人们为了避免它，甚至愿意做任何事。

3
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.156
Billion-dollar industries thrive because of the fear of it,

4
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.356
and those of us who undeniably are it

5
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.940
are left to navigate a relentless storm surrounding it.

I'm not sure if any of you have noticed,

8
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.396
Not the lowercase, muttered-behind-my-back kind,

9
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.796
or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly.
也不是那种看起来无害的乖胖，

10
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.420
I'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind.

11
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.516
Let's not sugarcoat it.

I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.

I am the elephant in the room.

some of you may have been thinking,

"Aww, this is going to be hilarious,

(Laughter)
（笑声）

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.395
Or you may have been thinking, "Where does she get her confidence from?"
你们也会想，“她这是哪里来的自信呀？”

20
00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:19.740
Because a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable.

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.836
The fashion-conscious members of the audience

Whereas some of you might have thought,

28

You may have wondered, consciously or not,

if I have diabetes, or a partner,

35

36
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.996
They can be directed at individuals and groups,
他们可能产生于个人，也可能产生于集体，

37
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.580
and they can also be directed at ourselves.

38
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.380
And this way of thinking is known as fatphobia.

39
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.036
Like any form of systematic oppression,

fatphobia is deeply rooted in complex structures

like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,

43
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.900
let alone challenge.
更不用说要改变它了。

where being fat is seen as being a bad person --

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.780
lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible

in the media, in public health policy, doctors' offices,

in everyday conversations and in our own attitudes.

for the discrimination they face
责备那些肥胖的人，

58
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.260
Easy.

This antifat bias has become so integral, so ingrained

60
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.236
to how we value ourselves and each other

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.996
that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size

if they don't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable?

So when I was six years old,

76
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.660
not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me.

77
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.676
I was determined not to be excluded from the performance,

claiming space for myself in that glorious fourfour

was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist.

Now, I'm not saying that this whole body-love thing

has been an easy skip along a glittering path of self-acceptance

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.940
Far from it.

than a number on an outdated BMI chart.

My way of engaging in activism
