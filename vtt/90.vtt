1
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.820
So how would you run a whole country without oil?
怎么让一个国家在没有用石油的情况下运转？

2
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820
That's the question that sort of hit me
那个问题突然浮现在我的脑海

3
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.
四年以前在Davos的一个下午。

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820
It never left my brain.
我永远不会忘记它。

5
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.820
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.
我越想越多，就像一个游戏。

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.
一开始我想一定应该用乙醇。

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
So I went out and researched ethanol,
所以我便开始学习研究乙醇。

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.820
and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.
然后发现，每个国家必须得有个自己的亚马孙来支持。

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,
六个月以后，我觉得答案必定是氢气，

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,
直到后来某科学家告诉我一个不幸的事实：

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
which is, you actually use more
你其实用了

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.820
clean electrons than the ones you get
比你所得到的更多干净的电子，

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
inside a car, if you use hydrogen.
如果在汽车里使用氢气的话。

14
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
So that is not going to be the path to go.
所以这并不是一个可行的办法。

15
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820
And then sort of through a process of
然后经过反反复复的思考，

16
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
wandering around, I got to the thought
我有了这样一个想法，

17
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,
如果你可以将整个国家转换到使用电力汽车，

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
in a way that is convenient and affordable,
在方便和经济的前提下，

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
you could get to a solution.
那你便有了解决的方法。

20
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
Now I started this from a point of view that
我从一开始觉得

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820
it has to be something that scales en masse.
我们的办法只能在一个很大的范围内可行。

22
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820
Not how do you build one car,
这并不是怎么制造一辆车，

23
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820
but how do you scale this so that it can become
而是，怎么设计一个方案

24
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.820
something that is used by 99 percent of the population?
可以让百分之99的人都使用这种汽车。

25
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good
第一个想法便是这种车必须跟现在的车

26
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.820
as any car that you would have today.
一样好用。

27
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.
因此，第一：它必须比一辆汽车方便。

28
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.
第二：它必须比现代的汽车便宜。

29
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.820
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?
便宜的意思不是指一辆4万美元的轿车。

30
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.
对吧？那可不是我们今天可以购买的汽车。

31
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.820
And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.
并且，方便的意思不是说你得充电8小时却只能开1小时。

32
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
So we're bound with the laws of physics
所以我们需要遵循物理原理

33
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.820
and the laws of economics.
以及经济原理。

34
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
And so the thought that I started with was
于是我开始问这样一个问题：

35
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
how do you do this, still within the boundary
我们应该如何在现有的

36
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.820
of the science we know today --
科学限定范围内实现这个理想，

37
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things
要知道，我们并没有科学展览以及尝试各种试验的时间

38
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.820
or waiting for the magic battery to show up.
更没有等待神奇电池诞生的时间。

39
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820
How do you do it within the economics that we have today?
那我们应该怎么在现有经济条件之下实现这个目标？

40
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.820
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?
我们应该怎么从消费者动力处着手？

41
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
And not from the power of an edict down.
而不是从硬性法令限制处着手。

42
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.820
On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,
在某个去Tesla参观的下午，

43
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.820
I actually found out that the answer comes
我突然意识到这些问题的答案来自

44
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.820
from separating between the car ownership
汽车拥有权以及

45
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.820
and the battery ownership.
电池拥有权的分离。

46
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.820
In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic
在某种程度上，你会觉得这是经典的

47
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.820
"batteries not included."
“不包含电池”。

48
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820
Now if you separate between the two,
如果现在你将这两者分离，

49
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.820
you could actually answer the need for a convenient car
你便有了如何解决节能车需求的答案－

50
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820
by creating a network,
通过创造一个网络，

51
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.820
by creating a network before the cars show up.
在汽车出现之前，创造一个网络。

52
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.820
The network has two components in them.
这个网络由两个部分组成。

53
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.820
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --
第一个部分是每当你停车的时候，你让汽车充电－－

54
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.820
ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive
结果这些汽车变成了只会行驶两个小时

55
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.820
for about two hours and park for about 22 hours.
而要充电12个小时的机器。

56
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.820
If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon
如果你驾驶汽车早上出门，下午回程

57
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.820
the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.
这样的话，充电与驾驶的比例是1分钟比一分钟。

58
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.820
And so the first thought that came to mind is,
由此产生的第一个想法是，

59
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.820
everywhere we park we have electric power.
任何我们停车的地方都会有电力。

60
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,
这听上去可能有点不可思议。 但是，在世界某个角落，

61
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.820
like Scandinavia, you already have that.
像北欧，这个设置已经存在。

62
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,
如果你把车停了，不把暖气开着，

63
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.820
when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.
当你回来的时候，车一定开不了。

64
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.820
Now that last mile,
现在想想这最后一英里，

65
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.820
last foot, in a sense,
最后一步，在某种意义上，

66
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.820
is the first step of the infrastructure.
是迈向基础设施的第一步。

67
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care
基础设施的第二步便是解决

68
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
of the range extension.
扩大范围的需要。

69
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.820
See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,
我们被现有的电池技术限制，

70
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820
which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within
在适当的空间和重量限制范围之内，

71
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.820
reasonable space and weight limitations.
汽车只能行驶大概120英里左右。

72
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.820
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.
对大部分人来说，120英里已经是一个足够的范围。

73
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.820
But you never want to get stuck.
可是，没有人愿意被现有的限制束缚。

74
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.820
So what we added is a second element to our network,
因此，我们为我们的网络添加了第二个成分

75
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820
which is a battery swap system.
这便是一个电池交换系统。

76
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.820
You drive. You take your depleted battery out.
你驾驶。 你把已耗尽的电池取出。

77
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.820
A full battery comes on. And you drive on.
换上一个全新的电池，你继续你的旅程。

78
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.820
You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.
这并不是体力劳动。这是全自动模式。

79
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.820
It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.
这跟自动洗车一样。 你把车开入自动洗车系统，

80
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.820
And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and
一个钢板将你的电池取出，换进一个新的电池。

81
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.820
within two minutes you're back on the road
两分种之内，你便可以上路，

82
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.820
and you can go again.
继续你的旅程。

83
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.820
If you had charge spots everywhere,
如果任何地方都有充电站，

84
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.820
and you had battery swap stations everywhere,
任何地方都有电池替换系统，

85
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.820
how often would you do it? And it ends up
你会多久换一次电池，充一次电？ 其实这样下来

86
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.820
that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.
你换电池的频率比你加油的频率要低。

87
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.820
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.
我们甚至把这个事实加入到我们的合同里。

88
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.820
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year
我们规定如果你一年停车替换电池多于50次，

89
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.820
we start paying you money
我们会补偿你，

90
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820
because it's an inconvenience.
因为这样停车换电池非常不方便。

91
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.820
Then we looked at the question of the affordability.
然后我们审查了消费者能否负担的问题。

92
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.820
We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is
当电池与汽车分离，

93
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.820
disconnected from the car.
不再是车的一部分会怎么样呢。

94
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820
What is the cost of that battery?
电池究竟是花多少钱？

95
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.820
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
别人都告诉我们电池很贵。

96
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.820
What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,
我们发现，当你从分子过渡到电子，

97
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.820
something interesting happens.
有趣的事情便由此产生了。

98
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.820
We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.
我们再回到最原有的汽车经济原理，重新考量。

99
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.820
The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.
电池，在某种程度上，跟油箱不一样。

100
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.
还记得你的汽车里有一个油箱。

101
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.820
You have the crude oil.
你有原油。

102
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820
And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil
把原油加工，运输，

103
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.820
as what we call petrol or gasoline.
便成了我们现有的汽油。

104
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.820
The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.
电池，从这个角度看，就像原油。

105
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.820
We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars
我们有电池海湾。 费用大概是几百美元，

106
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.820
as the gas tank.
跟油箱一样。

107
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.820
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.
但是原油被电池取代。

108
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.820
Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself
电池不会燃烧。 它只会耗损自己

109
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.820
step after step after step.
一步接一步。

110
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.820
It has 2,000 life cycles these days.
现有电池有大概2000个寿命循环。

111
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.820
And so it's sort of a mini well.
就像一个小型的油井。

112
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.820
We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car
过往当我们决定买一辆电力车，

113
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820
to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.
我们必须付那口井的全部费用。

114
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.820
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.
买车的时候， 没有任何人想购入一口小型井。

115
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.820
In a sense what we've done is
在某种程度上，我们创造了

116
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820
we've created a new consumable.
一个新的消费品。

117
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.820
You, today, buy gasoline miles.
你们，今天，买汽油英里。

118
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.820
And we created electric miles.
而我们却创造了电力英里。

119
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.820
And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.
电力英里的价钱非常有意思。

120
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.820
Today 2010, in volume,
在2010年的今天， 按数量计算，

121
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.820
when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.
我们今天进入市场，价钱是8美分一英里。

122
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.820
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --
那些对这个概念有点模糊的观众，

123
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.820
in the average consumer
在平均消费

124
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.820
environment we're in in the U.S.
环境下，在美国

125
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.820
20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.
一加仑20英里大概是1.50， 1.60一加仑。

126
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.820
That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.
这比现在的油价要便宜多了，甚至在美国。

127
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.820
In Europe where taxes are in place,
在税收严谨的欧洲，

128
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.820
that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.
这就等于－60美元一桶原油。

129
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.820
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.
可是电力英里跟随摩尔定律。

130
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.820
They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,
在2010年，它们从8美分一英里，

131
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.820
to four cents a mile in 2015,
到2015年4美分一英里，

132
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.820
to two cents a mile by 2020.
到2020年2美分一英里。

133
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.820
Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --
为什么？因为电池寿命循环不断提升－

134
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.820
a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.
能源密集的进步会导致价钱下调。

135
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.820
And these prices are actually with clean electrons.
而且这些价钱都是在使用无污染电子的基础上产生的。

136
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.820
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.
我们不会使用任何来自煤炭的电子。

137
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.820
So in a sense this is
所以，在某种意义上，这是

138
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.820
an absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel
一个绝对无碳，无矿物燃料，

139
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.820
electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.
的电力英里，价钱在2020将是2美分一英里。

140
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.820

144
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.820
An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific

would convert to crude oil,

they still can't compete with two cents a mile.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.820
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.
我于是退出了SAP CEO的竞选，开始了这个名为“更美好的地方”的案子。

192
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.820
We then decided to scale it up.

We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.

因此如果你在丹麦想购买一辆汽油汽车，价钱大概是6万欧元左右。

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.820
(Laughter)

209
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.820
If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,

we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,

was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.

In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have

the highest concentration of Priuses,

you're dead. Alright?

lots of other curves that we've seen,

242
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.820
goes along a depletion curve.
沿着一个耗尽曲线发展。

243
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.820
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.
这个曲线建立在我们逐渐失去接近地下的油井的基础上。

244
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.820
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.
然后我们便不停的开发离地下越来越远的油井。

245
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.820
It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.
这样的油井最后变得越来越贵去开发。

You think, well it's been up, it's been down,
你想想，油价上涨过，下调过，

再上涨过，而且会一直上下变动。

248
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820
Here is the problem:

at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,
六个月前，原油价高立在147美元一桶，

250
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.820
the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.
美国购买石油，花费不少。

251
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.820
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --
然后美国经济崩溃，原油价下调到47美元一桶。

252

sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.

What happens when the economy recovers?

在2015年前，我们至少将有2.5亿辆新车

even at the pace we're going at right now.
就算我们按现有的汽车增加率计算。

260
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.820
That's another 30 percent demand on oil.
那意味着原油需求将上涨百分之30。

261
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.820
That is another 25 million barrels a day.

That's all the U.S. usage today.
即美国现在的原油消耗量。

263

In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.
这就是说当我们经济复苏时，我们将到达原油需求的高峰点。

264
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.820
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package
然后我们来实行OPEC刺激计划，

also known as 200 dollars a barrel.

We take our money and we give it away.

267
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.820
You know what happens at that point?

268
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.820
We go back down. It's going to go up and down.
我们的经济会下调。 它会一直不断上下浮动。

and the ups are going to be much shorter.

272
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.820
like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,

275
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.820
which oscillate, and they oscillate until
这种资源一直变动，直到

276
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.820
we lose everything we've got.
我们完全用尽这种资源。

277
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.820
Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.
其实我们查看了这个问题的答案。

278
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.820
Right? Remember in the campaign: one million
对吗？还记得那个广告宣传，一百万

279
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.820
hybrid cars by 2015.
混合动力车，到2015年

280
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.820
That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.
那可是百分之0.5的美国耗油量。

281
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.820
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.
那只是世界耗油量微不足道的一部分。

282
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.820
That won't do much difference.
那样做没有什么意义。

283
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.820
We looked at an MIT study:
我们查看了一个麻省理工大学的研究：

284
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.820
ten million electric cars on the global roads.
一千万电力汽车投放国际市场。

285
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.820
Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.
这是我们计划投入的5亿辆电力汽车中的一千万。

286
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.820
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.
那可是你所可以拥有的最保守的数量。

287
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820
It's also the most optimistic number
同时也是最乐观的一个数字，

288
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.820
because it means we will scale this industry
因为这意味这我们将扩大这个行业

289
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.820
from 100 thousand cars is 2011,
从2011年的10万辆，

290
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.820
to 10 million cars by 2016 --
到2016年的1千万辆。

291
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.820
100 x growth in less than five years.
这意味着不到5年内10倍的增长。

292
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.820
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.
同时你必须记得现时的世界每天都在增加许多的汽车。

293
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.820
We have 10 million cars by region.
按区域计算，我们有一千万辆汽车。

294
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.820
That's an enormous amount of cars.
那可是一个不可小看的数字。

295
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.820
China is adding those cars --
中国正飞速的增加汽车数量－－

296
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.820
India, Russia, Brazil.
印度，俄罗斯，巴西，

297
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.820
We have all these regions.
这些地区都如此。

298
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.820
Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.
欧洲已经把这个问题解决。 他们在汽油上加税。

299
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820
They'll be the first in line to get off
他们将会第一个摆脱对石油的依赖，

300
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.820
because their prices are high.
因为价钱将高得无法让人承受。

301
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.820
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare
中国将会解决用硬性法规这个问题。 他们将会禁止

302
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.820
that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.
任何汽油汽车进入城市。 那会是汽油汽车的最终下场。

303
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.820
The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem
印度人民根本不了解为什么这是一个问题，

304
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820
because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.
因为大部分人在印度每次只加2到3加仑汽油。

305
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.820
For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles
对于他们来说，一个可以行走120英里的电池

306
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.820
is an extension on range, not a reduction in range.
简直是范围的无限扩大，不是范围的缩小。

307
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.820
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.
我们是唯一一个没有将油价设置好的国家。

308
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.820
We don't have the industry set right.
我们也没有把各行业设置好。

309
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.820
We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it
我们没有任何刺激去解决这个问题

310
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.820
across the U.S.
这个现象横跨全美国。

311
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820
Now where is the car industry on that?
汽车工业在这个问题上的位置究竟在哪？

312
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.820
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.
这个非常有意思。 汽车工业一直都只专注在它们自己身上。

313
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.820
They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0
基本上他们查看了形势然后决定，“汽车1.0

314
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.820
we'll solve everything within the car itself."
我们将在汽车身上解决所有问题。“

315
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.820
No infrastructure, no problem.
没有基本设施，没有问题。

316
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.820
We forgot about the entire chain around us.
我们忘记了这些围绕着我们的产业链。

317
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.820
All this stuff that happens around.
这些在我们身边发生的事情。

318
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.820
We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --
我们正关注汽车2.0的发展－－

319
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.820
a whole new market, a whole new business model.
一个全新的市场，一个全新的商业模式。

320
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.820
The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,

321
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.820
to drive the car --
驾驶汽车会促使，

322
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.820
the minutes, the miles if you want,
时间，英里如果那比较便于理解，

323
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.820
that you are all familiar with --

324
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.820
subsidize the price of the car,
用来补助汽车的价钱，

325
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.820
just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.
就像手机一样。你只负责驾驶距离。

326
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820
And some of it will go back to the car maker.
这些钱，一部分将会回到汽车制造商身上。

327
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.820
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.
一部分将会回到你自己的口袋里。

328
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.820
But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.
我们的汽车将比汽油汽车便宜。

329
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.820
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.
这将是一个汽车与风车磨坊相组合的世界。

330
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.820
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark
在丹麦，我们将依赖

331
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.820
from windmills, not from oil.
风力而不是汽油，来驾驶所有的汽车。

332
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.820
In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm

333
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.820
in the south of Israel.
南部建立一个太阳能磨坊。

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.820
And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."
人们说，"你们要的可是一个巨大的空间。”

335
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.820
And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space
我们回答，“如果我们证明在这个空间里

336
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.820
we found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"

337
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.820
And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."
他们说，“我们已经尝试过了。那里没有石油。”

338
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.820
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"
我们说，"不，不，我们能证明，怎么样？“

339
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.820
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,
然后他们说，”那你就挖吧。" 于是我们开始往上挖，

340
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.820
instead of digging down.

341
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.820
These are perfect matches to one another.

Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.

345
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820
That's one percent a year.
那便是平均每年百分之1。

346
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.820
Now when we're looking at solving big problems,
现在我们正要解决一些主要的问题，

347
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820
we need to start thinking in two numbers.

348
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.820
And those are not 20 percent by 2020.
它们并不是在2010年达到百分之20。

349
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.820
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --
这两个数字是零，零排放量和零耗油量，

350
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.820
and scale it infinity.
并且把它们的规模无穷的扩大。

351
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.820
And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year

352
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.820
we can't stop thinking of padding CO2.

We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries

354
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.820
that are willing to go to this kind of scale.

One car emits four tons.

And actually 700 and change million cars today

357
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.820
emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.
排放28亿顿二氧化碳。

358
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.820
That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.
那只是我们所有问题的百分之25。

359
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.820
Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.
汽车跟卡车二氧化碳排放量占世界二氧化碳排放量的百分之25。

360
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.820
We have to come and attack this problem
我们得好好的解决这个问题

361
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.820
with a focus, with an effort that actually says,

we're going to go to zero before the world ends.

I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.
事实上，我与部分美国参议院分享了这个想法。

his uncle was remembered

368

and we'll do it by the end of the decade.

We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.
我们并不是说我们有百分之20的把握把人送到月球。

370
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.820
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.
尽管我们只有大概百分之20的把握能把这个人送回来。

371
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.820
(Laughter)
(笑声)

372
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.820
He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.

200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,

human slaves.
奴隶。

381
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.820
And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?

382
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.820
And what would it do to our economy?
如果我们停止使用奴隶，那我们的经济将变成怎样？

And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.

384
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.820
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids

but within this presidential term

right after we'd lost our morality.
