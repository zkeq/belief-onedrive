3
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.780
and half will not survive.
这些人中的一半最终不治身亡。

4
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.636
This means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.476
It's emotionally draining
它使人承受感情上的痛苦，

12
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.716
and, for many,
对很多人来说，

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.140
financially destructive.
会对财政状况带来毁灭性的影响。

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.260
But a cancer diagnosis doesn't have to be a death sentence.

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.596
Finding cancer early,
越早发现，

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.836
closer its genesis,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.476
reducing its emotional impact
减少精神冲击，

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.460

Most importantly,
最重要的是，

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.876
finding cancer early --
尽早发现癌症——

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.796
which is one of the primary aims of my research --

23
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.980
greatly enhances your odds of survival.
极大增加了存活下来的可能。

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.676
If we just look at the case of breast cancer for example,

25
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.196
we find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one
我们发现在第一阶段诊断并治疗的患者，

26
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.980
have a five-year survival rate of nearly 100 percent --

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.580
odds that decrease to just 22 percent if treated at stage four.
如果停留到第四阶段才开始治疗，该事件的几率就只有22%。

28
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.820
And similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer.
在结肠癌和卵巢癌中也存在相似的规律。

29
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.276
Now, we're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate

33
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.716
often inaccurate
经常不准确，

34
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.380
and they can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results back.
并且它们耗时很久。

35
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.756
Still worse, when it comes to some forms of cancer,
更不好的是，对于某些癌症，

36
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.076
such as ovarian, liver or pancreatic cancer,
比如说卵巢癌、肝癌和胰腺癌，

37
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.780
good screening methods simply don't exist,
我们甚至缺少有效的检测手段，

38
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.756
meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface,
这意味着人们只能等到病情表露时，

39
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.260
which are themselves already indicators of late-stage progression.
这同时也意味着病情已经进入晚期。

40
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.316
Like a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system,
就好像飓风来之前没有有效的预警，

41
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.236
there is no alarm to warn,
癌症没有警告信号，

42
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.116

44
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.476
Having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.836
that are affordable, noninvasive and could provide results much sooner,
方便可行、能够负担且不会造成伤害的常规检验方式，

46
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.300
would provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer.
这种检验方式就是我们对抗癌症的强大武器。

47
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.636
An early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease
提早发现能够使我们在治疗中抢占先机

48
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.396
instead of merely following in its relentless wake.

49
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.396
And this is exactly what I've been doing.
这就是我一直以来尝试去做的。

50
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.556

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.260
with rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics.
早期、即时癌症诊疗的科技。

53
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.596
And I've been fueled by a deep scientific curiosity,

54
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.140
and a passion to change these statistics.

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.900
Last year however,
去年，

56
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.540
this fight became much more personal
当我的妻子被诊断出乳腺癌时，

57
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.180
when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.
这种奋斗增加了更多的个人因素。

58
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.020
It was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension to these efforts.
这个经历为我的研究增加了空前强烈的感情维度。

59
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.340
I know firsthand how life-altering treatment can be,

60
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.996
and I'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc

62
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.900
which in our case included our two young daughters.
对我们来说，还包括了两个年幼的女儿。

63
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.356
Because we found it early during a routine mammogram,

64
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.076
we were able to focus primarily on treatment options
我们能够采取各种治疗手段，

65
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.636
for the localized tumor,
定位肿瘤，

66
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.060
reaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is.
又一次是使我意识到早期诊断的重要性。

67
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.260
Unlike other forms of cancer,

68
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.876
mammograms do offer an early-stage screening option for breast cancer.
乳房X光为乳腺癌提供了一种早期的检查方式。

69
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.116
Still, not everyone has this done,
但并非所有人都会接受检查，

70
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.726
or they may develop breast cancer
或者她们在中年之前，也就是推荐接受检查的时间，

71
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.870
before the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram.
就已经患上乳腺癌。

72
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.636
So, there's still a lot of room for improvement,
所以，我们还有很大前进的空间，

73
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.916
even for cancers that do have screening options,
即便是那些有检查方式的癌症，

74
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.780
and, of course, considerable benefits for those that don't.
另外，这对发现当今未知的诊断手法也有极大的作用。

75
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.236
A key challenge then for cancer researchers

79
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.860
or other liquid biopsy,

80
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.064
and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor's office.
在你离开诊所之前就能够给你结果。

81
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.156
Such a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people

82
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.420
who slip through the net of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.

83
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.476
My research team of engineers and biochemists

84
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.540
is working on exactly this challenge.

86
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.636
by enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy

87
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.956
so that action could be taken to stop cancer the moment it emerges,
所以一旦产生癌症征兆，人们就可以马上采取行动，

88
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.660
and before it can progress beyond its infancy.
而不是等到过了初期治疗阶段。

89
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.476
The silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles,
这里的杀手锏是一种极小的囊泡，

90
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.940
little escape pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes.
是一种名为外泌体的由细胞发散的茧状物。

91
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.236
Exosomes are important biomarkers

that provide an early-warning system for the development of cancer.
在癌症发展过程中起到了早期警告作用。

93
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.956
And because they're abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid,

94
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.476
including blood, urine and saliva,

96
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.436
There's just one problem.

97
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.380
An automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers is not currently available.
能够将生物标记快速分类的自动机制当下并不存在。

98
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.796
We've created a technology that we call nano-DLD

99
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.940

Exosomes are the newest early-warning weapon, if you will, to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.
外泌体是出现在活体细胞中最新发现的早期预警武器。

103
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.796
And they're really, really small.
它们十分微小。

104
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.340
They measure just 30 to 150 nanometers in diameter.
它们的直径仅仅是30到150纳米。

105
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.396
This is so tiny
它们太小，

106
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.060
that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell.
以至于你能够在一个红细胞里放一百万个。

107
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.956
That's roughly the difference between a golf ball
差不多是一个高尔夫球

108
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.700
and a fine grain piece of sand.
和一粒沙子大小的区别。

109
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.436
Once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste,
虽然它们曾经被认为是储存细胞废物的容器，

110
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.436
it has been found that cells actually communicate
但有发现证明，细胞通过

111
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.596
by producing and absorbing these exosomes
产生和吸收外泌体进行沟通交流，

112
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.996
which contain surface receptors,
因为外泌体里面含有表面接收器，

113
00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:46.996
proteins and other genetic material collected from their cell of origin.
蛋白质和从产生细胞中收集的遗传信息。

114
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.996
When absorbed by a neighboring cell,

115
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.836
exosomes release their contents into the receiving cell,
外泌体会将内部物质释放出来，

116
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.076
and can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression --
造成大幅度的遗传信息改变——

117
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.316
some good,
有些是好的，

118
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.676
and this is where cancer comes in, some bad.
有些是不好的，这就是癌症的成因。

119
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.476
Because they are clothed in the material of the mother cell,
因为它们被包裹在母细胞里，

120
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.436
and contain a sample of its environment,

121
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.540
they provide a genetic snapshot of that cell's health and its origin.
它们为细胞的健康和起源提供了一份参考信息。

122
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.156
All of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers
这些特质使得它们成为有效的信息来源，

123
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.740
that potentially allow physicians to eavesdrop on your health at the cellular level.
让医生发现了去从细胞层面检测健康水平的可能性。

124
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.556
To catch cancer early, however,
但是要想尽早发现癌症，

125
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.516
you have to frequently intercept these messages
你必须要频繁拦截查看这些信息，

126
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.036
to determine when cancer-causing troublemakers within your body
看体内的致癌物质，

127
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.876
decide to start staging a coup,
有没有打算发生癌变，

128
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.916
which is why regular screening is so critical
这也是为什么定期体检十分重要，

129
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.780
and why we're developing technologies to make this possible.
以及为什么我们要发展 能够察觉癌症的科技。

130
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.596
While the first exosome-based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year,
第一个外泌体检验仅仅是今年才在市场上出现，

131
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.900
they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options.
它们还不是体检的主流选择。

132
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.996
In addition to their recent emergence,
除了出现的时间过短以外，

133
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.476
another factor that's limiting their widespread adoption
另外一个影响普及的因素是

134
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.436
is that currently, no automated exosome isolation system exists
现在还没有发现合适的自发分离系统，

135
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.660
to make regular screening economically accessible.

The current gold standard for exosome isolation
当下外泌体分离的最佳途径，

137
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.316
includes ultracentrifugation,
比如超速离心法，

138
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.596
a process requiring expensive laboratory equipment,
这个过程需要昂贵的实验器材，

139
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.876
a trained lab tech
经过专业培训的技术人才，

140
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.940
and about 30 hours of time to process a sample.
以及差不多30个小时来处理一份样本。

141
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.076
We've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation
我们想到了一种不同的途径达到同样的目的，

142
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.540
from a sample such as urine.
利用一份样本，比如尿液。

143
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.636
We use a chip-based, continuous flow separation technique
我们使用芯片基础的流动分离技术，

144
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.636
called deterministic lateral displacement.
这个技术名为确定性侧向位移。

145
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.036
And we have done with it
通过这种技术我们达到了

146
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.516
what the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past 50 years.
半导体产业过去50年试图达到的目标。

147
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.596
We shrunk the dimensions of this technology
我们将这种技术的维度

148
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.260
from the micron scale to the true nanoscale.
从微米降到了真正的纳米。

149
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.996
So how does it work?
它的工作原理是什么呢？

150
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.276
In a nutshell,
简单来说，

151
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.276
a set of tiny pillars separated by nanoscopic gaps
许多之间有纳米级空隙的极小柱子，

152
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.636
are arranged in such a way that the system divides the fluid into streamlines,
组成一种能将流体分离开的形式，

153
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.036
with the larger cancer-related nanoparticles being separated
在这种模式下，与癌症相关的纳米粒子

154
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.956
through a process of redirection from the smaller, healthier ones,
会在改道过程中与较小的健康粒子分开，

155
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.516
which can in contrast
比较之下，

156
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.660
move around the pillars in a zigzag-type motion in the direction of fluid flow.
健康的粒子会顺着流向，在柱子周围沿着Z字形移动。

157
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.900
The net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations.
最后就得到完全分开的两种粒子。

158
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.956
You can visualize this separation process
你能够直观地看到这个分离过程，

159
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.836
similar to traffic on a highway that separates into two roads,
就好像高速路上的车分成两路一样，

160
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.316
with one road going into a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,
一条路连到低高度的穿山隧道，

161
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.396
and the other road going around it.
另一条绕过山脉。

162
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.196
Here, smaller cars can go through the tunnel
小车可以走隧道，

163
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.300
while larger trucks, carrying potentially hazardous material, are forced to take the detour route.
带有危险品的卡车就只能绕路。

164
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:43.556
Traffic is effectively separated by size and contents without impeding its flow.
通过区分大小和负载的物质种类，在不影响车流的前提下交通就有效地被分离了。

165
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.860
And this is exactly how our system works on a much, much smaller scale.
把这缩小很多倍，就得到我们的系统的工作原理。

166
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.276
The idea here is that the separation process for screening
这里用到的理念是，癌症检查用到的分离

167
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.356
could be as simple as processing a sample of urine, blood or saliva,
可以只是简单地分析尿液、血液或者唾液，

168
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.676
which is a near-term possibility within the next few years.
这是在很近的未来就有希望解决的问题。

169
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.996
Ultimately, it could be used to isolate and detect target exosomes
我们希望最终能够用这种手段分离出

170
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.236
associated with a particular type of cancer,
与特定癌症相关的外泌体，

171
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.700
sensing and reporting their presence within minutes.
并且在几分钟之内就生成检验结果。

172
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.620
This would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless.
这样就能够使快速检验完全无痛。

173
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.796
Broadly speaking,
大体来说，

174
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.220
the ability to separate and enrich biomarkers with nanoscale precision in an automated way,
有了自动化的途径以及纳米层面的精准分离的手段与对生物标记的使用，

175
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.596
opens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer,
为我们打开了解癌症等疾病的大门，

176
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.596
with applications ranging from sample preparation to diagnostics,
这种技术有各种各样的应用，从样品准备到诊断学，

177
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.100
and from drug resistance monitoring to therapeutics.
从抗药性检测到治疗学。

178
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.276
Even before my wife's bout with cancer,
在我妻子患上癌症之前，

179
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.780
it was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process --
实现检验自动化就是我的梦想——

180
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.596
to make regular screening more accessible,
希望能使得常规检查更加亲民，

181
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.116
similar to the way Henry Ford made the automobile accessible to the general population

182
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.396
through development of the assembly line.

183
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.180
Automation is the key to accessibility.
自动化是实现亲民的根本。

184
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.956
And in the spirit of the Hoover dream,
就好像胡佛之梦的中心，

185
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.876
"a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage,"
“炖锅里有鸡肉，车库里有汽车，”

186
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.316
we're developing a technology
我们在发展的这项技术

187
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:07.380
that could ultimately place an early-warning cancer detection system in every home.
最终能够将早期癌症检测系统带给每个人。

188
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.876
This would allow every man, woman and child
这能够给男性、女性和小孩

189
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.036
the opportunity to be regularly tested while they're still healthy,

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:29.740
physical, financial and emotional -- faced by today's cancer patients, hardships that I'm well acquainted with.
以及免去癌症患者所面对的——我十分熟悉的物质、经济和精神灾难。

194
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.596
I'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife's cancer early,
