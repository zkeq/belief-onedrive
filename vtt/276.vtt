00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.241
Over the past 10 years,
过去的十年，

2
00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:18.834
I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information.
我一直在研究，人们如何整理和构想信息

3
00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:21.645
And I've noticed an interesting shift.
期间我发现了一个有趣的变化。

4
00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:23.706
For a long period of time,
很长一段时间里，

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.158
we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us,
我们相信我们所置身的这个世界的自然秩序，

6
00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:32.927
also known as the great chain of being, or "Scala naturae" in Latin,
也称作“生存巨链”，或拉丁文里的“自然级别”

7
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:37.126
a top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top,
一般以神为顶点而开端自上而下

8
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.555
followed by angels, noblemen,
下面是天使、贵族、

9
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.592
common people, animals, and so on.
平民、动物等。

10
00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:48.094
This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology,
这理念其实是基于亚里士多德的本体论，

11
00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:52.562
which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories,
它将人类所知的东西按对立关系分类，

12
00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.308
like the ones you see behind me.
比如我身后这个例子。

13
00:00:56.507 --> 00:00:59.254
But over time, interestingly enough,
但随着时间的推移，有趣的是

14
00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:03.424
this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree
这个理念吸收了来自树的分支结构，

15
00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:06.321
in what became known as the Porphyrian tree,
后被称为“波菲利之树”，

16
00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:09.987
also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge.
这也被认为是最早的智慧之树。

17
00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:13.232
The branching scheme of the tree was, in fact,
实际上，树的分支结构

18
00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:16.205
such a powerful metaphor for conveying information
可以有效而形象地传递信息。

19
00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.499
that it became, over time, an important communication tool
它逐渐变成了一个重要的交流工具，

20
00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:21.797
to map a variety of systems of knowledge.
用以描绘不同的知识系统。

21
00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:25.551
We can see trees being used to map morality,
我们可以发现树曾被用来描绘道德。

22
00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:28.424
with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices,
如人们熟知的善与恶之树。

23
00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:32.240
as you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe.
比如这些来自欧洲中世纪的美丽插图。

24
00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:35.733
We can see trees being used to map consanguinity,
树也被用以描述血缘关系。

25
00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:38.001
the various blood ties between people.
人们之间各种血缘关系。

26
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.026
We can also see trees being used to map genealogy,
树也被用来描述家族谱系，

27
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.860
perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram.
这可能是最著名而原始的树形图表。

28
00:01:44.884 --> 00:01:48.200
I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees.
我想在座很多听众都见过树形族谱。

29
00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:51.929
Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way.
你们之中的很多人的族谱可能和这些图类似。

30
00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.889
We can see trees even mapping systems of law,
树也被用来描绘法律系统，

31
00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:59.764
the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers.
各种国王和掌权者的法令和规定。

32
00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:05.363
And finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor,
最后，当然它通常还是科学的象征。

33
00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:08.947
we can see trees being used to map all species known to man.
如图，树被用来归纳人类已知物种。

34
00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.903
And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor
最终，树变为一种有效的视觉象征。

35
00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:17.795
because in many ways, they really embody this human desire
因为它在很多方面都能体现，

36
00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.855
for order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry.
人类对秩序、平衡、统一、对称的渴望。

37
00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.142
However, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges
但如今，我们正面临错中复杂的新难题，

38
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.356
that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram.
它们难以用简单的树形来描绘。

39
00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:35.099
And a new metaphor is currently emerging,
一种新的视觉隐喻在逐渐成型，

40
00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:37.273
and it's currently replacing the tree

41
00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:39.860
in visualizing various systems of knowledge.
在各种图形化的知识系统中，

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:44.136
It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us.
它为我们对世界的认识提供了新视角。

43
00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.514
And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network.
这种新形象就是网络结构。

44
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:52.642
And we can see this shift from trees into networks
我们可以发现网络逐渐取代树，

45
00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.306
in many domains of knowledge.
出现在各知识领域。

46
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.519
We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain.
这种转变也发生在我们对大脑的认识。

47
00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:04.326
While before, we used to think of the brain as a modular, centralized organ,
过去我们把大脑看作一个分块的中枢器官，

48
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.388
where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors,
特定的区域控制特定的反应和行为。

49
00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:10.151
the more we know about the brain,
当我们对大脑了解越多，

50
00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:13.461
the more we think of it as a large music symphony,
就越觉得它像一部大型交响乐，

51
00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.095
played by hundreds and thousands of instruments.
由数以千计的乐器演奏出来。

52
00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.795
This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project,
这幅美妙的快照来自于蓝脑计划，

53
00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.882
where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections.
里面有一万个神经元和三千万条连接。

54
00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:28.444
And this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex.
这仅表现了哺乳类的新大脑皮质的10%。

55
00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:34.795
We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge.
这种转变也体现在我们对人类知识的构想。

56
00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.030
These are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science,
这是些很出色的知识树或科学树，

57
00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:41.275
by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.

58
00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.629
And Llull was actually the precursor,
Llull是一个先驱，

59
00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:47.367
the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree,
是首个用树形结构来表现科学的人。

60
00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:50.359
a metaphor we use every single day, when we say,

61
00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:52.048
"Biology is a branch of science,"
“生物学是科学的分支。”

62
00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:53.225
when we say,
当我们说：

63
00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.182
"Genetics is a branch of science."
“遗传学是科学的分支。”

64
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.698
But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me,
于我而言，最美的知识树可能是，

65
00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:04.174
was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.
Diderot和d'Alembert在1751年为法国大百科全书创作的。

68
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:16.488

69
00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:18.630
as separate branches of a tree.
划分于树的各个分支上。

70
00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:22.019
But knowledge is much more intricate than this.
但知识是更错综复杂的。

71
00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:27.254
These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles --

72
00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:31.168
related to history on the left, and mathematics on the right.

73
00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:33.525
And I think by looking at these maps

74
00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:36.093
and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia --
以及维基百科上的其他图，

75
00:04:36.117 --> 00:04:39.509
arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man --
可以说是人类创造的最庞大的根茎结构。

76
00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:43.355
we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate

78
00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:49.438
We can also see this interesting shift

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:52.162
in the way we map social ties between people.

80
00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:55.639
This is the typical organization chart.

84
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.621
that normally starts with the CEO at the very top,

87
00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:19.024
and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure.

88
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:23.641
I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot.

99
00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:58.291
is that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells,

105
00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:16.212
into three different years,

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:30.624
these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization,

113
00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:40.058
We can also see this shift from trees into networks

117
00:06:51.054 --> 00:06:53.315
which Darwin called the "Tree of Life."

118
00:06:53.918 --> 00:06:56.803
There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher,
这实际是他给出版社的信，

119
00:06:56.827 --> 00:06:59.483
expanding on the importance of this particular diagram.

00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:02.149
It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution.
对于达尔文进化论，这很重要。

121
00:07:03.228 --> 00:07:06.795
But recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life

122
00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.254
is a dense network of bacteria,

127
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:23.823
And finally, we can really see this shift, again,

130
00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:32.056
we have all learned at school.

00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:36.010
This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem.

136
00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:52.608
of most ecosystems that abound on our planet.
错综复杂、相互依存的本质。

137
00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:57.906
But even though recent, this metaphor of the network,

138
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.033
is really already adopting various shapes and forms,

139
00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.520
and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy.
变成一门逐渐壮大的视觉分类学，

140
00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:06.191
It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language.
几乎成为一门新语言的语法。

141
00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:08.848
And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me.
这一点非常吸引我。

142
00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:12.031
And these are actually 15 different typologies

143
00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:14.190
I've been collecting over time,
是我逐渐收集到的，

144
00:08:14.214 --> 00:08:18.236
and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor.
图中显示了这新形象极具多样性。

145
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:20.043
And here is an example.
举例而言，

146
00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:24.571
On the very top band, you have radial convergence,
最上排是径向会聚型。

150
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.401
followed by a network of Facebook friends.

151
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.568
You probably couldn't find more disparate topics,
可能你难以找到与此迥异的话题，

152
00:08:43.592 --> 00:08:47.386
yet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model,
但它们都用着相同的形象与视觉模型，

153
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.016
to map the never-ending complexities of its own subject.
用以表现这一主题其自身永无止境的复杂性。

154
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.489
And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting,

157
00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:09.553
As designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems,

160
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.833
and influencing many different artists.
同样影响着不同的艺术家们。

161
00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:20.580
And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them --

162
00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:22.562
they're immensely gorgeous --

163
00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:24.642
they are really becoming a cultural meme,

221
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:35.092
to be really quite striking and fascinating.

222
00:12:35.627 --> 00:12:38.261
Because as Bruce Mau once said,
正如 Bruce Mau 所说，

223
00:12:38.285 --> 00:12:40.697
"When everything is connected to everything else,
