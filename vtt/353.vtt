1
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.748
Will we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change?
我们能否做到不惜一切代价来应对气候变化？

2
00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:22.186
I come at this question not as a green campaigner,
我不是作为环保倡议者来思考这个问题，

3
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.805
in fact, I confess to be rather hopeless at recycling.
事实上，我对回收利用不抱希望。

4
00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:30.489
I come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making
我是一名专业的金融政策观察者，

5
00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:35.270
and someone that wonders how history will judge us.
同时也想知道后世将如何评价我们。

6
00:00:36.173 --> 00:00:37.429
One day,
将来有一天，

7
00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:43.349
this ring that belonged to my grandfather will pass to my son, Charlie.
我爷爷的这枚戒指会传给我儿子查理。

8
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:46.649
And I wonder what his generation
我很想知道我儿子那一代人

9
00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:48.979
and perhaps the one that follows
和他们的下一代

10
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.841
will make of the two lives this ring has worked.
将如何度过他们的人生。

11
00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:57.338
My grandfather was a coal miner.
我的爷爷是位矿工

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.497
In his time,
在他那个年代，

13
00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:06.586
burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop was accepted.
靠燃烧化石燃料获得能源并推动经济发展是可以接受的。

14
00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:10.397
We know now that that is not the case
尽管今天我们知道那样做是不对的

15
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:13.803
because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces.
因为煤炭燃烧会产生温室气体。

16
00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:16.352
But today,
但如今，

17
00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:20.422
I fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly
恐怕我所从事的行业，会被认为

18
00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.482
because of its impact on the climate --
对气候的危害更大——

19
00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:25.665
more harshly than my grandfather's industry, even.
以至于我们会背负更重的骂名。

20
00:01:26.022 --> 00:01:28.708
I work, of course, in the banking industry,
刚刚说过了，我在银行业工作，

21
00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:32.524
which will be remembered for its crisis in 2008 --
而这个行业因为2008年金融危机永垂史册——

22
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:38.542
a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments
这场危机将政府的注意力和财政支出

23
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:43.947
away from some really, really important promises,
从真正重要的事情上转移了，

24
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:49.111
like promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009
比如政府在2009年哥本哈根气候大会上作出的承诺，

25
00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.967
to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year
每年调动1000亿美元

26
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:56.505
to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels
帮助发展中国家停止使用化石燃料

27
00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.508
and transition to using cleaner energy.
转而使用更清洁的能源。

28
00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:03.211
That promise is already in jeopardy.
这一承诺早已岌岌可危。

29
00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.589
And that's a real problem,
这是个很严重的问题，

30
00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:10.290
because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later.
因为实现能源清洁化刻不容缓。

31
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:12.160
Firstly,
首先，

32
00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:14.162
because greenhouse gases, once released,
温室气体一旦产生，

33
00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:16.879
stay in the atmosphere for decades.
会在大气中停留数十年。

34
00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.091
And secondly,
其次，

35
00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:23.942
if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today,
如果今天，发展中国家使用化石燃料建立电网，

36
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.119
it's going to be way more costly to change later on.
将来再想转变，代价会更为不菲。

37
00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:36.135
So for the climate, history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time.
因此将来回顾历史，会发现这场金融危机来得真不凑巧，对解决气候问题不利。

38
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.428
The story need not be this gloomy, though.
但我们倒不必过于悲观。

39
00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.397
Three years ago,
三年前,

40
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:46.317
I argued that governments could use the tools
我呼吁政府使用

41
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.026
deployed to save the financial system
挽救金融系统的工具

42
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.938
to meet other global challenges.
来应对其他全球性挑战.

43
00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:56.861
And these arguments are getting stronger, not weaker, with time.
随着时间推移，这一呼声并未减弱，而是越来越强。

44
00:02:58.154 --> 00:03:02.566
Let's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like.
让我们来回忆一下有些什么样的工具。

45
00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:06.385
When the financial crisis hit in 2008,
2008年金融危机发生时，

46
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.986
the central banks of the US and UK
美国和英国的中央银行

47
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.445
began buying bonds issued by their own governments
开始购买本国政府发行的债券，

48
00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.768
in a policy known as "quantitative easing."
这项政策叫做“量化宽松”。

49
00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:18.915
Depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature,
当这些债券到期时，

50
00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.349
this is money printing by another name.
我们发现，这就是在增印钞票。

51
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.074
And boy, did they print.
印的还真不少。

52
00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:29.172
The US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency.
单单美国就相当于增发了4万亿美元。

53
00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:31.285
This was not done in isolation.
而且不单单是美国一家。

54
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:38.580
In a remarkable act of cooperation, the 188 countries that make up the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,
国际货币基金组织的188个成员国，紧密团结，精诚合作，

55
00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:42.773
agreed to issue 250 billion dollars' worth of their own currency --
相当于增发了2500亿美元的货币——

56
00:03:42.797 --> 00:03:44.869
the Special Drawing Right --
以“特别提款权”的形式——

57
00:03:44.893 --> 00:03:46.866
to boost reserves around the world.
从而在世界范围内增加储备。

58
00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:50.083
When the financial crisis moved to Europe,
当金融危机蔓延至欧洲，

59
00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:54.887
the European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi,
欧洲中央银行行长马里奥·德拉吉，

60
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:57.675
promised "to do whatever it takes."
承诺“不惜一切代价”。

61
00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:00.588
And they did.
他们确实也这么做了。

62
00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:05.870
The Bank of Japan repeated those words -- that exact same commitment --
日本银行也做出了同样的承诺，

63
00:04:05.894 --> 00:04:10.005
to do "whatever it takes" to reflate their economy.
“不惜一切代价” 来复苏经济。

64
00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:13.196
In both cases,
这两个例子中，

65
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.459
"whatever it takes" meant trillions of dollars more
所谓的“代价”就是增发数以万亿计的纸币，

66
00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:20.711
in money-printing policies that continue today.
这一政策今天还在继续。

67
00:04:21.154 --> 00:04:22.942
What this shows
这说明，

68
00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:26.732
is that when faced with some global challenges,
在面对某些全球性挑战时，

69
00:04:27.882 --> 00:04:32.527
policy makers are able to act collectively, with urgency,
政策制定者能够在危急时刻集体行动，

70
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:38.681
and run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing.
剑走偏锋，制定出类似增发货币这样的政策。

71
00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:43.380
So, let's go back to that original question:
好，让我们回到开始的问题：

72
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.175
Can we print money for climate finance?
我们可以增发货币用于气候融资吗？

73
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.751
Three years ago,
三年前，

74
00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:54.510
the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo.
以这样的方式使用资金是一种禁忌。

75
00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:57.710
Once you break down and dismantle the idea
一旦你的观念被转变，

76
00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.773
that money is a finite resource,
不再认为钱是有限资源，

77
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.883
governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people
政府很快就会就会被人民的需求淹没，

78
00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:08.133
to print more and more money for other causes:
为了各种原因不停增发货币：

79
00:05:08.157 --> 00:05:10.157
education, health care, welfare --
教育、医疗、福利——

80
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.411
even defense.
甚至国防。

81
00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:17.642
And there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing --
而增发货币会带来可怕后果，历史上有很多例子——

82
00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.989
uncontrolled money printing --
当然我指的是滥发货币——

83
00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:21.758
leading to hyperinflation.
会导致恶性通货膨胀。

84
00:05:22.584 --> 00:05:26.170
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;
回想一下1930年的魏玛共和国，

85
00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:29.267
Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,
以及更近一些的，2008年的津巴布韦，

86
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:33.355
when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day.
生活必需品，比如面包，价格每天翻番。

87
00:05:34.712 --> 00:05:39.716
But all of this is moving the public debate forward,
但这一切都在引发公众广泛讨论，

88
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.068
so much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly
以至于现在人们公开讨论增发货币，

89
00:05:45.092 --> 00:05:49.306
in the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.
在金融媒体上，甚至在某些政治宣言中。

90
00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:52.562
But it's important the debate doesn't stop here,
但更为重要的是，

91
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.769
with printing national currencies.
这些讨论并未局限于增发本国货币。

92
00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:01.671
Because climate change is a shared global problem,
由于气候变化是全球性问题，

93
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.765
there are some really compelling reasons
我们有特别紧迫的理由，

94
00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.218
why we should be printing that international currency
来增发国际货币，

95
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.100
that's issued by the IMF,
支持国际货币基金组织，

96
00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:11.355
to fund it.
应对气候问题。

97
00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:14.969
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,
特别提款权，也就是SDR

98
00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:18.349
is the IMF's electronic unit of account
是国际货币基金组织的电子记账单位，

99
00:06:18.373 --> 00:06:22.925
that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other.
用于政府间的资金转移。

100
00:06:23.753 --> 00:06:26.494
Think of it as a peer-to-peer payment network,
可以把它想象成一个对等式支付网络，

101
00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:29.294
like Bitcoin, but for governments.
就像比特币一样，只不过用在政府间。

102
00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:32.040
And it's truly global.
而且它真正具有全球性。

103
00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:38.097
Each of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas
188个成员国都有SDR配额

104
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:40.863
as part of their foreign exchange reserves.
作为本国外汇储备的一部分。

105
00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:44.043
These are national stores of wealth
它们是国家的财富储备，

106
00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:47.498
that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises.
可以帮助国家应对货币危机。

107
00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:50.879
And that global nature is why,
正是这全球性的特点，

108
00:06:50.903 --> 00:06:53.831
at the height of the financial crisis in 2009,
使得国际货币基金组织在2009年，

109
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.948
the IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars --
也就是金融危机最严重的时候增发了2500亿美元——

110
00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:02.543
because it served as a collective global action
因为这是一次全球性的集体行动

111
00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:07.374
that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.
一举保护了大大小小的国家，免受冲击。

112
00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:10.159
But here --
但接下来，

113
00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:11.849
here's the intriguing part.
才是真正耐人寻味的部分。

114
00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:18.105
More than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 --
2009年增发的SDR，其中一大半——

115
00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.115
150 billion dollars' worth --
大约有1500亿美元——

116
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.454
went to developed market countries who, for the most part,
分配给了发达国家，

117
00:07:23.264 --> 00:07:27.345
have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves,
但它们中的大部分并不太需要这些外汇储备，

118
00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:29.770
because they have flexible exchange rates.
因为这些国家执行浮动汇率制度。

119
00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:34.628
So those extra reserves that were printed in 2009,
因此，这些2009年增发的配额，

120
00:07:34.652 --> 00:07:38.123
in the end, for developed market countries at least,
对于发达国家来说，

121
00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:39.773
weren't really needed.
并没有太大意义。

122
00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:42.601
And they remain unused today.
直到今天也没有被使用。

123
00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:44.822
So here's an idea.
于是我产生了一个想法。

124
00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:46.218
As a first step,
首先，

125
00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:49.932
why don't we start spending those unused,
为什么我们不将这些2009年增发的，

126
00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:53.423
those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009,
尚未使用的特别提款权，

127
00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:54.994
to combat climate change?
用来应对气候变化？

128
00:07:55.768 --> 00:07:57.281
They could, for example,
比如，

129
00:07:57.305 --> 00:08:02.005
be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund.
用这笔钱购买联合国发行的绿色气候基金。

130
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.617
This was a fund created in 2009,
绿色气候基金设立于2009年，

131
00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:08.915
following that climate agreement in Copenhagen.
依据哥本哈根大会气候协议设立。

132
00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:14.082
And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries
其目的是为发展中国家筹集资金

133
00:08:14.106 --> 00:08:16.173
to meet their climate projects.
以支持他们的气候项目。

134
00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:19.056
It's been one of the most successful funds of its type,
作为同类基金中最成功的一只，

135
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.384
raising almost 10 billion dollars.
它已经筹集了近百亿美元。

136
00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:24.846
But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued,
如果我们能将增发的SDR使用起来，

137
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.182
it helps governments get back on track,
就可以帮助各国政府回归正途，

138
00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:33.643
to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis.
实现因金融风暴而拖欠的每年1000亿美元的承诺。

139
00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:37.494
It could also --
除此以外——

140
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:40.164
it could also serve as a test case.
我们可以将其视为一次测试。

141
00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:47.275
If the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign,
如果这么使用SDR不会造成恶性通货膨胀，

142
00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.249
it could be used to justify
那么我们有理由假设，

143
00:08:50.273 --> 00:08:55.007
the additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years,
如果每五年增发一次SDR，

144
00:08:55.031 --> 00:08:57.426
again, with the commitment
当然，这也需要发达国家承诺，

145
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.880
that developed-market countries would direct their share
将自己得到的配额，

146
00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:05.182
of the new reserves to the Green Climate Fund.
直接转给绿色气候基金。

147
00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:12.705
Printing international money in this way has several advantages over printing national currencies.
这样发行国际货币比发行本国货币有更多好处。

148
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.135
The first is it's really easy to argue
首先，很明显，

149
00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:20.576
that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone.
将这笔钱花在应对气候变化上，对所有人都有益。

150
00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:25.045
No one section of society benefits from the printing press over another.
没有哪个国家会因为多印了些钞票而更加得利。

151
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:28.853
That problem of competing claims is mitigated.
因此大家不用考虑竞争的问题。

152
00:09:29.283 --> 00:09:30.623
It's also fair to say
也可以这么说，

153
00:09:30.647 --> 00:09:35.774
that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs,
正因为众多国家一致同意增发SDR，

154
00:09:35.798 --> 00:09:40.001
it's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control.
这件事就不太容易失控。

155
00:09:40.818 --> 00:09:45.845
What you end up with is a collective, global action
最终，我们看到的是一项全球性的集体行动，

156
00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:50.032
aimed -- and it's controlled global action --
并受全球各国监管，

157
00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:52.645
aimed at a global good.
瞄准的是全球共同利益。

158
00:09:53.457 --> 00:09:54.665
And,
此外，

159
00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:57.256
as we've learned with the money-printing schemes,
因为我们已经了解了货币发行的机制，

160
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.112
whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules.
任何问题和顾虑，都可以通过规则来排除。

161
00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:02.459
So, for example,
比如说，

162
00:10:02.483 --> 00:10:07.456
the issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped,
可以限制每五年所发行的SDR的总金额，

163
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:15.061
such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves.
使其不超过全球外汇储备总量的5%。

164
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:17.626
That's important because it would allay
这点很重要，

165
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.546
well, let's say, the ridiculous concerns that the US might have
因为这样会减轻美国的担忧，

166
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:27.712
that the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role in international finance.
他们老担心增发的SDR会挑战美元在国际金融市场的主导地位。

167
00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:29.817
And in fact,
实际上，

168
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:34.728
I think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme
在这种体制下，SDR有可能对美元产生的唯一的影响

169
00:10:34.752 --> 00:10:38.223
is its nickname, the "greenback."
就是盗用美元的外号，“绿钞票”。

170
00:10:38.247 --> 00:10:42.163
Because even with that cap in place,
因为，即使有发行限额的规定，

171
00:10:42.187 --> 00:10:45.651
the IMF could have followed up its issuance --
国际货币基金组织依旧会追踪其发行状况-——

172
00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:48.723
its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --
无论是2009年的2500亿——

173
00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:53.739
with a further 200 billion dollars of SDRs in 2014.
还是2014年追加的2000亿。

174
00:10:54.536 --> 00:10:56.870
So hypothetically,
因此，从理论上说，

175
00:10:57.872 --> 00:11:07.209
that would mean that developed countries could have contributed up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs to the Green Climate Fund.
发达国家能够为绿色气候基金贡献价值约3000亿美元的特别提款权。

176
00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:11.466
That's 30 times what it has today.
金额是该基金目前筹款额的30倍。

177
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.646
And you know,
而且，

178
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.511
as spectacular as that sounds,
尽管这听起来已经相当可观，

179
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.590
it's only just beginning to look like "whatever it takes."
却刚刚才有一点“不惜一切代价”的味道。

180
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:24.267
And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money,
想想看，我们可以用这笔钱完成多大的壮举，

181
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:25.502
consider this:
举个例子：

182
00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:28.066
in 2009,
在2009年，

183
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.828
Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil
挪威承诺，给巴西10亿美元的外汇储备，

184
00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:37.515
if they followed through on their goals on deforestation.
只要巴西能达成减少森林砍伐的目标。

185
00:11:38.413 --> 00:11:44.712
That program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation
这一计划实施十年时间，

186
00:11:41.296 --> 00:11:46.147
in the past decade.
已经减少了70%的森林砍伐。

187
00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:51.084
That's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions,
相当于减少了32亿吨二氧化碳排放，

188
00:11:51.108 --> 00:11:55.639
which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads
相当于让全美国所有的汽车

189
00:11:55.663 --> 00:11:57.949
for three whole years.
停驶整整3年。

190
00:11:59.524 --> 00:12:00.826
So what could we do
想象一下，

191
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.894
with 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that,
如果全球再有300个类似的“按劳取酬”的气候项目，

192
00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:08.797
organized on a global scale?
该是多么棒的一件事。

193
00:12:09.757 --> 00:12:12.624
We could take cars off the roads for a generation.
相当于让整整一代人的车辆停驶。

194
00:12:13.204 --> 00:12:14.354
So,
因此，

195
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:20.103
let's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change.
不要再纠结我们是否有经济能力来应对气候变化。

196
00:12:20.697 --> 00:12:22.945
The real question is:
真正的问题是：

197
00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:26.366
Do we care enough about future generations
我们是否足够关心下一代

198
00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:31.354
to take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system?
愿意冒很大的风险去拯救气候。

199
00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.241
After all,
毕竟，

200
00:12:33.984 --> 00:12:36.071
we could do it,
我们能够这么做，

201
00:12:36.104 --> 00:12:39.010
we did do it and we are doing it today.
我们曾经成功过，我们还将继续努力。

202
00:12:39.628 --> 00:12:43.946
We must, must, must do "whatever it takes."
我们必须真的“不惜一切代价去做”。

203
00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:46.397
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

204
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.787
(Applause)
