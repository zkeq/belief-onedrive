00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.791
On the path that American children  travel to adulthood,

2
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:20.339
two institutions oversee the journey.
有两个机构在这段旅程上至关重要。

3
00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.082
The first is the one we hear  a lot about: college.
第一个是大家经常听到的：大学。

4
00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.665
Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt
某些人可能还记得

5
00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:29.251
when you first set off for college.

7
00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:34.818
and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment.
并且正在享受那份兴奋

8
00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:37.487
College has some shortcomings.
大学有很多弊端

9
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.823
It's expensive; it leaves young people in debt.
学费昂贵，所以年轻人负债累累

10
00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:43.767
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.
但总而言之，这是一条康庄大道

11
00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:48.934
Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends

12
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.273
and with a lot of knowledge  about the world.

13
00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:53.109
And perhaps most importantly,
或许更重要的是

14
00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.615
a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there.
上大学使得他们能有更好的就业机会

15
00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:00.318
Today I want to talk about the second institution
今天我想讨论的是第二个机构

16
00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:05.876
overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States.
在美国，贯穿了从童年到成年的整个人生经历

17
00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:09.631
And that institution is prison.
那个机构便是监狱

18
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:14.356
Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers
在这段旅程上，相伴着年轻人的

19
00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.759
instead of with teachers.
是感化官而不是教师

20
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.652
They're going to court dates instead of to class.
去法庭受审而不是去教室上课

21
00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:25.729
Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility.
他们的大三留学之旅是去州立管教所

22
00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.419
And they're emerging from their 20s

23
00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:31.616
not with degrees in business and English,
没有商科的或英语的学位

24
00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:33.634
but with criminal records.
有的只是犯罪记录

25
00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.927
This institution is also costing us a lot,
这个机构同样花费甚多

26
00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:42.337
about 40,000 dollars a year to send a young person to prison in New Jersey.
在新泽西，送一个年轻人到监狱的花费一年要大约4万美元

27
00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:45.543
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill
但是这是纳税人买的单

28
00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:49.026
and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell
而孩子们得到的只是一个冰冷的牢房单间

29
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.836
and a permanent mark against them when they come home
和一个永久的印记，阻碍着他们回归家庭

30
00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:54.585
and apply for work.
或者寻找工作

31
00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:58.031
There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood
越来越多的孩子在这条路上长大成人

32
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:03.255
than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past 40 years,
尤其在美国，这是因为在过去的四十年里

33
00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:09.007
our incarceration rate  has grown by 700 percent.
我们服刑率已经增长了700%

34
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:11.136
I have one slide for this talk.
我制作了一张幻灯片

35
00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.390
Here it is.
看这儿

36
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.443
Here's our incarceration rate,
这是我们的服刑率

37
00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:21.735
about 716 people per 100,000 in the population.
每十万人就有716人服刑

38
00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:25.885
Here's the OECD countries.
这是其他OECD（经合组织）成员国家的情况

39
00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:33.437
What's more, it's poor kids that we're sending to prison,
更为重要的是，被送入监狱的孩子往往家境贫寒

40
00:02:33.437 --> 00:02:36.925
too many drawn from African-American and Latino communities
他们大多来自非裔美国人和拉丁裔社区

41
00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:41.806
so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it
以至于监狱成为了想要成功的年轻人

42
00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:45.238
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.
实现美国梦的障碍

43
00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:48.094
The problem's actually  a bit worse than this
问题是事实更为糟糕

44
00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.772
'cause we're not just sending  poor kids to prison,
因为我们不只是把贫困的孩子送入监狱

45
00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:53.739
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,
我们还给他们加上了许多沉重的枷锁，比如诉讼费的负担

46
00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.060
with probation and parole restrictions,
比如感化和假释的限制

47
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.947
with low-level warrants,
比如轻微的犯罪通缉

48
00:02:57.947 --> 00:03:01.442
we're asking them to live  in halfway houses and on house arrest,
我们让他们待在过渡教习所或者软禁在家

49
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:05.047
and we're asking them  to negotiate a police force
我们让他们和警察交涉

50
00:03:05.047 --> 00:03:07.460
that is entering poor communities of color,
而当这些警察要进入有色人种的社区

51
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.659
not for the purposes  of promoting public safety,
不是为了改善公共安全

52
00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.135
but to make arrest counts, to line city coffers.
而是为了政绩去保证逮捕数量

53
00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:22.745
This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment:
这就是关于我们印象中的惩戒措施的不为人知的一面

54
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:27.791
young people worried that at any moment, they will be stopped, searched and seized.
年轻人总是担心随时会被截停、搜身和逮捕

55
00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:31.078
Not just in the streets,  but in their homes,
无论是在街上还是在家

56
00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.515
at school and at work.
在学校还是在工作

57
00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:37.936
I got interested in this  other path to adulthood
大约2000年年初的时候

58
00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:40.177
when I was myself a college student
当时我自己在宾夕法尼亚大学上学

59
00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:44.313
attending the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2000s.
我对这种别样的人生成长轨迹产生了兴趣

60
00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:47.880
Penn sits within a historic  African-American neighborhood.
大学坐落在一个历史悠久的非裔社区旁

61
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.118
So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously:
所以在这里你能同时看到两条平行的人生轨迹

62
00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:56.239
the kids attending  this elite, private university,
一边是在这所精英的私立大学上学的孩子

63
00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.705
and the kids from  the adjacent neighborhood,
另外一边是在附近社区的孩子

64
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.633
some of whom are making it to college,
他们中有一些也在努力去读大学

65
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:04.131
and many of whom  are being shipped to prison.
但是他们中的大多数却身陷囹圄

66
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:09.235
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school

67
00:04:09.235 --> 00:04:12.229
who lived about 10 minutes away from the university.

68
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.762
Soon, her cousin came home  from a juvenile detention center.
不久，她的表弟（堂弟）从少年拘留所回到家

He was 15, a freshman in high school.
他当时15岁，上高中一年级

70
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.079
I began to get to know him  and his friends and family,

71
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.431
and I asked him what he thought  about me writing about his life
我问他能否在我的毕业论文中

72
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.016
for my senior thesis in college.
讲述他的生活

73
00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:32.207
This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton
这篇论文也成为了我在普林斯顿的博士论文

74
00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:33.755
and now a book.
现在则集结成书

75
00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.353
By the end of my sophomore year,
在我大学二年级结束的时候

76
00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:38.723
I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years

77
00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:43.314
trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age.

78

In the first 18 months that I lived in this neighborhood,

他们住在一个两层楼的联排房屋里，前面有草坪，后面有走廊

他们成长过程中，他们的母亲一直都为毒瘾所扰

She never really was able  to hold down a job for very long.

125
00:06:55.062 --> 00:06:58.101
It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family,

But anyway, since Chuck was 18,

他因为无力支付保释金被关在那---他根本就付不起

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.086
through almost his entire senior year.
几乎占了他高中最后的一整年

143
00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:50.796
Finally, near the end of this season,

144
00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:54.143
the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges
法官驳回了大部分关于这起袭击案的指控

145
00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:55.477

146
00:07:55.477 --> 00:07:59.824
with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head.

147

Tim was pretty happy that day.
提姆那天很开心

148
00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:05.121
The next fall, Chuck tried  to re-enroll as a senior,

149
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:07.135
but the school secretary told him that

150
00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:10.266
he was then 19 and too old  to be readmitted.
他已经19岁了，已经超龄而没有资格复读了

151
00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:13.933
Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest
紧接着，负责他袭击案的法官又签署了一份他的通缉

152
00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:17.208
because he couldn't pay  the 225 dollars in court fees

153
00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:20.735
that came due a few weeks after the case ended.

155
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:26.807
Tim's first arrest came later that year

159
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:36.891
and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car.
当时他用他女友的车载提姆到学校

160
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.626
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,
一个警察把他们截停，调查车的来源

161
00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:43.411
and the car comes up  as stolen in California.

162
00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:47.534
Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen.
查克根本就不知道这辆车其实是赃物

163
00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:52.477
His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast Philly.
是他女友的叔叔在一个费城东北的二手车拍卖会上买的

164
00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:55.305
Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri-state,

00:08:57.654 --> 00:08:59.752
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

167
00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:03.320
charged Chuck with  receiving stolen property.
还是以窝赃的罪名起诉了查克

168
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.132

With this probation sentence  hanging over his head,

and began teaching him how to run from the police.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.084
looking out into the shared alleyway

how to negotiate a late-night police raid, how and where to hide.
怎样和深夜巡逻的警察交涉，还有哪里能躲避

179
00:09:38.831 --> 00:09:40.511
I want you to imagine for a second
我想让你们想象一下

180
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:42.880
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like
如果查克和提姆住在

181
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.058
if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college, not prison.
邻居孩子都能去大学读书，而不是去监狱的社区里

182
00:09:49.738 --> 00:09:52.891
A neighborhood like the one  I got to grow up in.
就像我长大的社区他们的生活会是怎样？

183
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:54.356
Okay, you might say.
好的，你也许会说

184
00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:58.108
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them, they're committing crimes!
但是像查克和提姆这样的孩子，他们确实犯罪了！

185
00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:00.234
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

Don't they deserve to be  living in fear of arrest?

188
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.250
They don't.

And certainly not for the same things  that other young people

190
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.721
with more privilege are doing with impunity.

191
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:16.538
If Chuck had gone to my high school,
如果查克去了我的高中

192
00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:18.861
that schoolyard fight  would have ended there,

193
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:20.537
as a schoolyard fight.
而止于学校内部

194
00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:24.087
It never would have become an aggravated assault case.
根本就不会成为一起严重袭击案件

195
00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:27.578
Not a single kid that I went to college with

196
00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:29.257
has a criminal record right now.

But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids
但是你能想象如果警察截停这些上学路上的孩子

199
00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:39.003
and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class?

200
00:10:39.003 --> 00:10:43.064
Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night?
或者在半夜突击检查他们的朋友聚会，他们会留下多少犯罪记录吗？

201
00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:45.476
Okay, you might say.
好的，你也许会说

202
00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:47.466
But doesn't this high incarceration rate
但是高服刑率

203
00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:50.219
partly account for our  really low crime rate?

204
00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:52.643
Crime is down. That's a good thing.
犯罪率下降了，这是好事。

205
00:10:52.643 --> 00:10:55.130
Totally, that is a good thing. Crime is down.
没错，犯罪率下降是好事。

206
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.657
It dropped precipitously in the '90s and through the 2000s.
从90年代到本世纪初，犯罪率大幅下降

207
00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:00.702
But according to a committee of academics

208
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.356

209
00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:08.365
the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates
我们历史上高服刑率

210
00:11:08.365 --> 00:11:11.949
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.
和我们的低犯罪率的关系并不十分牢靠

211
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:15.389
It turns out that the crime rate goes up and down
犯罪率的高低

212
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:19.915
irrespective of how many young people we send to prison.
和我们送多少年轻人进监狱并无关系

213
00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:24.178
We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way:
我们总是在一个狭窄的范围下思考正义

214
00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:27.782
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

215
00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:31.137
Injustice is about being  wrongfully convicted.
不正义就是被错误的定罪

216
00:11:31.137 --> 00:11:33.452
So if you're convicted  of something you did do,
所以如果你因为自己做过的事被定罪

217
00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:35.287
you should be punished for it.
你就应该受到相应的惩罚

218
00:11:35.287 --> 00:11:37.053
There are innocent and guilty people,
总是用无辜的和有罪的人

219
00:11:37.053 --> 00:11:39.490
there are victims and  there are perpetrators.
总是有被害者和犯罪者

220
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.891
Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that.
如果我们能再思考地更广一点

221
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.325
Right now, we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

226
00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:04.299

227
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:08.110
to basically never do anything wrong.

228
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.611
Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges?
为什么我们不提供给这些孩子面对这些挑战的帮助呢？

229
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:19.857
Why are we offering only handcuffs, jail time and this fugitive existence?
为什么我们提供的只有手铐，监狱和逃亡生活呢？

230
00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:22.363
Can we imagine something better?
我们就不能想象一点更好的事情吗？

231
00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:26.618
Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery,

232
00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:29.205
prevention, civic inclusion,

233

A criminal justice system  that acknowledges
这个司法系统

236
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.930
the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced
承认有色人种在美国被隔离和疏远的历史

237
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.086
and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions.
并且不会再促进和保持这种隔离和疏远

238
00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:53.471
(Applause)
（鼓掌）

239
00:12:55.111 --> 00:12:59.673
And finally, a criminal justice system that believes in black young people,
最终，这个司法系统更信任这些黑人青年

240
00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:03.537
rather than treating black young people  as the enemy to be rounded up.
而不是不是把这些黑人青年当作敌人来对待

241
00:13:03.537 --> 00:13:07.260

（鼓掌）

242
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.107
The good news is that we already are.
好消息是，我们已经在努力之中

243

A few years ago, Michelle Alexander wrote "The New Jim Crow,"
几年前，米歇尔亚历山大撰写了《The New Jim Crow》这本书

of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before.
