I want them to be happy and healthy in their lives,

There's so many books offering all kinds of conflicting advice,

it can be really overwhelming.

20
00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:03.991
However, something changed me a few years ago,

21
00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:06.813
when I came across a little secret that we have in Britain.
那时我无意间发现了 我们英国的一个小秘密。

It's helped me become more confident about how I bring up my own children,
它使我对于如何养育小孩 有了更多的自信，

23
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:14.220
and it's revealed a lot about how we as a society can help all children.

24
00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:16.923
I want to share that secret with you today.

For the last 70 years,

Collecting information on thousands of children

30
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.642
is a really powerful thing to do,
真的是一件很厉害的事，

31
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.953
because it means we can compare the ones who say,

and then we can sift through all the information we've collected

and try to work out why their lives turned out different.

This British study -- it's actually a kind of crazy story.

So it all starts back in 1946,

82
00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.863
perhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study.

83
00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:06.225
And it's also the one that spoke to me personally,
它对于我个人来说也是挺有意义的，

84
00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.563
because it's about how to use science to do the best for our children.
因为它是关于如何利用科学 去为孩子们做到最好的。

85
00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.326
So, let's get the bad news out of the way first.

86
00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:17.202
Perhaps the biggest message from this remarkable study is this:

don't be born into poverty or into disadvantage,
不要出生在贫穷落后的家庭，

88

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:25.240
you're far more likely to walk a difficult path in life.
你就更有可能走上一条 艰难的人生道路。

Many children in this study were born into poor families

91
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.277
or into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems,
或者有其它各种问题的 贫困家庭或工人阶级家庭，

92
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:35.779
and it's clear now that those disadvantaged children

93
00:04:35.803 --> 00:04:38.895
have been more likely to struggle on almost every score.

to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money.

96

Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,
也许这些听起来像是明摆的事，

97
00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:48.798
but some of the results have been really surprising,
但是也有一些结果令人很吃惊，

98
00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.775
so children who had a tough start in life
那些人生的起点就很艰苦的小孩

99
00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.303
are also more likely to end up unhealthy as adults.

100
00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.433
They're more likely to be overweight,

to have high blood pressure,
患上高血压，

00:04:56.816 --> 00:04:58.909
and then decades down the line,

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:03.306
more likely to have a failing memory, poor health and even to die earlier.
更有可能记忆衰退、身体不佳 甚至死得更早。

104
00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:08.631
Now, I talked about what happens later,
我上面谈到的都是一些后期的影响，

105
00:05:08.655 --> 00:05:11.972
but some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age.
但是有一些差异是在 一个令人震惊的早期就显现出来的。

106
00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:13.630
In one study,

children who were growing up in poverty

109
00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:21.372
and that was by the age of just three.
而这还只是在他们3岁的时候。

110
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.298
These types of differences have been found again and again across the generations.
这种的差异在几代人之间 一次又一次的被发现。

111
00:05:26.322 --> 00:05:29.592
It means that our early circumstances have a profound influence

112
00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:32.261
on the way that the rest of our lives play out.

113
00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:33.715
And working out why that is
而找出这其中的原因,

114
00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:36.559
is one of the most difficult questions that we face today.
是我们今天所面对的 最困难的问题之一。

115
00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:39.431
So there we have it.

116
00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:42.131
The first lesson for successful life, everyone, is this:

117
00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:44.011
choose your parents very carefully.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:45.036

Don't be born into a poor family or into a struggling family.

120
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.047
Now, I'm sure you can see the small problem here.
我敢肯定你们可以看出 这里的一个小问题，

121
00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:55.509
We can't choose our parents or how much they earn,
那就是我们不能选择父母或者 他们的收入水平，

122
00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:58.762
but this British study has also struck a real note of optimism
但这项英国的研究通过展现不是所有

123
00:05:58.786 --> 00:06:02.137
by showing that not everyone who has a disadvantaged start
出身卑微的人最终都陷入困境

124
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:04.756
ends up in difficult circumstances.

00:06:05.287 --> 00:06:07.740
As you know, many people have a tough start in life,
正如你所知道的，很多人出身贫苦

126
00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:10.623
but they end up doing very well on some measure nevertheless,

127
00:06:10.647 --> 00:06:12.438
and this study starts to explain how.
而这个研究将要解释如何实现这个。

128
00:06:13.278 --> 00:06:15.379
So the second lesson is this:
所以第二课是：

129
00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:17.228
parents really matter.
父母真的很重要。

130

were more likely to escape from a difficult start.

It seems that parents and what they do are really, really important,

135
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.264
especially in the first few years of life.

144
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.118
The data showed that what mattered more than anything else was parents.

Having engaged, interested parents in those first few years of life

146
00:06:59.764 --> 00:07:03.471
was strongly linked to children going on to do well at school later on.

In fact, quite small things that parents do

148
00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:09.647

00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:20.873
Reading to children every day seems to be really important, too.

154
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:22.833
So in one study,
因此在一个研究中，

155
00:07:22.857 --> 00:07:26.144
children whose parents were reading to them daily when they were five
那些父母在孩子五岁时 每天为他们朗读故事

159
00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:41.093
Now, there are huge challenges with interpreting this type of science.
现在，在解释这门科学上 面临很大的挑战。

160
00:07:41.622 --> 00:07:44.277
These studies show that certain things that parents do

161
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:46.663
are correlated with good outcomes for children,
跟孩子以后能有一个好的结果是 相关联的，

162
00:07:46.687 --> 00:07:50.100
but we don't necessarily know those behaviors caused the good outcomes,
但是我们未必知道是 这些行为导致了好的结果

163
00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:52.506
or whether some other factor is getting in the way.
或者是否还有其它的因素 在妨碍这种结果。

164
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.775
For example, we have to take genes into account,
例如，我们需要也考虑基因的影响，

165
00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:56.946
and that's a whole other talk in itself.
但这个它本身就值得另外一个演讲。

166
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.653
But scientists working with this British study
进行这项英国研究的科学家

167
00:07:59.677 --> 00:08:01.843
are working really hard to get at causes,
很努力地在寻找原因，

168
00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:03.888
and this is one study I particularly love.
而这也是我个人特别喜爱的 一个研究。

169
00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:05.094
In this one,
在这个研究中，

170
00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.985
they looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children

171
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:09.801
born at the turn of the millennium.

Were the children going to bed at regular times,

173
00:08:12.178 --> 00:08:15.076
or did they go to bed at different times during the week?
还是在一星期中每天的睡眠时间 都不一样？

174
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.673
The data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times
数据显示那些不按规定时间睡觉的 小孩

175
00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.070
were more likely to have behavioral problems,

176
00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:23.803
and then those that switched to having regular bedtimes

177
00:08:23.827 --> 00:08:26.213
often showed an improvement in behavior,

178
00:08:26.237 --> 00:08:27.593
and that was really crucial,
这真的很重要，

179
00:08:27.617 --> 00:08:29.889
because it suggested it was the bedtime routines
因为它表明睡眠时间规律

180
00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:32.628
that were really helping things get better for those kids.
真的能够帮助这些小孩表现更好。

181
00:08:33.202 --> 00:08:34.823
Here's another one to think about.
这里还有另外一个需要去思考的 研究。

182
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.005
In this one,
在这个研究中，

183
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:38.920
scientists looked at children who were reading for pleasure.
科学家观察了那些 为快乐而阅读的孩子

184
00:08:38.944 --> 00:08:42.997
That means that they picked up a magazine, a picture book, a story book.
也就是说他们经常拿起一本杂志、 画册、故事书。

185
00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:46.520
The data showed that children who were reading for pleasure

186
00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:48.804
at the ages of five and 10

188
00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:53.719
on school tests later in their lives.
在学校的测试成绩也会更好。

189
00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:55.448
And not just tests of reading,
而且不仅仅是阅读方面的测试，

190
00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:57.612
but tests of spelling and maths as well.
还包括过拼写以及数学测试。

191
00:08:58.446 --> 00:09:01.256
This study tried to control for all the confounding factors,
这个研究试图控制所有的干扰因素,

192
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.764
so it looked at children who were equally intelligent
因此它是观察了同等智力水平

193
00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.820
and from the same social-class background,
并来自相同社会阶级背景的小孩，

194
00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:09.227
so it seemed as if it was the reading which really helped those children
所以看起来似乎是阅读 真的帮助了这些孩子

195
00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.394
go on and score better on those school tests later in their lives.

196
00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:14.868
Now at the start,
开始的时候，

197
00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:16.841
I said the first lesson from this study
我说过从这个研究中学到的第一课

198
00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:19.413
was not to be born into poverty or into disadvantage,
是不要出生在一个贫穷落后的家庭。

199
00:09:19.437 --> 00:09:22.989
because those children tend to follow more difficult paths in their lives.
因为这些孩子容易走上一条 更艰难的生活道路。

200
00:09:23.013 --> 00:09:25.250
But then I said that parenting matters,
但是后来我又说了父母很重要，

201
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:27.576
and that good parenting, if you can call it that,
好的养育方式，如果你觉得这就够了，

202
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.936
helps children beat the odds
能帮助孩子打破命运的魔咒

203
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.763
and overcome some of those early disadvantages.
并且克服部分早期的劣势。

204
00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:33.112
So wait,
等一下,

205
00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:36.480
does that actually mean, then, that poverty doesn't matter after all?
这是否就意味着贫穷 只是一件无关紧要的事？

206
00:09:38.157 --> 00:09:41.169
You could argue it doesn't matter if a child is born poor --
你可以说它无关紧要， 如果一个小孩出身贫穷——

207
00:09:41.193 --> 00:09:44.914
as long as their parents are good parents, they're going to do just fine.
只要他们的父母是称职的， 他们也会过得好。

208
00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:46.345
I don't believe that's true.
但是我不相信这种说法。

209
00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:48.880
This study shows that poverty and parenting matter.
研究表明贫穷和养育方式都对孩子 影响很大。

210
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:51.379
And one study actually put figures on that,
事实上有一个研究对此进行了 量化对比，

211
00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:54.102
so it looked at children growing up in persistent poverty

212
00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.195
and how well they were doing at school.

213
00:09:56.537 --> 00:09:57.688
The data showed

214
00:09:57.712 --> 00:10:00.568
that even when their parents were doing everything right --
即便他们的父母正确的做了 每一件事——

215
00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:01.894
putting them to bed on time
督促他们按时睡觉

216
00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:04.355
and reading to them every day and everything else --
每天给他们朗读等等——

217
00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:06.212
that only got those children so far.
也只能帮孩子到这样。

218
00:10:06.551 --> 00:10:09.520
Good parenting only reduced the educational gap
好的育儿方式也只能将 富孩子和穷孩子

219
00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:12.557
between the rich and poor children by about 50 percent.
之间的教育差距缩小一半。

220
00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:17.564
Now that means that poverty leaves a really lasting scar,
那意味着贫穷会留下一个 持续的创伤,

221
00:10:17.588 --> 00:10:20.970
and it means that if we really want to ensure the success and well-being
也意味着如果我们真的想要确保 下一代

222
00:10:20.994 --> 00:10:22.431
of the next generation,
能够成功并且幸福,

223
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:26.343
then tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do.
那么消除儿童贫困就是一件 非常重要的事情。

224
00:10:27.823 --> 00:10:30.211
Now, what does all this mean for you and me?
所有这些对你和我来说 又意味着什么呢？

225
00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:32.665
Are there lessons here we can all take home and use?

226
00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:34.219
As a scientist and a journalist,
作为一个科学家和记者，

227
00:10:34.243 --> 00:10:36.791
I like to have some science to inform my parenting ...
我想用一些科学来报告 我的育儿经验

228
00:10:37.853 --> 00:10:40.610
and I can tell you that when you're shouting at your kids

229
00:10:40.634 --> 00:10:41.894
to go to bed on time,
让他们按时睡觉时，

230
00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:44.950
it really helps to have the scientific literature on your side.
知道科学数据可以帮助你很多。

231
00:10:44.974 --> 00:10:45.993
(Laughter)
（笑声）

232
00:10:46.017 --> 00:10:47.620
And wouldn't it be great to think
如果我们只需要跟孩子交谈、 关心他们的未来

233
00:10:47.644 --> 00:10:50.353
that all we had to do to have happy, successful children
让他们按时睡觉、给他们书去阅读

234
00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:53.076
was to talk to them, be interested in their future,
就能让他们快乐、成功，

235
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.674
put them to bed on time, and give them a book to read?
这难道不是想想就让人很高兴的事吗？

236
00:10:55.698 --> 00:10:56.848
Our job would be done.
我们的工作完成了。

237
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.779
Now, as you can imagine,
正如你能想像得到的，

238
00:10:58.803 --> 00:11:02.012
the answers aren't quite as simple as that.
答案不止这么简单。

239
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.227
For one thing, this study looks at what happens
首先，这项研究调查了

240
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:06.672
to thousands and thousands of children on average,
成千上万的普通小孩，

241
00:11:06.696 --> 00:11:10.294
but that doesn't necessarily say what will help my child or your child

242
00:11:10.318 --> 00:11:12.055
or any individual child.
或任何其他的单个小孩。

243
00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.287
In the end, each of our children is going to walk their own path,
最终，每个小孩都有自己的路要走，

244
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:17.890
and that's partly defined by the genes they inherit
而那条路部分取决于 他们所继承的基因

245
00:11:17.914 --> 00:11:20.915
and of course all the experiences they have through their lives,

246
00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:23.391
including their interactions with us, their parents.

I realized I was so busy working,
我意识到我太忙于工作了，

250
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.549
and ironically,
而讽刺的是，

251
00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:35.157
learning and writing about this incredible study of British children,
在学习和撰写这个关于英国小孩的 伟大研究时，

252
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:38.639
that there were days when I hardly even spoke to my own British children.
有好多天我都难得跟我自己的 英国小孩说话。

253
00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:41.641
So at home, we introduced talking time,

when we talk and listen to the boys.

258
00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:55.568
Of course, I make sure they always have a book to read.

I tell them I'm ambitious for their future,

261
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.732
I don't know that any of that will make a difference,
我不知道我做的这些是否对他们 有影响，

262
00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:07.146
but I'm pretty confident it won't do them any harm,

263
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.901
and it might even do them some good.

listen to our children themselves.

268
00:12:17.648 --> 00:12:18.802
Thank you.
