observing what makes people luckier than others

You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

5
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.140
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

6

7

It looks like it's chance
看起来运气具有偶然性，

12

because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.
是因为我们极少看到所有的 因素同时作用而产生好运。

13
00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.561
But I've realized, by watching so long,

isolated and dramatic.

blowing constantly.

and sometimes it blows in gusts,

We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk

to, next week, someone who does.

we rarely do this.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.427
We sort of lock down the sense of who we are

39
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:06.149
and don't stretch anymore.

40
00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:07.771

where they map out what risks they're willing to take.

that risk-taking is not binary.

一旦确定自己肯承担的风险后，  他们会将风险表与他人的比较，

I then encourage them to stretch,
