00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:13.908
Yet, information access is not the only area in astronomy where this is important.
然而，获取信息并非是天文学唯一重要的部分。

143
00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:16.946
The situation is systemic
目前它们是互相关联的，

144
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.939
and scientific fields are not keeping up.
但科学界对此尚未跟进。

145
00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:23.297
The body is something changeable --
我们的身体是脆弱的——

146
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:26.686
anyone may develop a disability at any point.
任何人在任何时候都有致残的可能。

147
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.948
Let's think about, for example,
试想，例如，

148
00:08:28.972 --> 00:08:31.759
scientists that are already at the top of their careers.
那些在各自领域卓有成就的科学家。

149
00:08:31.783 --> 00:08:34.623
What happens to them if they develop a disability?
当他们残疾时会怎么样？

150
00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.064
Will they feel excommunicated as I did?
他们会和我一样感到孤独无依吗？

151
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.849
Information access empowers us to flourish.
我们通过获取信息得以发展，

152
00:08:41.319 --> 00:08:44.919
It gives us equal opportunities to display our talents

153
00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:47.806
and choose what we want to do with our lives,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.138
based on interest and not based on potential barriers.

155
00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:56.481
When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits,

156
00:08:56.505 --> 00:09:01.063
that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life.
这将会给他们一种自我满足感，进而带来富足的生活。

157
00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:03.520
And I think that the use of sound in astronomy
我认为声音在天文学中的应用

158
00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:07.021
is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.
正帮助我们达成这个目标，并促进科学的发展。

159
00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:12.471
While other countries told me that the study of perception techniques
然而其他国家告知我以研究天文数据为目的的

160
00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:16.072
in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy
感知技术的研究与天文学无关，

161
00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:19.296
because there are no blind astronomers in the field,
因为目前这个领域还没有视障的天文学家，

162
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.724
South Africa said, "We want people with disabilities
南非的表态是，“我们希望残疾人士

163
00:09:22.748 --> 00:09:24.724
to contribute to the field."
可以为这个领域贡献自己的力量。”

164
00:09:24.748 --> 00:09:28.830
Right now, I'm working at the South African Astronomical Observatory,
于是目前，我正在南非天文观测站的

165
00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:31.939
at the Office of Astronomy for Development.
天文学发展性研究办公室工作。

166
00:09:32.256 --> 00:09:36.997
There, we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods
在那里，我们利用超声波处理技术以及分析手段

167
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:40.467
to impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind.
帮助阿斯隆盲人学校的学生。

168
00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:43.909
These students will be learning radio astronomy,

169
00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:47.171
and they will be learning the sonification methods

170
00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:51.666
in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy
来研究天文事件，比如研究从太阳喷射出的巨大能量，

171
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.126
from the sun, known as coronal mass ejections.
就是你们熟知的日冕物质抛射。

172
00:09:55.014 --> 00:09:56.773
What we learn with these students --
我们从这些学生身上学到了——

173
00:09:56.797 --> 00:10:02.494
these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies that will be accommodated --
这些学生罹患多重残疾，但我们有应对的方法——

174
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.357
what we learn with these students will directly impact

175
00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:08.538
the way things are being done at the professional level.

176
00:10:08.562 --> 00:10:10.621
I humbly call this development.
我把它称之为“发展”。

177
00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:12.901
And this is happening right now.
现在，“发展”正在发生。

178
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.548
I think that science is for everyone.

182
00:10:24.776 --> 00:10:29.956
I think that if we limit people with disabilities

183
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:31.820
from participating in science,
不能参与到科学活动中来，

184
00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:35.492
we'll sever our links with history and with society.
历史与社会的桥梁将因此轰塌。

185
00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:38.962
I dream of a level scientific playing field,
