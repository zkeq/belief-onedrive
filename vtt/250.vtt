When I was first asked to do a TED Talk,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.067
I Googled to try and find out a little bit more about,

you know, how it felt to be giving one.

And one of the first things I read was a speaker in the States

6
00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.540
saying that she felt fine until she came onstage,
她说她上台之前自我感觉良好， 但是等她刚上台，

7
00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.608
and then she saw the timer ticking down.

And it reminded her of a bomb.
这让她想到了定时炸弹。

10
00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:40.422
I was thinking, "That's the last thing I need."
我当时在想， “这可不是我想要看到的事情。”

11
00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.434
(Laughter)

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:47.469

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:51.619
I think it's a bit of a joke
不过我觉得，

15
00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.718
for an editor of a paper to choose a photographer to open a speaking event.
让一个文字编辑者来选择摄影师 到这里作演讲实在有点滑稽。

16
00:00:55.742 --> 00:00:56.774
(Laughter)
（笑声）

17
00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:58.671
We're not renowned for our words,

I think we can learn about the world, about other people

and get a better understanding.

As John said, I was a fashion photographer

And storytelling was always something I wanted to do.

to go and photograph other people in their situations

But this didn't happen overnight.

41
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.494
When I worked as a music photographer and a fashion photographer,

42
00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:05.736
I always had this nagging feeling that there was something missing,

43
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.770
that I wasn't quite using my skills productively.

44
00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.962
And it may seem very obvious, the link, now,

45
00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.101
but at the time, I couldn't really work out

46
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:15.580
how could I use my photography to do something useful.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:21.805
I walked away from it completely and decided to do care work.

51

I would give him a 24-hour care,

I realized that his story wasn't being told.

The social services were not particularly good at helping Nick,

而他们说，尼克的自残 不会有我们描述的那么严重。
