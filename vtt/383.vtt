the main sensations I had for every waking hour ...

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.196
If the feeling came as I thought of my dad who recently passed away,
我是否在想起刚去世的爸爸时产生了这感觉，

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.276
or if I could have just definitely avoided the worries and anxieties.

7
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.236
And if you think I'm a little obsessive,

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.116
you're probably right.
你应该是对的。

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.396
But clearly, from this visualization,
但是很明显，从这个画面中，

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.716
you can learn much more about me than from this other one,

which are images you're probably more familiar with

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.396
In my day job, I work with data.

17

I run a data visualization design company,

What my job has taught me over the years

20
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.676
is that to really understand data and their true potential,

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.796
sometimes we actually have to forget about them

22
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.580
and see through them instead.
反而才能识破它们。

23
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.836
Because data are always just a tool we use to represent reality.

24
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.716
They're always used as a placeholder for something else,

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.916
but they are never the real thing.

26
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.876
But let me step back for a moment
但是让我先回溯一下，

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.380
to when I first understood this personally.

I was too young to be interested in politics,

but I knew that a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi,

32
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.140
was running for president for the moderate right.

33
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.956
We lived in a very liberal town,
我们的镇上非常偏向自由党，

34
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.276
and my father was a politician for the Democratic Party.
而且我父亲是民主党的政客。

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.636
And I remember that no one thought that Berlusconi could get elected --

36
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.420
that was totally not an option.

39
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.036
It was a complete surprise,
那是个巨大的意外，

40
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.100
as my dad promised that in my town he knew nobody who voted for him.
因为我爸爸信誓旦旦地说，他知道我们镇上没人投票给他。

41
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.620
This was the first time when the data I had gave me a completely distorted image of reality.
这是第一次我手里的数据反映出的现实是完全错误的。

42
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.340
My data sample was actually pretty limited and skewed,
我的数据样本实际上很有限且有偏向性，

43
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.156
so probably it was because of that, I thought, I lived in a bubble,

44
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780
and I didn't have enough chances to see outside of it.

It looked like we had enough information this time,

51
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.076
and many more chances to see outside the closed circle we lived in --

52
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.420
but we clearly didn't.

53
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.956

I had been there before.

even with the most respected newspaper,

stories of human beings behind these numbers.

a peculiar challenge was presented to my team by this woman.

She came to us with a lot of data,

just like the pundits before the election --

but what is the point of all these numbers?

People are not interested in data for the sake of it,

89
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.635
because numbers are never the point.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.556
So we decided to use data to create a connection between Samantha and all of the people looking at her from below.
所以我们决定用数据在萨曼莎和正从地面看着她的所有人之间建立一个连接。

96
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.756
We designed and developed what we called "Friends in Space,"

a web application that simply lets you say "hello" to Samantha

using Twitter from the ISS.
从国际空间站向我们问候。

104
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.676
This made people see the mission's data from a very different perspective.
这使人们看待任务数据的角度大有不同。

105
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.396
It all suddenly became much more about our human nature and our curiosity,
这一切突然变得更加关乎人性和好奇心，

106
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.076
rather than technology.

108
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.860
but stories of human beings were the drive.
但人类的故事才是背后的驱动力。

109
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.996
The very positive response of its thousands of users

110
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.930
taught me a very important lesson --

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.836
that working with data means designing ways
处理数据意味着设计各种方法，

112
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.596
to transform the abstract and the uncountable
将抽象和无法量化的信息转化成

113
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.956
into something that can be seen, felt and directly reconnected to our lives and to our behaviors,
可以看到、感觉到并与我们的生活和行为直接重新连接的东西，

114
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:59.060
something that is hard to achieve if we let the obsession for the numbers and the technology around them lead us in the process.
而如果我们让对数字的痴迷和围绕数字的技术在这个过程中引领我们，则很难实现这一点。

115
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.316
But we can do even more to connect data to the stories they represent.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.916
and you can see that every little symbol represents all of the times that I checked the time,
你可以看到，每一个小符号代表着我每次看时间，

144
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.316
positioned for days and different hours chronologically --

145
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.380
nothing really complicated here.
没有什么复杂的。

146
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.596
But then you see in the legend
但是再看看这破译说明，

147
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.076
how I added anecdotal details about these moments.
我是如何把这些时刻的各种细节加进去的。

148
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.676
In fact, the different types of symbols indicate why I was checking the time --
实际上，不同类型的符号代表着我为什么要看时间——

149
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.916
what was I doing?
当时我在做什么？

150
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.636
Was I bored? Was I hungry?

151
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.876
Was I late?

152
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.116
Did I check it on purpose or just casually glance at the clock?
我是有意看表还是随意瞥一眼时钟？

153
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.396
And this is the key part --
但关键是——

154
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.076
representing the details of my days and my personality through my data collection.
我的数据收集代表了我的生活细节和个性。

155

157
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.220
even though I'm absolutely always on time.

158
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.116
Stefanie and I spent one year collecting our data manually
斯蒂芬妮和我花了一年时间手动收集我们的数据，

159
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.636
to force us to focus on the nuances that computers cannot gather --

or at least not yet --

161
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.716
using data also to explore our minds and the words we use,

163
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.116
Like at week number three,

164
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.956
where we tracked the "thank yous" we said and were received,

and when I realized that I thank mostly people that I don't know.
它让我意识到，我多数时间在感谢我不认识的人。

166
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.996

显然我对感谢男女服务生有强迫症，

167
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.180
but I definitely don't thank enough the people who are close to me.
但绝对没有对身边的人表达足够的感谢。

168
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.076
Over one year,

169
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.916
the process of actively noticing and counting these types of actions became a ritual.

170
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.996
It actually changed ourselves.

much more aware of our behaviors and our surroundings.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.516
Over one year, Stefanie and I connected at a very deep level through our shared data diary,
一年多的时间，斯蒂芬妮和我通过共享数据日记建立了非常深层的联系，

174
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.836
but we could do this only because we put ourselves in these numbers,
但是我们能做到这样，只因为我们用这些数字表达了自己，

175
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.836
adding the contexts of our very personal stories to them.

176

177
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.540
and representative of ourselves.

178
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.396
I am not asking you to start drawing your personal data,

179
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.276
or to find a pen pal across the ocean.

180
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.876
But I'm asking you to consider data --

181
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.356
all kind of data --
各种数据——

182
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.156
as the beginning of the conversation
看成交谈的开始，

183
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.380
and not the end.
而不是终止。

184
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.076
Because data alone will never give us a solution.
因为数据本身永远不会给我们答案。

185
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.796
And this is why data failed us so badly --
这就是为什么数据让我们败得这么惨——

186
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.676
because we failed to include the right amount of context to represent reality --

187
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.900
a nuanced, complicated and intricate reality.
微妙的、错综复杂的现实。

188
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.236
We kept looking at these two numbers,

189
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.756
obsessing with them

and pretending that our world could be reduced to a couple digits and a horse race,

191
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.916
while the real stories,

192
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.836
the ones that really mattered, were somewhere else.
真正重要的故事在别处。

193
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:14.820
What we missed looking at these stories only through models and algorithms is what I call "data humanism."
如果只用模型和算法来看待这些故事，我们错过的是我所说的“数据人文主义”。

194
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.396
In the Renaissance humanism,
在文艺复兴时期的人文主义中，

195
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.036
European intellectuals

I believe something similar needs to happen with the universe of data.
我相信在数据的世界，也需要类似的事情。

198
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.636
Now data are apparently treated like a God --

199
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.940
keeper of infallible truth for our present and our future.
我们现在和未来的永恒真理持有者。

200
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.556
The experiences that I shared with you today

201
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.596
taught me that to make data faithfully representative of our human nature

202

and to make sure they will not mislead us anymore,

we need to start designing ways

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:56.100
to include empathy, imperfection and human qualities in how we collect, process, analyze and display them.
在收集、处理、分析和演示数据时，纳入同情、不完美和人文素质。

I do see a place where, ultimately,
我能预见，终将有个地方，

206
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.436
instead of using data only to become more efficient,

207
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.260
we will all use data to become more humane.
我们都会用数据来变得更人性化。

208
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.916
Thank you.
谢谢。

209
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.381
