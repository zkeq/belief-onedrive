Working with the poorest of the poor, my father realized

that poverty was more than the lack of income and assets.

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:56.869
People were trapped in poverty,

00:01:56.893 --> 00:02:00.616
because they felt their condition was immutable.

something given to them by God.

For poverty reduction programs to succeed,

a solution to ultra-poverty that addresses both income poverty and the poverty of hope.
这是针对赤贫的解决方案，能同时解决低收入导致的贫穷和希望缺失。

40
00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:29.703
The approach works primarily with women,
这种方法最先针对女性，

41
00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:32.961
because women are the most affected by ultra-poverty

43
00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.157
Over a two-year period,

44
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:41.248
we essentially do four things.

by giving her an asset, like livestock,

这四点中的每一点都是其他各点成功的关键，

56
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:23.422
but the real magic is the hope and sense of possibility the women develop through the close mentorship they receive.
但真正神奇的地方在于她们在接受学习的过程中所感受到的希望和可能性。

57
00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:26.289
