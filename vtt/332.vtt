right before it's about to kick back at you --

before the human ear could pick it up.

77
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.415
(Laughter)
（笑声）

78
00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.230
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.

My unique experience of the world helped inform my solution.

This is an OXO potato peeler.

88
00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:47.328
It was originally designed for people with arthritis,

89
00:05:47.352 --> 00:05:49.779
but it was so comfortable, everybody loved it.
但是它用起来很舒服，所有人都喜欢它。

90
00:05:51.612 --> 00:05:56.018
Text messaging: that was originally designed for people who are Deaf.

92
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.829
(Laughter)
（笑声）

93
00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:02.566
I started thinking:
我开始想：

94
00:06:03.312 --> 00:06:06.438
What if we changed our mindset?
如果我们改变我们的观念模式会怎么样呢？

95
00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:12.526
What if we started designing for disability first --
如果我们首先为残障人士设计

96
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.827
not the norm?
而不是正常人，会怎么样呢？

97
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.331
As you see, when we design for disability first,
正如你所看到的，当我们首先为残障人士设计时，

98
00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:23.176
we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive,

100
00:06:30.218 --> 00:06:31.773
And this excites me,

101
00:06:31.797 --> 00:06:39.746
because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability

can be leveraged, molded and played with

as a force for creativity and innovation.

104
00:06:49.532 --> 00:06:55.065
This moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts

105
00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.212

106
00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:00.954
to becoming an alchemist,

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:15.257
that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers

111

112
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.163
Without knowing it, from a very early age,
我根本不知道，我从很小的时候

113
00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:24.442
I've been a design thinker, fine-tuning my skills.
就已经是一位不断地在磨练自己技能的设计思考者，

114
00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:30.849
Design thinkers are, by nature, problem solvers.
设计思考者天生就是问题解决者。

115
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.705
So imagine listening to a conversation
想象一下，你正在聆听一段对话，

116
00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.722
and only understanding 50 percent of what is said.
而你只能理解 50% 的内容，

117
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.358
You can't ask them to repeat every single word.
你不能要求他们重复每一个单词。

118
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.296
They would just get frustrated with you.

119
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.060
So without even realizing it,
所以在听不懂的情况下，

120
00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:54.996
my solution was to take the muffled sound I heard,
我的解决办法是记住那个我听到的细小的声音，

121
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.172
that was the beat,
也就是说话的节奏，

122
00:07:56.196 --> 00:08:00.706
and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read.
把它变成一种韵律，然后和我看到的唇形匹配。

123
00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:07.401
Years later, someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it.
很多年以后，有人评论道，我的写作中包含着一种韵律。

124
00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:12.886
Well, this is because I experience conversations as rhythms.
嗯，那是因为我是用韵律在体会对话。

125
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:19.264
I also became really, really good at failing.
我也变得很擅长不及格。

126
00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:20.522
(Laughter)
（笑声）

127
00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:22.120
Quite literally.
真的是这样的。

128
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:25.702
My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.
我第一学期的西班牙语课成绩是D。

129
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:30.203
But what I learned was that when I picked myself up

130
00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:32.527
and changed a few things around,
并重新调整过后，

131
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:35.366
eventually, I succeeded.
最后还是可以成功的。

132
00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:41.627
Similarly, design thinking encourages people to fail
同样地，设计思考鼓励人们失败，

133
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.287
and fail often,
并且经常失败，

134
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:46.542
because eventually, you will succeed.
因为最终，你会成功的。

135
00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:54.946
Very few great innovations in this world have come from someone succeeding on the first try.
世上很少伟大的发明创新第一次就能成功。

136
00:08:56.726 --> 00:08:59.598
I also experienced this lesson in sports.
我也在体育运动中学到了这个教训。

137
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.241
I'll never forget my coach saying to my mom,
我永远都不会忘记我的教练对我妈妈说，

138
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:08.443
"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,

139
00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:10.151
she would be on the national team."
她将会入选国家队。”

140
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:16.062
But what my coach, and what I didn't even know at the time,
但是我和我的教练在那个时候不知道的是

141
00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:21.543
was that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports.
其实我失去听力，反倒帮助我擅长于运动。

142
00:09:22.524 --> 00:09:27.591
You see, when you lose your hearing, not only do you adapt your behavior,
要知道，当你失去听觉的时候，你不单要调适你的行为，

143
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.397
but you also adapt your physical senses.
你也要调适你的感官。

144
00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.255
One example of this
举个例子，

145
00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:38.782
is that my visual attention span increased.
我的视觉专注范围增加了。

146
00:09:39.363 --> 00:09:43.821
Imagine a soccer player, coming down the left flank.
