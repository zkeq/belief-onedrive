where I would become interested in an area

and I would dive in, become all-consumed,

24
00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:24.795
and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was,

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.583
But then I would become interested in something else,

something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that,

认真钻研，然后说， “太棒了！这就是我的菜！”

The first was that I wasn't sure

how I was going to turn any of this into a career.

you learned it from the culture.

when we're about five years old.

posed to little kids to elicit cute replies,

80
00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:17.750
it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be.

81
00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:20.172
In fact, it does just the opposite,
恰恰相反，它限制了小朋友想象的自由，

82
00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:23.212
because when someone asks you what you want to be,

you can't reply with 20 different things,

116
00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:12.492
It might help if you break it up into three parts:
