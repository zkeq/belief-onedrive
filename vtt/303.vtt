1
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.851
You've heard of your IQ, your general intelligence,
你一定听说过智商，也就是普通智力，

2
00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.565
but what's your Psy-Q?
但什么是心理商？

3
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.795
How much do you know about what makes you tick,
你对自己的行为和性格了解多少，

4
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.578
and how good are you at predicting other people's behavior
你能准确地预测他人行为，

5
00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:23.847
or even your own?
或你自己的行为吗？

6
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.996
And how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong?
你对心理学的认知有多少是错的？

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.370
Let's find out by counting down the top myths of psychology.
让我们来了解一下心理学中几个主要的错误观念。

8
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.282
You've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology,
你可能听过这本书，里面的观点做了

9
00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:36.364
it's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
男人来自火星，女人来自金星的比喻。

10
00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:38.553
But how different are men and women, really?
但男人和女人间究竟有多大的差异？

11
00:00:38.553 --> 00:00:41.106
To find out, let's start by looking at something
为了找到答案，让我们看看男女

12
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.556
on which men and women really do differ
在哪些方面存在明显的差别，

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.857
and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale.
然后再把这些心理学上的性别差异在同一张图上表现出来。

14
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.517
One thing men and women do really differ on is how far they can throw a ball.
那么男女差异的其中一项是扔球距离的远近。

15
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.434
So if we look at the data for men here,
先看一下男性的数据。

16
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:54.925
we see what is called a normal distribution curve.
我们看到一条所谓的标准分布曲线。

17
00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.035
A few men can throw a ball really far, a few men, not far at all,
有些男性可以把球扔很远，有些男性却稍逊一点，

18
00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.805
but most, a kind of average distance.
但大多数都在平均距离附近。

19
00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:02.043
And women share the same distribution as well,
女性的表现也呈现了相同的分布曲线，

20
00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:03.552
but actually, there's quite a big difference.
但实际上却存在相当大的差异。

21
00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:06.003
In fact, the average man can throw a ball further
事实上，男性平均来说可以把球扔得更远，

22
00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:08.416
than about 98 percent of all women.
超过了98％的女性。

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.866
Now let's look at what some psychological gender differences look like
那么现在我们来看看男女在心理上的一些差别，

24
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.399
on the same standardized scale.
还是以同样的标准来比较。

25
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.886
Any psychologist will tell you
任何心理学家都会告诉你

26
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.481
that men are better at spatial awareness than women --
男人比女人的空间感更好——

27
00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:21.086
things like map-reading, for example -- and it's true.
例如阅读地图——这的确是事实，

28
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.327
But let's have a look at the size of this difference.
不过让我们看看这种差异到底有多大。

29
00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:26.794
It's tiny; the lines are so close together, they almost overlap.
差异非常小, 两条曲线如此接近，近乎重叠。

30
00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:30.622
In fact, the average woman is better than 33 percent of all men,
事实上，女性平均来说比33％的男性的表现要好，

31
00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.758
and of course, if that was 50 percent,
当然，如果这百分比是50％，

32
00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:34.993
then the two genders would be exactly equal.
那么，男性和女性的表现就是完全相同的。

33
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.112
It's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you
请记住这种差异，我马上要说的下一个例子

34
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:42.822
are pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences ever discovered in psychology.
几乎是心理学迄今为止发现的男女心理上的最大差异。

35
00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:43.878
Here's the next one.
就是这个。

36
00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:45.387
Any psychologist will tell you
任何心理学家都会告诉你

37
00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:48.106
that women are better with language and grammar than men.
女性在语言和语法方面比男性更好。

38
00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:51.267
Here's performance on the standardized grammar test.
这种差异表现在标准化语法测试上。

39
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.385
There, the women. There go the men.
这是女性曲线（紫色），这是男性曲线（青色）。

40
00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:54.589
Again, yes, women are better on average,
没错，平均来说女性的表现的确更好，

41
00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.236
but the lines are so close
但两条曲线依然很接近，

42
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.318
that 33 percent of men are better than the average woman.
33％的男性表现超过了女性平均值，

43
00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:00.942
And again, if it was 50 percent,
同样，如果这百分比是50％，

44
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:03.743
that would represent complete gender equality.
那就意味着两个性别间并不存在差异。

45
00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.244
So it's not really a case of Mars and Venus.
因此，这不是火星和金星的对比，

46
00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:08.817
It's more a case of, if anything, Mars and Snickers:
它更像巧克力棒Mars和Snickers的差别，

47
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:12.506
basically the same, but one's maybe slightly nuttier than the other.
二者基本相同，但一种可能比另一种的坚果更多。

48
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.296
When making a cake, do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures?
下面请做蛋糕的时候更习惯使用带图片的食谱书的观众举起手。

49
00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:18.271
Yeah, a few people.
好的，有一些人举手了。

50
00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:20.053
Have a friend talk you through?
哪些人需要朋友的指导？

51
00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:23.086
Or have a go, making it up as you go along?
有没有人会自己尝试去凑合做一个？

52
00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:25.096
Quite a few people there.
还是有不少人举手了。

53
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.648
OK, so if you said A,
好的，如果你选了A，

54
00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.159
then this means that you're a visual learner,
这意味着你是一个视觉学习者，

55
00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:32.454
and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style.
当信息以视觉的形式呈现，你的学习效果最好。

56
00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.128
If you said B, it means you're an auditory learner,
如果你选B，这说明你是一个听觉学习者，

57
00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:38.926
that you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format.
通过听觉信息可以达到最好的学习效果。

58
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.857
And if you said C, it means that you're a kinesthetic learner,
如果你选C，这意味者你是一个动觉学习者，

59
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.270
that you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands.
直接动手实践会学得最快。

60
00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.680
Except, of course, as you've probably guessed,
当然你可能已经猜到，

61
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.612
that it doesn't, because the whole thing is a complete myth.
这样的结论不太可靠，因为整个学习过程要比这复杂得多。

62
00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:54.226
Learning styles are made up and are not supported by scientific evidence.
这种学习方式只是人为定义的，并没有科学证据的支持。

63
00:02:54.102 --> 00:02:57.522
We know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies
我们了解到这些，是因为在严格对照的实验研究里，

64
00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.716
when learners are given material to learn,
给学习者提供的学习资料

65
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.369
either in their preferred style or an opposite style,
要么是他们喜欢的学习方式，要么就是他们不喜欢的，

66
00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:06.058
it makes no difference at all to the amount of information they retain.
事实证明，他们所掌握的信息数量完全没有区别。

67
00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:08.148
And if you think about it for just a second,
如果你仔细思考一下，

68
00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:09.843
it's obvious that this has to be true.
很明显，这是毋庸置疑的。

69
00:03:09.843 --> 00:03:14.457
It's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you,
最好的呈现方式并不取决于你，

70
00:03:14.453 --> 00:03:16.143
but on what you're trying to learn.
而取决于你尝试学习的东西。

71
00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:20.819
Could you learn to drive a car, for example, just by listening to someone telling you what to do,
例如，你学开车的时候，只是通过听别人口头传授，

72
00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:22.328
with no kinesthetic experience?
而不需要任何动觉的经验吗？

73
00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:27.274
Could you solve simultaneous equations by talking them through in your head, without writing them down?
你在解联立方程的时候，只是通过单纯的大脑思考，而不用把它们写下来吗？

74
00:03:27.298 --> 00:03:30.577
Could you revise for your architecture exams using interpretive dance
如果你是一个动觉学习者，在复习建筑学考试的时候

75
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:32.148
if you're a kinesthetic learner?
能使用诠释性的舞蹈吗？

76
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.692
No; what you need to do is match the material to be learned
当然不行，你需要做的是将需要学习的材料

77
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.298
to the presentation format,
与它表现的形式相匹配，

78
00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:37.639
not you.
而不是与你习惯的方式。

79
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.720
I know many of you are A-level students
我知道许多在座的人是优等生，

80
00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:43.035
that will have recently gotten your GCSE results.
最近刚拿到你的GCSE（中等教育普通证书）的结果。

81
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.310
And if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for,
如果你没有得到预期的成绩，

82
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.852
then you can't really blame your learning style.
你真的不能责怪你的学习方式，

83
00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:51.311
But one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes.
但你也许可以考虑责怪的事情之一就是你的基因。

84
00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:55.234
So what this is all about is that a recent study at University College London
伦敦大学学院最近做了一项研究，

85
00:03:55.258 --> 00:04:02.710
found that 58 percent of the variation between different students and their GCSE results was down to genetic factors.
发现在不同学生和他们的GCSE成绩之间有58%的差异来自遗传因素。

86
00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:06.031
That sounds like a very precise figure. So how can we tell?
这听起来是一个精确的数字，我们是怎么得到它的呢？

87
00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:11.385
Well, when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment,
当我们想解开关于基因和环境在这方面的影响问题，

88
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:13.432
what we can do is a twin study.
我们可以做双胞胎研究。

89
00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:19.206
Identical twins share 100 percent of their environment and 100 percent of their genes,
同卵双胞胎有完全相同的生长环境以及完全相同的基因，

90
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.676
whereas nonidentical twins share 100 percent of their environment,
然而，异卵双胞胎有完全相同的生长环境，

91
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.250
but just like any brother and sister, share only 50 percent of their genes.
但像任何兄弟姐妹一样，只有一半的基因相同。

92
00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:32.660
So by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins versus nonidentical twins
因此，通过比较同卵双胞胎与异卵双胞胎的GCSE成绩，

93
00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:34.060
and doing some clever maths,
做一些巧妙的计算后，

94
00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:38.029
we can get an idea of how much variation in performance is due to the environment,
我们就可以知道有多少表现的差异来自环境，

95
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.762
and how much is due to genes.
有多少是受基因的影响。

96
00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:43.210
And it turns out that it's about 58 percent due to genes.
而结果证明，约58％的差异是基因导致的。

97
00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:47.729
This isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in.
所以，并不是说你和老师们的辛苦付出没起到什么作用。

98
00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.892
If you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for,
如果你没有得到预期的GCSE成绩，

99
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:53.038
then you can always try blaming your parents,
那么你可以尝试去埋怨你的父母，

100
00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:54.612
or at least their genes.
或至少他们的基因。

101
00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.857
One thing that you shouldn't blame
有一件你不应该去埋怨的事情，

102
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:59.429
is being a left-brained or right-brained learner,
是关于左脑学习者或右脑学习者，

103
00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:01.389
because again, this is a myth.
因为，这同样也是个错误观念。

104
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:04.680
The myth here is that the left brain is logical,
它的主要观点是，左脑是主管逻辑，

105
00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.393
it's good with equations like this,
擅于解方程式，

106
00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:10.049
and the right brain is more creative, so the right brain is better at music.
而右脑更富有创意，在音乐方面表现更佳。

107
00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.835
But again, this is a myth,
但同样，这是一个错误观念，

108
00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:12.901
because nearly everything you do
因为你所做的每件事情

109
00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.636
involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together,
几乎都牵涉到你大脑所有部位的相互沟通，

110
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.956
even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation.
就算是最平凡的日常对话也是如此。

111
00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:22.389
However, perhaps one reason why this myth has survived
然而，这个错误观念至今仍然盛行的一个原因可能是，

112
00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:24.781
is that there is a slight grain of truth to it.
这里包含着小部分事实。

113
00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:29.813
A related version of the myth is that left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people,
它的另一个说法是，左撇子比右撇子更有创造力，

114
00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:33.270
which kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hand.
这种说法有点道理，因为你的大脑控制相反的手，

115
00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:37.943
So in left-handed people, the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the left side of the brain,
因此，左撇子的右脑比左脑更加活跃一点，

116
00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.155
and the idea is the right-hand side is more creative.
而恰恰是右脑更有创造力。

117
00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:45.860
Now, it isn't true per se that left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people.
然而，这个左撇子比右撇子更有创造力的观念本身并不太站得住脚。

118
00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:48.174
But what is true is that ambidextrous people,
事实上，双手灵巧的人

119
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.860
or people who use both hands for different tasks,
或两手并用的人，

120
00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:54.639
are more creative thinkers than one-handed people,
比单手使用者更富有创意，

121
00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:56.430
because being ambidextrous involves
因为双手使用者需要

122
00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:59.146
having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot,
让大脑两侧进行大量的互动和沟通，

123
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.926
which seems to be involved in creative and flexible thinking.
这似乎与有创造性，灵活的思维相关。

124
00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:05.764
The myth of the creative left-hander arises from the fact
左撇子更有创意的错误观念

125
00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:09.830
that being ambidextrous is more common amongst left-handers than right-handers,
源自善用双手者在左撇子中比右撇子中更常见这一事实，

126
00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:12.960
so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left-hander,
所以说，左撇子更有创意这个说法有些道理，

127
00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:14.247
but not much.
但并不完全正确。

128
00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:16.878
A related myth that you've probably heard of
另一个相关的错误观念你或许听过，

129
00:06:16.902 --> 00:06:19.194
is that we only use 10 percent of our brains.
我们开发了大脑的10％的潜能。

130
00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:20.794
This is, again, a complete myth.
这也是一个完全错误的观念。

131
00:06:20.818 --> 00:06:23.558
Nearly everything that we do, even the most mundane thing,
我们所做的每件事情，即使是最平凡的小事，

132
00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:25.434
uses nearly all of our brains.
都会使用到几乎整个大脑。

133
00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:29.054
That said, it is of course true
然而，我们大多数人不能

134
00:06:29.078 --> 00:06:33.634
that most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could.
有效地运用大脑的说法的确是真的。

135
00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.548
So what could we do to boost our brainpower?
那么我们要怎样充分调动大脑的潜能呢？

136
00:06:36.572 --> 00:06:38.827
Maybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart.
或许我们可以听一段莫扎特的音乐。

137
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:41.456
Have you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect?
你们听说过莫扎特效应吗？

138
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.413
The idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter
它说的是听莫扎特的音乐会使你更聪明，

139
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.997
and improves your performance on IQ tests.
并能提升你在智商测验中的表现。

140
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.432
Now again, what's interesting about this myth
它的有趣之处在于，

141
00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:52.272
is that although it's basically a myth, there is a grain of truth to it.
虽然这基本上也是个错误观念，但多少也有些可取之处。

142
00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.152
So the original study found that
最初的研究发现

143
00:06:54.928 --> 00:06:58.322
participants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes
听过几分钟莫扎特音乐的参与者

144
00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:00.220
did better on a subsequent IQ test
在随后的智商测验中的表现

145
00:07:00.244 --> 00:07:03.395
than participants who simply sat in silence.
比只是静静坐着的参与者要好。

146
00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.456
But a follow-up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music
但一项后续研究，招募了一些喜欢莫扎特音乐的人

147
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.037
and then another group of people
以及另外一组

148
00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:11.547
who were fans of the horror stories of Stephen King.
喜欢Stephen King的恐怖故事的人。

149
00:07:11.592 --> 00:07:15.311
And they played the people the music or the stories.
参与者都需要听音乐或听故事。

150
00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:17.820
The people who preferred Mozart music to the stories
更喜欢听莫扎特音乐的人比爱听故事的人

151
00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:20.627
got a bigger IQ boost from the Mozart than the stories,
在听过莫扎特音乐后表现出了更高的智商，

152
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:23.488
but the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music
但对于更喜欢听故事的人来说，

153
00:07:23.512 --> 00:07:27.856
got a bigger IQ boost from listening to the Stephen King stories than the Mozart music.
听Stephen King的故事，相比听莫扎特的音乐，会让他们的智商呈现更显著的增长。

154
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.628
So the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy
那么事实就是，当你在听喜欢的东西时，

155
00:07:30.652 --> 00:07:35.472
perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary IQ boost on a narrow range of tasks.
会使你振作一点，让你在有限的工作中会表现出暂时的智商增长。

156
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.840
There's no suggestion that listening to Mozart,
不过并没有证据表明听莫扎特音乐，

157
00:07:37.864 --> 00:07:42.575
or indeed Stephen King stories, is going to make you any smarter in the long run.
或听Stephen King的故事会让你彻底变得更聪明。

158
00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:45.733
Another version of the Mozart myth
另一个关于莫扎特的错误观念

159
00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:50.806
is that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier, too.
是听莫扎特音乐，不仅让你变聪明，而且会更健康。

160
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:53.385
Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be true
可惜的是，这对于几乎每天听

161
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:56.295
of someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day,
莫扎特音乐的人来说，并不是那么回事儿。

162
00:07:56.454 --> 00:07:57.616
Mozart himself,
莫扎特本身就曾饱受

163
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.795
who suffered from gonorrhea, smallpox, arthritis,
淋病，天花，关节炎的折磨，

164
00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.885
and, what most people think eventually killed him in the end, syphilis.
不过人们认为最终导致他死亡的是梅毒。

165
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:11.236
This suggests that Mozart should have been a bit more careful, perhaps, when choosing his sexual partners.
这表示，也许莫扎特在选择他的性伴侣时应该要更小心。

166
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.133
But how do we choose a partner?
但是，我们该如何选择另一半呢？

167
00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:18.416
So a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists
还有一个时常被社会学家提到的观念，

168
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.984
is that our preferences in a romantic partner are a product of our culture,
那就是我们对于恋爱对象的偏好是一种文化下的产物，

169
00:08:22.008 --> 00:08:23.871
that they're very culturally specific.
具有文化特定性。

170
00:08:23.895 --> 00:08:26.146
But in fact, the data don't back this up.
但实际上，数据分析的结果并不支持这种看法。

171
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.221
A famous study surveyed people from [37] different cultures across the globe
有一项知名的研究，对来自全球37个不同文化背景的人进行了调查，

172
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:31.660
from Americans to Zulus,
从美洲人到南非祖鲁部落人，

173
00:08:31.684 --> 00:08:33.716
on what they look for in a partner.
关于他们如何择偶。

174
00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.265
And in every single culture across the globe,
而在全世界任何一个文化中，

175
00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:41.356
men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner than did women,
男性都会比女性更多的注重另一半的外表，

176
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.969
and in every single culture, too,
同样在任何一个文化中，

177
00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:47.815
women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power.
女性都比男性更重视另一半的事业心和经济能力。

178
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:49.077
In every culture, too,
另外，在任何一个文化中，

179
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.616
men preferred women who were younger than themselves,
男性更喜欢比自己年轻的女性，

180
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.637
an average of, I think it was 2.66 years.
我记得平均要年轻2.66岁，

181
00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:56.110
And in every culture, too,
同样在任何文化中，

182
00:08:56.134 --> 00:08:58.719
women preferred men who were older than them,
女性都更喜欢比她们年纪大的男性，

183
00:08:58.743 --> 00:09:01.486
so an average of 3.42 years,
平均年长3.42岁，

184
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.623
which is why we've got here, "Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."
这就是为什么人们常说“每个人（女性）都需要傍大款。”

185
00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:05.647
(Laughter)
（笑声）

186
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.970
So moving on from trying to score with a partner
那么，把话题从找到理想伴侣转到

187
00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:11.657
to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is.
如何在篮球或足球等运动中得分吧。

188
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:15.813
The myth here is that sportsmen go through "hot hand" streaks, Americans call them,
这个说法是，运动员会经历美国人称为的热手时期，

189
00:09:15.837 --> 00:09:18.141
or "purple patches," we sometimes say in England,
或英国人说的紫色时期，

190
00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:20.673
where they just can't miss, like this guy here.
像这家伙一样，在球场上百发百中。

191
00:09:20.697 --> 00:09:26.226
But in fact, what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically,
但事实上，如果你对这些得分和丢分进行统计分析，

192
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.681
it turns out that it's nearly always at random.
你会发现这几乎都是随机的。

193
00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:31.050
Your brain creates patterns from the randomness.
你的大脑会从随机事件中总结出规律。

194
00:09:30.976 --> 00:09:32.541
If you toss a coin,
比如你抛硬币，

195
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:36.413
a streak of heads or tails is going to come out somewhere in the randomness,
会随机出现正面或反面两种可能，

196
00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:39.570
and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none,
因为大脑喜欢从随机中找出模式来，

197
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.583
we look at these streaks and attribute meaning to them
我们会为这些随机事件人为加上某种意义，

198
00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:43.470
and say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"
说：“是啊，他今天状态很好。”

199
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.375
whereas actually you would get the same pattern
但如果你只是随机的得分和丢分，

200
00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.584
if you were just getting hits and misses at random.
实际上还是会获得相同的数据分布模式。

201
00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:53.565
An exception to this, however, is penalty shootouts.
但是罚球是一个例外。

202
00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:56.510
A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football
最近一项关于足球运动中罚点球的研究发现，

203
00:09:56.534 --> 00:10:00.962
showed that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts,
那些罚点球记录很糟糕的国家队中的球员，

204
00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:03.145
like, for example, England,
例如，在英国队，

205
00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:07.056
tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record,
相比罚球记录较好国家的球员更急于射门得分，

206
00:10:06.882 --> 00:10:10.685
and presumably as a result, they're more likely to miss.
结果看起来就好像他们比较容易罚球失误。

207
00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:12.530
Which raises the question
这又带出了一个问题，

208
00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:15.583
of if there's any way we could improve people's performance.
有什么方法可以改善人们的表现。

209
00:10:15.607 --> 00:10:17.583
And one thing you might think about doing
你可能会想做这样一件事，

210
00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:20.992
is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them.
惩罚有失误的人，看这样是否能提高他们表现。

211
00:10:20.943 --> 00:10:24.543
This idea, the effect that punishment can improve performance,
这个关于惩罚可以提升表现的看法，

212
00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:26.791
was what participants thought they were testing
正是Milgram著名的学习和惩罚实验中的

213
00:10:26.815 --> 00:10:29.415
in Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment
参与者认为他们所测试的对象，

214
00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:32.447
that you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student.
如果你是一个心理学系的学生，你可能听说过这个实验。

215
00:10:32.471 --> 00:10:35.014
The story goes that participants were prepared to give
具体过程是这样的，当一部分参与者答错了问题时，

216
00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:38.287
what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant
另一部分参与者就要对他们实施

217
00:10:38.358 --> 00:10:40.395
when they got a question wrong,
提前被告知会致命的电击，

218
00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:43.150
just because someone in a white coat told them to.
就因为某个穿着白大褂的人告诉他们这样做。

219
00:10:43.174 --> 00:10:45.473
But this story is a myth for three reasons.
但这个故事疑点重重，原因有三个。

220
00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:50.377
Firstly, and most crucially, the lab coat wasn't white. It was, in fact, grey.
第一个，也是最关键的，实验外套不是白色，而是灰色。

221
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:55.138
Secondly, the participants were told before the study
其次，在研究进行之前，参与者会被告知

222
00:10:55.162 --> 00:10:57.505
and reminded any time they raised a concern,
并在实验中一直被提醒，

223
00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.248
that although the shocks were painful, they were not fatal
虽然电击会引起疼痛，但并不是致命的，

224
00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:03.228
and indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever.
也不会引起永久的伤害，等等。

225
00:11:03.252 --> 00:11:05.618
And thirdly, participants didn't give the shocks
第三，参与者没有因为穿实验服的人

226
00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:08.440
just because someone in the coat told them to.
让他们实施电击，就真的这样做了。

227
00:11:08.464 --> 00:11:10.469
When they were interviewed after the study,
在实验结束后的采访中，

228
00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.470
all the participants said that they firmly believed
所有参与者都说，他们坚定地认为

229
00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:16.457
that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose
学习和惩罚的研究很有科学价值，

230
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.606
which would have enduring gains for science,
虽然会给予参与者短暂的，非致命的不适感，

231
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.773
as opposed to the momentary, nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants.
但能让科学领域获得长远的收获。

232
00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:28.539
OK, so I've been talking for about 12 minutes now,
好了，我已经讲了差不多12分钟，

233
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.152
and you've probably been sitting there listening to me,
你们可能一直在那里听我讲，

234
00:11:30.873 --> 00:11:32.819
analyzing my speech patterns and body language
分析我讲话的模式和身体语言，

235
00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.552
and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying,
并试图记住我说过的一些话，

236
00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:39.320
whether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying.
并分辨它们究竟是事实，还是我在撒谎，

237
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:41.432
But if so, you've probably completely failed,
如果你这样做的话，你大概没得出什么正确结论，

238
00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:43.800
because although we all think we can catch a liar
因为，虽然我们认为，能够通过身体语言和说话方式

239
00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:46.002
from their body language and speech patterns,
来判断一个人是不是在说谎，

240
00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:48.820
hundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown that all of us,
但是多年来的数百个心理学研究却发现我们所有的人，

241
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.922
including police officers and detectives,
包括警察和侦探，

242
00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:54.206
are basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language
当想要透过说话者的身体语言和说话方式来测谎时，

243
00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:55.929
and verbal patterns.
其实都是在碰运气。

244
00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:58.177
Interestingly, there is one exception:
有趣的是，有一个例外：

245
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.299
TV appeals for missing relatives.
当电视上有人呼吁寻找失踪的亲人，

246
00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:03.438
It's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing
我们很容易就能判断亲人是真的失踪了，

247
00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:06.891
and when the appealers have, in fact, murdered the relatives themselves.
还是发出呼吁的人已经谋杀了自己的亲人。

248
00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:10.457
So hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads, to look away,
说谎的呼吁者更可能会摇头，目光游移不定，

249
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:12.184
and to make errors in their speech,
而且他们的言辞中错误频频；

250
00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:16.553
whereas genuine appealers are more likely to express hope that the person will return safely
相反，真正的呼吁人通常更会表达对失踪者安全归来的期待，

251
00:12:16.577 --> 00:12:17.996
and to avoid brutal language.
并避免使用极端的语言。

252
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.502
So, for example, they might say "taken from us" rather than "killed."
例如，他们可能会说“离开了我们”，而不是“被杀害了”。

253
00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:25.437
Speaking of which, it's about time I killed this talk,
说到这里，差不多该结束这次演讲了，

254
00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:28.413
but before I do, I just want to give you, in 30 seconds,
不过在结束以前，我想用30秒来总结一下

255
00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:31.784
the overarching myth of psychology.
关于心理学总体的一个错误观念。

256
00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:36.462
The myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories,
这个观念是，心理学只是对有趣理论的收集，

257
00:12:36.486 --> 00:12:40.054
all of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer.
只是提供一些实用的，指导性的理论而已。

258
00:12:39.844 --> 00:12:42.142
What I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes
在刚才的演讲中我希望已经让你们知道了，

259
00:12:42.593 --> 00:12:43.884
is that this isn't true.
这种说法并不正确。

260
00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:47.301
What we need to do is assess psychological theories
我们需要做的是，通过心理学所做的预测

261
00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:49.131
by seeing what predictions they make,
来评估这些心理学理论，

262
00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:51.932
whether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter,
无论是听莫扎特音乐能让你更聪明，

263
00:12:51.956 --> 00:12:56.417
that you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style
还是当信息以你较喜欢的学习模式呈现出来，你会学得更好，

264
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.616
or whatever it is,
或者类似的预测，

265
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.185
all of these are testable empirical predictions,
所有这些都是可检验的以经验为依据的预测，

266
00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:02.020
and the only way we can make progress
我们唯一能取得进展的方式就是

267
00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:06.305
