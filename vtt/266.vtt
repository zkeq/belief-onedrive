00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:15.091
The child's symptoms begin
这个患儿的症状首先是

2
00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.752
with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,
低烧、头痛和肌肉痛，

3
00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:20.863
followed by vomiting and diarrhea,
之后出现呕吐和腹泻，

4
00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:24.987
then bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums.
后来口、鼻和牙龈开始出血，

5
00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:30.920
Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.
最终由于低血压引起器官衰竭，导致死亡

6
00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:32.904
Sounds familiar?
是不是听起来很熟悉？

7
00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:36.011
If you're thinking this is Ebola,
如果你觉得这会不会是埃博拉，

8
00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.912
actually, in this case, it's not.
实际上，就本例来说并不是。

9
00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:43.751
It's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease
本例是登革热的极端形式，这是一种通过蚊子传播的疾病，

10
00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:47.836
which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine,
它也没有有效的治疗方法或疫苗，

11
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.119
and kills 22,000 people each year.
并且每年杀死2.2万人。

12
00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:56.767
That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola
其实，这一数字相当于埃博拉病毒，

13
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.530
in the nearly four decades that we've known about it.
在自我们知道它以来的近40年里，所杀死的人数的两倍

14
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.259
As for measles, so much in the news recently,
而近期新闻中频繁提到的麻疹

15
00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:08.105
the death toll is actually tenfold higher.
死亡人数实际上是登革热的十倍之多。

16
00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:11.169
Yet for the last year,
然而在去年，

17
00:01:11.193 --> 00:01:15.934
it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.
占据所有头条，引起所有恐慌的却是埃博拉。

18
00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.676
Clearly, there is something deeply rooted about it,
显然，有某种东西深深地根植其中，

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.579
something which scares us and fascinates us
这种东西让我们如此害怕，成为了挥之不去的阴影，

20
00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:24.175
more than other diseases.
没有其它疾病能做到这一点。

21
00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:26.310
But what is it, exactly?
而它到底是什么呢？

22
00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:29.406
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,
其实，得上埃博拉是很不容易的，

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.907
but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high.
但如果真的患病，以可怕的死状离去，是极有可能的。

24
00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:34.669
Why?
为什么？

25
00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:39.509
Because right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.
因为现在我们没有任何有效的治疗方法或疫苗可用。

26
00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:42.096
And so, that's the clue.
所以，这就是原因。

27
00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:44.472
We may have it someday.
可能我们终将研制出来。

28
00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:48.600
So we rightfully fear Ebola,
所以我们害怕埃博拉，是合情合理的，

29
00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:53.042
because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases.
因为它杀死的人没有其它疾病那么多，

30
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:59.066
In fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles.
实际上，它的传染性比流感和麻疹之类的病毒，低多了。

31
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.908
We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it.
我们害怕埃博拉是因为这一事实：它能杀死我们，我们却无能为力。

32
00:02:04.932 --> 00:02:08.320
We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola.
我们害怕伴随埃博拉而来的某种不可避免性。

33
00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:13.922
Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.
埃博拉的这种不可避免性似乎是在挑战现代医学。

34
00:02:14.327 --> 00:02:16.081
But wait a second, why is that?
等一下，为什么会这样？

35
00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:19.427
We've known about Ebola since 1976.
从1976年起我们就知道埃博拉了，

36
00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:21.928
We've known what it's capable of.
我们知道它有多厉害，

37
00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:24.582
We've had ample opportunity to study it
我们也有足够的机会来研究它，

38
00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:26.994
in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.
因为一共出现了24起爆发的病例。

39
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:31.787
And in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now
而实际上，现在我们手上已经有了候选疫苗，

40
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:33.168
for more than a decade.
在十多年前就有了。

41
00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:38.115
Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?
那为什么这些疫苗到现在才进行临床实验？

42
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.584
This goes to the fundamental problem we have
这就遇到了研制感染性疾病的疫苗时

43
00:02:41.608 --> 00:02:44.612
with vaccine development for infectious diseases.
面临的根本问题。

44
00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:46.776
It goes something like this:
大致情况是这样：

45
00:02:47.803 --> 00:02:50.606
The people most at risk for these diseases
患上这些疾病风险最高的人

46
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.789
are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines.
也是最无力支付疫苗的一群人。

47
00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:59.077
This leaves little in the way of market incentives
这就导致几乎没有市场动力

48
00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:02.065
for manufacturers to develop vaccines,
来推动生产商研制疫苗，

49
00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:06.809
unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries.
除非在富国有大量人群面临风险。

50
00:03:07.342 --> 00:03:09.722
It's simply too commercially risky.
简单来说，商业风险过高。

51
00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:15.228
As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all,
至于埃博拉，则完全没有市场，

52
00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:20.880
so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now,
所以，如今我们能有两种疫苗进入后期临床实验，

53
00:03:20.904 --> 00:03:23.568
is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear.
唯一的原因是，有点被误导的恐惧。

54
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.564
Ebola was relatively ignored
相对来说，埃博拉一直以来被忽视了，

55
00:03:27.588 --> 00:03:32.129
until September 11 and the anthrax attacks,
直到911和炭疽袭击，

56
00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:34.687
when all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola
突然之间，人们意识到

57
00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:36.884
as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.
埃博拉是一种潜在的，具有生物恐怖袭击性的武器。

58
00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:41.427
Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point?
为什么这时埃博拉疫苗还没有完全研制出来？

59
00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.583
Well, partially, because it was really difficult --
部分是因为非常困难--

60
00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:47.256
or thought to be difficult -- to weaponize the virus,
或者说觉得很困难--来使病毒武器化。

61
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.405
but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it.
但主要原因是研制疫苗的财务风险。

62
00:03:52.848 --> 00:03:54.642
And this is really the point.
这一点是问题真正所在。

63
00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:58.058
The sad reality is, we develop vaccines
现实的可悲之处在于，

64
00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:01.954
not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people,
我们研制一种疫苗，并非是考虑病原体对人类的风险有多大，

65
00:04:01.978 --> 00:04:06.088
but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines.
而是考虑研制疫苗的经济风险有多大。

66
00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:09.616
Vaccine development is expensive and complicated.
研制疫苗既昂贵又复杂，

67
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.711
It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars
要花费高达数亿美元

68
00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:16.043
to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.
才能选出一种，甚至是已经熟知的抗原，将它转化为可用的疫苗。

69
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:19.275
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,
幸运的是，对于像埃博拉这样的疾病，

70
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.689
there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers.
我们还是可以做一些事情来打破这些壁垒的。

71
00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:26.753
The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure.
首先，要承认市场已经完全不起作用的现状，

72
00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.168
In that case, if we want vaccines,
在这种情况下，如果我们想得到疫苗，

73
00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:35.201
we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy.
就必须提供奖励措施，或某种形式的补贴。

74
00:04:36.017 --> 00:04:40.357
We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out
我们也需要更加努力，

75
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:42.739
which are the diseases that most threaten us.
来找出对我们威胁最大的疾病有哪些。

76
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.995
By creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability
首先确立这些国家内部的研发力量，在此基础上

77
00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:52.636
for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks
我们帮助这些国家建起创立流行病学和实验室网络的能力，

78
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.929
which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens.
有了这些，我们就有能力采集这些病原体，并进行分类。

79
00:04:57.937 --> 00:05:00.199
The data from that then can be used
由此而来的数据

80
00:05:00.223 --> 00:05:03.502
to understand the geographic and genetic diversity,
可用于了解其地理分布和遗传多样性，

81
00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:06.162
which then can be used to help us understand
有助于帮助我们了解

82
00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:09.829
how these are being changed immunologically,
这些免疫学上的变化是如何产生的

83
00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:12.177
and what type of reactions they promote.
以及促进了哪种类型的反应。

84
00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:15.345
So these are the things that can be done,
所以说，这些事情是可以做的，

85
00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:19.053
but to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure,
但要做到这些，如果我们想要在市场无力的情况下解决问题，

86
00:05:19.077 --> 00:05:24.501
we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases.
就必须改变我们看待、预防传染性疾病的方法。

87
00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:28.712
We have to stop waiting until we see evidence
我们不能在看到疾病成为全球性威胁的证据之前， 总是袖手旁观。

88
00:05:28.736 --> 00:05:33.540
of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one.
当我们认为它是的时候，就应该行动起来

89
00:05:34.437 --> 00:05:36.676
So, for Ebola,
所以，对于埃博拉来说，

90
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.591
the paranoid fear of an infectious disease,
对传染性疾病的极度恐慌，

91
00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:45.337
followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries,
出现于几例传染者转移至富裕国家之后。

92
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:47.961
led the global community to come together,
这种恐慌促使全球各国携起手来，

93
00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:51.490
and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies,
加上专门的疫苗公司的努力，

94
00:05:51.514 --> 00:05:53.180
we now have these:
我们才有了现在的结果：

95
00:05:54.285 --> 00:06:00.292
Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries --
两种埃博拉疫苗正在发病国家进行疗效试验，

96
00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:05.821
(Applause)
（掌声）

97
00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:09.829
and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.
后续还会有疫苗不断地生产出来。

98
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.675
Every year, we spend billions of dollars,
每年我们花费数十亿美元，

99
00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.772
keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans
以维持核潜艇舰队，在海洋中持续巡逻，

100
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:22.787
to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen.
而这支舰队所预防的威胁，几乎可以肯定绝不会出现。

101
00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:26.283
And yet, we spend virtually nothing
然而，我们又实际上几乎没有花费多少钱

102
00:06:26.307 --> 00:06:31.334
to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain
来预防流行性传染病这样的问题，

103
00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:33.536
as epidemic infectious diseases.
这个问题切实存在，并且一定是不断进化的。

104
00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:38.724
And make no mistake about it -- it's not a question of "if," but "when."
对此不应当犯错--这不是“如果”的问题，而是“什么时候”的问题。

105
00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:41.660
These bugs are going to continue to evolve
这些病毒还会不断进化，

106
00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:43.687
and they're going to threaten the world.
还会威胁整个世界，

107
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.444
And vaccines are our best defense.
而疫苗是我们的最佳防御手段。

108
00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:51.237
So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola,
所以如果我们想要预防譬如埃博拉的蔓延，

109
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:57.769
we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation.
我们就必须承担风险，向疫苗研制与物资储备投入资金。

110
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.205
And we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent --
而且我们应当，把它看作最终防线--

111
00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.349
something we make sure is available,
我们确保有效的良方，

112
00:07:05.373 --> 00:07:09.012
but at the same time, praying we never have to use it.
而与此同时，祈祷永远不要用到它。

113
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:10.592
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

114
00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:14.894
