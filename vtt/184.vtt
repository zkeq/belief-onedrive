have begun to engage in false advertising,

00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:45.114
diplomas are a brand.
第三，

84
00:04:45.498 --> 00:04:46.887
Many years ago my teacher wrote,
学位是一种品牌。

85
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:49.912
"When students are treated as consumers,
许多年前我的老师写到

86
00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:52.477
they're made prisoners of addiction and envy."
“当学生被当成消费者，

87
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.626
Just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone,
上瘾和嫉妒就会应运而生。

88
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.121
so also people can be sold more and more education.
商家可以不断将最新款的iPhone卖给消费者，

89
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.121
College is the new high school,

90
00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:10.493
we already say that.
大学是新的高中。

91
00:05:10.517 --> 00:05:11.841
But why stop there?
我们早已深知这点。

92
00:05:13.228 --> 00:05:14.627
People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications,
但是我们就此停止吗？

93
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.128
master's degrees, doctoral degrees.
人们想考取证书、认证新的证书

94
00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:20.508
Higher education is also marketed as a status object.
取得硕士、甚至博士学位。

95
00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:26.969
Buy a degree,
高等教育是一种地位象征。

96
00:05:28.454 --> 00:05:29.605
much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag,
购买一个学位，

97
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.816
to distinguish yourself from others.
与买一辆雷克萨斯轿车或一个路易威登包一样，

98
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.634
So you can be the object of envy of others.
都能彰显你的与众不同。

99
00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:37.959
Diplomas are a brand.
这样你就可以成为别人羡慕妒忌的对象。

100
00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:40.220
But these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.
文凭是一种品牌。

101
00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:47.449
There is not a day that goes by
然而这些真相通常都被嘈杂的商业宣传所掩盖。

102
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:51.541
without some policy guy on television telling us,
每一天都有一些讲政策的人

103
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:55.052
"A college degree is absolutely essential
在电视上说：

104
00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:56.134
to get on that up escalator to a middle-class life."
”拥有大学学位是

105
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.388
And the usual evidence offered is the college premium:
过上中产阶级的生活的必需品“

106
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.388
a college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad.
通常此言论的证据是大学溢价：

107
00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:09.659
Let's look at that number more carefully,
大学毕业生的收入平均 比高中毕业生的收入高出56%

108
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.293
because on the face of it,
让我们更仔细地看一下统计数据。

109
00:06:12.317 --> 00:06:17.003
it seems to belie the stories we all hear
因为这和我们平时听到的版本不太一样

110
00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:21.423
about college grads working as baristas and cashiers.
我们通常听到的是大学毕业生 在咖啡店打工或是做收银员

111
00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:27.516
Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education,
每一百名受过中学后教育的人中，

112
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.588
45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,
有45名学生未能及时毕业，

113
00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:33.678
for a number of reasons, including financial.
原因各一，也包括经济因素

114
00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:36.008
Of the 55 that do graduate,
而在55位顺利毕业的人当中，

115
00:06:36.032 --> 00:06:38.080
two will remain unemployed,
2位将找不到工作、

116
00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:40.834
and another 18 are underemployed.
18位的才华得不到充分施展。

117
00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:45.553
So, college grads earn more than high school grads,
大学毕业生的确比高中毕业生挣得更多，

118
00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:48.570
but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition
但这真的能支付高昂的学费、

119
00:06:48.594 --> 00:06:50.985
and the lost wages while at college?
抵消大学时期本可用来工作的收入吗？

120
00:06:51.481 --> 00:06:54.077
Now even economists admit
现在经济学家甚至都承认

121
00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:59.331
going to college pays off for only those who complete it.
只有对能完成学业的来说， 大学才是值得的。

122
00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:03.947
But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone,
但这仅仅是因为几十年来，

123
00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:05.911
for decades now.
高中毕业生的工资少的可怜。

124
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.078
For decades,
几十年来，

125
00:07:09.102 --> 00:07:11.459
workers with a high school degree
拥有高中学历的人们

126
00:07:11.483 --> 00:07:15.586
have been denied a fair share of what they have produced.
无法按劳取酬。

127
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.205
And had they received as they should have,
如果他们得到了自己应有的报酬，

128
00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.182
then going to college would have been a bad investment for many.
那么对许多人来说， 上大学不是个划算的事儿。

129
00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:25.332
College premium?
我想，大学溢价其实是

130
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.515
I think it's a high school discount.
高中折价。

131
00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:32.912
Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job.
三分之二的大学生并不能找到适合的工作。

132
00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:36.687
And the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising --
前景也并不光明，

133
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:38.433
in fact, it's downright bleak.
甚至是彻底的灰暗。

134
00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.861
And it is they who are going to suffer
而正是这些大学生们，

135
00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.044
the most punishing forms of student debt.
他们将承担助学贷款的重担。

136
00:07:45.822 --> 00:07:46.973
And it is they,
正是这些大学生们，

137
00:07:46.997 --> 00:07:48.378
curiously and sadly,
好奇又有些可悲地，

138
00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:52.211
who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing.
大肆宣扬大学溢价。

139
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.203
That's not just cynical marketing,
这样的市场营销不仅是讽刺的，

140
00:07:56.227 --> 00:07:57.377
that's cruel.
更是残酷的。

141
00:07:59.097 --> 00:08:00.247
So what do we do?
那么我们应该怎么做呢？

142
00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:06.708
What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product?
如果学生和家长把高等教育看成消费品怎么样？

143
00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:09.558
Everybody else seems to.
其他人都是这样看待的

144
00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:12.768
Then, like any other consumer product,
然后，就像其他的消费产品一样，

145
00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.291
you would demand to know what you're paying for.
你会想要知道你到底购买了什么产品。

146
00:08:15.315 --> 00:08:16.530
When you buy medicines,
当你购买药物的时候，

147
00:08:16.554 --> 00:08:18.469
you get a list of side effects.
商家会标出一系列的副作用。

148
00:08:18.493 --> 00:08:20.605
