00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.295
A few years ago,
几年前，

2
00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.278
I set out on a mission to find God.
我曾试着寻找上帝，

3
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.469
Now, I'm going to tell you right up front that I failed,
我得先承认，我失败了。

4
00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.079
which, as a lawyer,
身为一名律师，

5
00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:24.260
is a really hard thing for me to admit.
我很难接受这个事实。

6
00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.594
But on that failed journey,
但在这场失败的路途上，

7
00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:30.048
a lot of what I found was enlightening.
我受到了很多启发

8
00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:33.621
And one thing in particular gave me a lot of hope.
尤其是有件事，让我重拾希望。

9
00:00:34.198 --> 00:00:38.124
It has to do with the magnitude and significance of our differences.
这与我们差异的大小和意义有关。

10
00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:43.261
So, I was raised in America by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu,
我在美国长大，父母是印度人， 我接受的是印度文化，

11
00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:47.627
but practicing a strict and relatively unknown religion outside of India
但信仰一种非印度本土，严格、不那么出名的

12
00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:48.807
called Jainism.
叫做耆那教的宗教。

13
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.379
To give you an idea of just how minority that makes me:
告诉你们，我这个宗教是怎么一个少数派：

14
00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:57.328
people from India represent roughly one percent of the US population;
印度裔人大概占美国人口的1%；

15
00:00:57.793 --> 00:00:59.979
Hindus, about 0.7 percent;
印度教教徒，大约有0.7%；

16
00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:06.785
Jains, at most .00046 percent.
耆那教教徒最多只有0.00046%。

17
00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:08.942
To put that in context:
具体而言，

18
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.512
more people visit the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory each year
每年参观泰迪熊佛蒙特工厂的人数

19
00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:15.251
than are followers of the Jain religion in America.
都比美国耆那教教徒还多。

20
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.176
To add to my minority mix, my parents then decided,
我的少数状况又再上一层楼， 因为我的父母决定：

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.894
"What a great idea! Let's send her to Catholic school" --
“真是好主意！那就把她送去天主教学校！”

22
00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:21.936
(Laughter)
（笑声)

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.139
where my sister and I were the only non-white,
在那所学校，只有我和我的妹妹是非白人，

24
00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:26.520
non-Catholic students in the entire school.
非天主教徒的学生。

25
00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:31.431
At the Infant Jesus of Prague School in Flossmoor, Illinois --
在伊利诺斯州弗洛斯穆尔的布拉格少儿耶稣学校

26
00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:33.927
yes, that's really what it was called --
是的，校名就是这样的——

27
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:37.635
we were taught to believe that there is a single Supreme Being
我们被教导要相信只有一位至高无上的神

28
00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.867
who is responsible for everything,
他掌管着世间一切，

29
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.121
the whole shebang,
所有一切。

30
00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:45.301
from the creation of the Universe to moral shepherding to eternal life.
从宇宙的创造到道德引导到永垂不朽。

31
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:46.994
But at home,
但在家中，

32
00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:49.787
I was being taught something entirely different.
父母教给我完全不一样的东西。

33
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.281
Followers of the Jain religion
耆那教教徒

34
00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:54.414
don't believe in a single Supreme Being
并不信奉有这样一位全能神

35
00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:56.218
or even a team of Supreme Beings.
也不相信有一群神灵。

36
00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.606
Instead, we're taught that God manifests
在耆那教，我们被教导

37
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.632
as the perfection of each of us as individuals,
我们每一个人都是上帝的完美化身，

38
00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:04.140
and that we're actually spending our entire lives
而我们这一生所要做的

39
00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:06.043
striving to remove the bad karmas
就是摒弃阻挡前进的恶业

40
00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:10.379
that stand in the way of us becoming our own godlike, perfect selves.
成就自我的神性，完美的自我

41
00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.437
On top of that, one of the core principles of Jainism
最重要的是，耆那教的核心教义是

42
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.107
is something called "non-absolutism."
“非绝对论”。

43
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:20.547
Non-absolutists believe that no single person
非绝对论者认为没有人

44
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.076
can hold ownership or knowledge of absolute truth,
能够掌控所有绝对真理，

45
00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:27.052
even when it comes to religious beliefs.
即便是在宗教信仰上也一样。

46
00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.934
Good luck testing that concept out
愿你可以找到一间天主学校

47
00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.389
on the priests and nuns in your Catholic school.
和那儿的神父和修女验证这个概念。

48
00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:33.729
(Laughter)
（笑声）

49
00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.530
No wonder I was confused
难怪我当时总感到困惑

50
00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:39.110
and hyperaware of how different I was from my peers.
并对我与同龄人的不同非常敏感。

51
00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:41.663
Cut to 20-something years later,
二十多年后，

52
00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:44.570
and I found myself to be a highly spiritual person,
我发现自己是一个高度灵性的人，

53
00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.148
but I was floundering.
但是我有种苦苦挣扎的感觉。

54
00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:47.802
I was spiritually homeless.
我在精神上找不到归宿。

55
00:02:48.453 --> 00:02:51.632
I came to learn that I was a "None,"
我开始意识到我是个“无”，

56
00:02:51.656 --> 00:02:54.794
which isn't an acronym or a clever play on words,
这并非某个缩略词或是诙谐的双关语，

57
00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:56.864
nor is it one of these.
也不是这些之一。 （注：修女nun,英语发音近似）

58
00:02:57.483 --> 00:03:00.197
It's simply the painfully uninspired name
这不过是个痛苦且平淡的词，

59
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.964
given to everyone who checks off the box "none"
当皮尤调查询问他们的宗教信仰时，

60
00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:07.336
when Pew Research asks them about their religious affiliation.
用来让人勾选“无”的选项。

61
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.384
(Laughter)
（笑声）

62
00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:10.877
Now, a couple of interesting things about Nones are:
关于无信仰者，有几个有趣的事情：

63
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:12.083
there are a lot of us,
其实有很多无信仰者，

64
00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:13.593
and we skew young.
年龄偏年轻。

65
00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:21.106
In 2014, there were over 56 million religiously unaffiliated Nones
2014年，在美国有超过5600万人

66
00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.337
in the United States.
属于无宗教信仰者。

67
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.985
And Nones account for over one-third of adults
在18-33岁的成年人口中，

68
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.771
between the ages of 18 to 33.
无宗教信仰者占人口的1/3。

69
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.262
But the most interesting thing to me about Nones
但对我而言，无宗教信仰者最有趣的一点是

70
00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.588
is that we're often spiritual.
我们往往很有灵性。

71
00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:39.832
In fact, 68 percent of us believe, with some degree of certainty,
事实上，68%的人相信， 在一定程度上相信

72
00:03:39.856 --> 00:03:41.236
that there is a God.
神的存在。

73
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.773
We're just not sure who it is.
我们只是不确定它是谁。

74
00:03:42.797 --> 00:03:44.797
(Laughter)
（笑声）

75
00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:47.646
So the first takeaway for me
所以我获得的第一个启发是

76
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.731
when I realized I was a None and had found that information out
当我意识我到作为无神论者，我发现

77
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:53.563
was that I wasn't alone.
我并不孤单。

78
00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.999
I was finally part of a group in America
我终于成为美国群众的一员，

79
00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:57.501
that had a lot of members,
有很多的同伴，

80
00:03:57.525 --> 00:03:59.160
which felt really reassuring.
这感觉真让人安心。

81
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.242
But then the second, not-so-reassuring takeaway
但我学到的第二点， 就不那么令人宽慰了

82
00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.497
was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us.
哦，这么多人无宗教信仰。

83
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:05.743
That can't be good,
这可不太好，

84
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:09.620
because if a lot of highly spiritual people are currently godless,
因为如果很多高灵性的人都是无神论者，

85
00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:13.379
maybe finding God is not going to be as easy as I had originally hoped.
也许寻找神并不像我起初希望的那么简单。

86
00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:16.727
So that is when I decided that on my spiritual journey,
所以那时，我下定决心， 在我的心灵之旅中

87
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.825
I was going to avoid the obvious places
我要避开那些显而易见的地方

88
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.345
and skip the big-box religions altogether
跳过那些广为人知的宗教

89
00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:25.027
and instead venture out into the spiritual fringe
而是冒险进入灵性的边缘

90
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:26.360
of mediums
去探索灵媒，

91
00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:27.566
and faith healers

and godmen.
和神人。

93
00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:32.194
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist,
记住，我是个非绝对论者，

94
00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:36.137
which means I was pretty inclined to keep a fairly open mind,
这意味着我非常乐意保持开放的心态，

95
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.249
which turned out to be a good thing,
结果显示这是件好事，

96
00:04:38.273 --> 00:04:41.987
because I went to a witch's potluck dinner
因为我去纽约市的LGBT多元中心参与了 （注：同性恋、双性恋和跨性别族群）

141

that there was no one who did not have my email address.

但他们给了我完整的地址， 包括房间号和邮编，

right here on this stage,

not because I'm untrustworthy,

276

feels especially important for us all to hear, especially now,

when so many of the world's problems

279
00:13:32.534 --> 00:13:36.521
seem to be because we keep focusing on the things that make us different,

not on what binds us together.

It is, as anyone who works with data would tell you,

hardly a statistically significant or demographically balanced sample.

286

But nonetheless, I find myself thinking about those emails

every time I reflect back on the bias and prejudice

or when there's another hate crime or a senseless tragedy
我们的分歧无法克服

290
