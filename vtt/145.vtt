the trainer in me is awakened as well.

名叫 “我很得体”（G.R.A.C.E.D.）

and when I went to the office of equity to start working,

I remember my computerized training,

nothing, because a computer cannot talk back to you.

So, when I created the "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D" training,
所以， 当我设计“我很得体”培训时，

131
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.494
I created it with that experience that I had in mind,

and what we do.

it challenges their perspective, and it changes their attitudes.
