anything and everything is possible.

The challenge, so often, is hanging on to that as we grow up.
挑战也总是伴随着我们成长。

4
00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:24.001
And as a four-year-old,
我四岁的时候，

5
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.661
I had the opportunity to sail for the first time.
有机会第一次出海航行。

6
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.698
I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast.

7
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.463
I will never forget

the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat
第一次爬上船

9
00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.100
and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time.
并凝视着船舱的感觉。

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.308
But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom,
但最奇妙的是那种自由的感觉，

11
00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:47.046
the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails.
那种挂帆起航的感觉。

12
00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.420
As a four-year-old child,
对于一个四岁的孩子，

13
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.269
it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine.
那是我能想象到的最大的自由感。

14
00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.612
I made my mind up there and then that one day, somehow,
那天，不知何故，我下决心

15
00:00:56.612 --> 00:00:59.670
I was going to sail around the world.
要出海周游世界。

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.180
So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream.
所以我竭尽全力，只为更接近那个梦想。

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.246
Age 10, it was saving my school dinner money change.
10岁的时候，我开始把在学校吃饭省下的零钱攒下来。

18
00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:11.164
Every single day for eight years, I had mashed potato and baked beans,
8年中，我每天只吃土豆泥和烤豆，

19
00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:13.817
which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.
每份只要4便士，而肉汁免费。

20
00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:16.834
Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box,
每天我都把零钱堆在存钱罐顶部，

21
00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:19.424
and when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in
而每攒够一英磅，我就把钱放进存钱罐，

22
00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:23.987
and cross off one of the 100 squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper.
并划掉在纸上预先画好的100个空格中的一个。

23
00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:27.238
Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.
终于，我买到一个小艇。

24
00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:31.201
I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal.
我在花园中花了几个小时，就这么坐在小艇上梦想着我的目标。

25
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:34.320
I read every book I could on sailing,
我读了能找到的每一本关于航行的书，

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.315
and then eventually, having been told by my school
然后学校终于通知我，

27
00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:39.591
I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,
我还不够资格做一名兽医，

28
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:44.274
left school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing.
因此17岁那年我离开了学校，航海学徒的生涯开始了。

29
00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:48.650
So imagine how it felt just four years later

30

to be sitting in a boardroom

31
00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:54.335
in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true.

32
00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:57.823
I felt like my life depended on that moment,

33
00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.464
and incredibly, he said yes.
而且不可思议的是，他同意了。

34
00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.574
And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting
当我第一次坐在会议室，

35
00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:07.384
designing a boat on which I was going to sail
设计我将用于独自连续环球航行的船时，

36
00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:10.263
solo nonstop around the world.
我几乎无法抑制内心的兴奋。

37
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.119
From that first meeting to the finish line of the race,
从第一次会议到比赛的终点线，

38
00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.417
it was everything I'd ever imagined.
这一切我都曾经想象过。

39
00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:19.318
Just like in my dreams, there were amazing parts and tough parts.
正如我想象中的那样，精彩与艰难并存。

40
00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:21.478
We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.
我们曾经只差20英尺就撞到了一个冰山。

41
00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:24.751
Nine times, I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast.
我爬到90英尺的桅杆顶端9次。

42
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.120
We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean.
我们在南大洋逆风行驶。

43
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.092
But the sunsets, the wildlife, and the remoteness
但是落日，野生动物和那种偏远之地的景象

44
00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:33.417
were absolutely breathtaking.
真的美到让人窒息。

45
00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:36.324
After three months at sea, age just 24,
在海上航行了三个月，我那时24岁，

46
00:02:36.324 --> 00:02:38.619
I finished in second position.
以第二名的成绩完成了比赛。

47
00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.570
I'd loved it, so much so that within six months
我太喜欢航行了，甚至在不到6个月后，

48
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.146
I decided to go around the world again, but this time not in a race:
我就决定再次环球航行，但这次不是比赛：

49
00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:52.034
to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world.
是尽量以最快的速度不停站地进行独自环球航行。

50
00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.470
Now for this, I needed a different craft:
为了实现这个目标，我需要换一艘船：

51
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.064
bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.
它更大，更宽，更快，动力更足。

52
00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:02.779
Just to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast
只是把船做得更大一点，这样我就可以爬进她的桅杆

53
00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.683
all the way to the top.
一直到顶部。

54
00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:07.793
Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.
75英尺长，60英尺宽。

55
00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:10.192
I affectionately called her Moby.

56
00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:11.951
She was a multihull.
她是一个多体船。

57
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:18.011
When we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one, though many had tried,
我们造她的时候，还没人能够不停站地独自环球航行，尽管很多人试过了，

58
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:22.883
but whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her
但我们造她的同时，一个法国人用了一艘比它的体积大25%的船，

59
00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:26.672
and not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days
他不仅成功完成了航行，而且把记录从93天

60
00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.168
right down to 72.
降到了72天。

61
00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:31.975
The bar was now much, much higher.
现在，这个时间更是被大大缩短了。

62
00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:33.925
And these boats were exciting to sail.
而且用这些船航行是非常棒的体验。

63
00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:37.292
This was a training sail off the French coast.
这是一个法国海岸附近的训练船。

64
00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:41.007
This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board.
我很了解这艘船，因为我曾是上面的5名船员之一。

65
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:45.358
Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine
只需要5秒钟，我们的世界就会从一切还好

66
00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:48.437
to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater,
变成一片漆黑，因为我们的窗户会进入水下，

67
00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.596
and that five seconds goes quickly.
而那五秒很快。

68
00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.499
Just see how far below those guys the sea is.
只要看看这些家伙比海面高多少就知道了。

69
00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.612
Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean
想象一下独自在南大洋，

70
00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:01.770
plunged into icy water, thousands of miles away from land.

71
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.380
It was Christmas Day.
那是个圣诞节，

72
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.753
I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia.
我在澳大利亚南面的南大洋航行。

73
00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:11.370
The conditions were horrendous.
当时的条件很恶劣。

74
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.351
I was approaching a part in the ocean
我正在接近一块距离

75
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:17.252
which was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town.
最近的城镇也有2000英里的海域。

76
00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:20.131
The nearest land was Antarctica, and the nearest people
最近的陆地是南极洲，而最近的人

77
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:23.000
would be those manning the European Space Station above me.
应该是我上面的那些欧洲空间站的宇航员。

78
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.380
(Laughter)
（笑声）

79
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.189
You really are in the middle of nowhere.
这里真的是前不着村后不着店。

80
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.000
If you need help,
如果你需要帮助，

81
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.556
and you're still alive,
并且还能撑一段时间，

82
00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:33.551
it takes four days for a ship to get to you
一艘船也需要花上四天才能抵达你所在的地方，

83
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.965
and then four days for that ship to get you back to port.
然后再用四天把你带回去。

84
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:39.286
No helicopter can reach you out there,
没有直升机可以到那儿，

85
00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:41.130
and no plane can land.
也没有飞机可以降落。

86
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.404
We are forging ahead of a huge storm.
我们在巨大的风暴中艰难前行。

87
00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.190
Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,
这里的风速达到80海里每小时，

88
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.116
which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with.
这远远超过了一艘船和我个人可以控制的范围。

89
00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:53.157
The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,
浪高达40至50英尺，

90
00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:55.247
and the spray from the breaking crests
破浪的时候产生的水雾

91
00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:58.312
was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard.
像暴风雪一样横扫过来。

92
00:04:58.312 --> 00:05:02.190
If we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm,
如果我们的航行速度不够快，就会被那场风暴吞没，

93
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.347
and either capsized or smashed to pieces.
要么翻船，要么粉身碎骨。

94
00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:11.338
We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge.
毫不夸张地说，我们是把命悬在了刀锋上。

95
00:05:11.338 --> 00:05:15.171
The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger.
我迫切需要的速度带来了危险。

96
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:19.395
We all know what it's like driving a car 20 miles an hour, 30, 40.
我们都知道每小时驾车20英里是什么感觉，或者30，40英里，

97
00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:22.274
It's not too stressful. We can concentrate.
这不会让人觉得太紧张，集中注意力就好。

98
00:05:22.274 --> 00:05:24.062
We can turn on the radio.
我们甚至还能听点广播节目。

99
00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:28.520
Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.
但是当速度从50，60，70，加速到80，90，100英里每小时，

100
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.794
Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel.
现在你会感到极度紧张，需要牢牢地抓住方向盘。

101
00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:34.357
Now take that car off road at night
现在假设你在晚上把车开离公路，

102
00:05:34.357 --> 00:05:36.693
and remove the windscreen wipers, the windscreen,
并且拆掉雨刷和挡风玻璃，

103
00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:38.318
the headlights and the brakes.
还有头灯和刹车。

104
00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:40.524
That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean.
这就是在南大洋（航行）的感觉。

105
00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:44.012
(Laughter) (Applause)
（笑声）（掌声）

106
00:05:44.992 --> 00:05:45.861
You could imagine
你可以想象

107
00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:48.651
it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation,
在那种情况下很难睡着，

108
00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:50.331
even as a passenger.
即便只是作为乘客。

109
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:52.126
But you're not a passenger.
但你不是个乘客。

110
00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:54.525
You're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in,
你独自在船上，连保持站立的姿势都很困难，

111
00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:57.033
and you have to make every single decision on board.
还必须独自在船上做出每一个决定。

112
00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:00.307
I was absolutely exhausted, physically and mentally.
我绝对已经精疲力竭了，不管是身体上还是精神上。

113
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:02.420
Eight sail changes in 12 hours.
12个小时内八个航行变化。

114
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.950
The mainsail weighed three times my body weight,
主帆的重量是我体重的三倍，

115
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.647
and after each change,
每次改变航向后，

116
00:06:06.647 --> 00:06:08.944
I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat
我都会大汗淋漓地瘫坐下来，

117
00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:13.541
with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat.
冰冷的南大洋空气不断侵蚀着我的喉咙。

118
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:16.096
But out there, those lowest of the lows
但在那种情况下，绝境往往能够带来

119
00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:19.416
are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs.
意想不到的惊喜和成功。

120
00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:23.479
A few days later, we came out of the back of the low.
几天后，我们总算度过了最艰难的时期。

121
00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.284
Against all odds, we'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression.
排除万难后，我们在重压之下终于打破了航行的记录。

122
00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:32.070
The sky cleared, the rain stopped,
天空放晴，雨也停了，

123
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.389
and our heartbeat, the monstrous seas around us were transformed
而我们的心跳和滔天巨浪，

124
00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.988
into the most beautiful moonlit mountains.
也转化成了铺满月光的群山，美不胜收。

125
00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:44.585
It's hard to explain, but you enter a different mode when you head out there.
这很难解释，但你到达那里的时候，你就进入了不同的模式。

126
00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:46.570
Your boat is your entire world,
船就是你的整个世界，

127
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.415
and what you take with you when you leave is all you have.
而你离开时携带的东西也是你的全部家当。

128
00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:52.432
If I said to you all now, "Go off into Vancouver
如果我现在对你们说：“去温哥华

129
00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:56.168
and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months,"
找到你在接下来三个月生存所需要的一切东西，”

130
00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:57.936
that's quite a task.
这可是一项艰巨的任务。

131
00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:00.374
That's food, fuel, clothes,
那包括食物，燃料，衣服，

132
00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:02.789
even toilet roll and toothpaste.
甚至卫生纸和牙膏。

133
00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.252
That's what we do,
这就是我们做的，

134
00:07:04.252 --> 00:07:06.156
and when we leave we manage it
当我们离开时，准备计划需要精细到

135
00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:09.820
down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food.
最后一滴油和最后一包食物。

136
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.653
No experience in my life
在我的生命中，

137
00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:15.560
could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word "finite."
没有任何经历可以像这样让我理解到“有限”这个词的意义。

138
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.672
What we have out there is all we have.
我们带到那儿的就是全部家当。

139
00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:19.391
There is no more.
不可能有任何补给。

140
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:22.711
And never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite
而我从没在生命中经历过

141
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:26.031
that I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing
航行时在船上感受到的这种“有限”的概念，

142
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:30.629
until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record.
直到我在终点线下船的时候打破了那个记录。

143
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.775
(Applause)
（掌声）

144
00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:38.755
Suddenly I connected the dots.
突然我找到了一些关联性。

145
00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:40.984
Our global economy is no different.
我们的全球经济其实没有什么不同。

146
00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:46.684
It's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity.
它完全依赖于那些我们在人类历史上只会拥有一次的资源。

147
00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:50.458
And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone
有点像在一块石头下面看到了意想不到的东西，

148
00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:51.967
and having two choices:
你有两种选择：

149
00:07:51.967 --> 00:07:54.521
I either put that stone to one side
要么我把那块石头放一边，

150
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:57.934
and learn more about it, or I put that stone back
并仔细研究它，或者我把它放回去，

151
00:07:57.934 --> 00:08:01.696
and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world.
然后继续我的环球航行梦。

152
00:08:02.346 --> 00:08:03.948
I chose the first.
我选择了第一种。

153
00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:07.431
I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning,
我把它放在一边，并开始了新的学习旅程。

154
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:10.937
speaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists
跟首席执行官，专家，科学家，经济学家探讨，

155
00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:14.559
to try to understand just how our global economy works.
试图了解我们的全球经济是怎么运行的。

156
00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:18.251
And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places.
而好奇心把我带到了一些很棒的地方。

157
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:21.803
This photo was taken in the burner of a coal-fired power station.
这张照片拍摄于一个火力发电站的燃烧炉。

158
00:08:22.383 --> 00:08:25.977
I was fascinated by coal, fundamental to our global energy needs,
我对煤很着迷，它是全球能源需求的最基本来源，

159
00:08:25.987 --> 00:08:28.267
but also very close to my family.
但它也跟我的家庭很有缘。

160
00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:31.064
My great-grandfather was a coal miner,
我的曾祖父是一名煤矿工人，

161
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.420
and he spent 50 years of his life underground.
他在地下矿井工作了50年。

162
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.930
This is a photo of him, and when you see that photo,
这是他的照片当你看到这张照片，

163
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.235
you see someone from another era.
你看到的是另一个时代的人。

164
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:46.123
No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age. (Laughter)
现在这个年代已经没人穿那么高腰的裤子了。（笑声）

165
00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:48.993
But yet, that's me with my great-grandfather,
不过这就是我和我的曾祖父。

166
00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:52.926
and by the way, they are not his real ears. (Laughter)
顺便说一句，他照片里的耳朵是假的。（笑声）

167
00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:57.384
We were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories.
我们很亲近。我还记得坐在他的膝上听他讲挖煤的故事。

168
00:08:57.384 --> 00:08:59.636
He talked of the camaraderie underground,
他讲过矿井下的友情，

169
00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:03.073
and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches
还有矿工们曾经省下三明治的外皮，

170
00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:06.161
to give to the ponies they worked with underground.
喂给跟他们一起工作的小马驹吃。

171
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:08.552
It was like it was yesterday.
感觉就像昨天的事。

172
00:09:08.552 --> 00:09:10.340
And on my journey of learning,
在我学习的旅程中，

173
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.662
I went to the World Coal Association website,
我访问了世界煤炭工业协会的网站，

174
00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:14.984
and there in the middle of the homepage, it said,
在主页的中间位置，有这样一句话：

175
00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:18.142
"We have about 118 years of coal left."
“我们大约还剩118年的煤炭储量。”

176
00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:21.302
And I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime,
我想，还好，那是我死了很久之后的事儿了，

177
00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:24.155
and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil.
而且比预测的石油储量大多了。

178
00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:27.095
But I did the math, and I realized that my great-grandfather
但我算了下，意识到（搜索的）那一年之前

179
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.794
had been born exactly 118 years before that year,
刚好是我曾祖父118岁诞辰，

180
00:09:31.794 --> 00:09:34.557
and I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old,
而我坐在他的膝上直到11岁，

181
00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:36.461
and I realized it's nothing
我意识到这点时间

182
00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:38.783
in time, nor in history.
在历史的长河中不算什么，

183
00:09:38.783 --> 00:09:41.941
And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make:
这促使我做出了我从没想过的一个决定：

184
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.286
to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me
不再独自航行，

185
00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:47.351
and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across:
而专注于我遇到的最大的挑战上：

186
00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:49.681
the future of our global economy.
全球经济的未来。

187
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.390
And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy.
很快我就意识到不仅仅能源是有限的。

188
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.433
It was also materials.
各种材料也是。

189
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.590
In 2008, I picked up a scientific study
2008年，我做了一个科学研究，

190
00:09:56.592 --> 00:09:58.636
looking at how many years we have
看看那些需要通过地下开采获得的

191
00:09:58.636 --> 00:10:01.352
of valuable materials to extract from the ground:
有价值的原料还有多少年的储量。

192
00:10:01.352 --> 00:10:05.741
copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.
铜，61年；锡，锌，40年；银，29年。

193
00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:09.757
These figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite.
这些数字可能并不准确，但我们知道这些资源都是有限的，

194
00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:11.494
We only have them once.
用完即枯竭，不可再生。

195
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:14.987
And yet, our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly,
然而，我们使用这些材料的速度一直在迅速增长，

196
00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:16.294
exponentially.
甚至是指数增长。

197
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.626
With more people in the world with more stuff,
随着世界人口越来越多，产品也更多，

198
00:10:18.768 --> 00:10:21.310
we've effectively seen 100 years of price declines
我们已经看到100年来基本商品价格的

199
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.086
in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years.
下降趋势在短短10年内就被打破了。

200
00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:27.032
And this affects all of us.
这会影响我们所有的人。

201
00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:29.052
It's brought huge volatility in prices,
它带来了价格的巨大波动，

202
00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:31.901
so much so that in 2011,
以至于在2011年，

203
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:34.439
your average European car manufacturer
普通的欧洲汽车制造商都看到

204
00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:39.199
saw a raw material price increase of 500 million Euros,
原材料价格上涨了5亿欧元，

205
00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:41.343
wiping away half their operating profits
吞噬了他们一半的营业利润，

206
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.080
through something they have absolutely no control over.
而面对这一切他们却束手无策。

207
00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:48.191
And the more I learned, the more I started to change my own life.
随着我的了解逐渐深入，我的生活也开始发生了改变。

208
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.669
I started traveling less, doing less, using less.
我开始减少旅行的次数，过更平淡的生活，避免浪费。

209
00:10:50.669 --> 00:10:54.210
It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do.
好像减少浪费是我们不得不做的。

210
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.560
But it sat uneasy with me.
但是这很难做到。

211
00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:57.600
It didn't feel right.
也许并不是个好方法。

212
00:10:57.682 --> 00:11:00.178
It felt like we were buying ourselves time.
好像我们在给自己买时间。

213
00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:02.070
We were eking things out a bit longer.
我们只是勉强把使用时间延长了一点点。

214
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.297
Even if everybody changed, it wouldn't solve the problem.
即使每个人都开始节约，也无法解决根本的问题。

215
00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.341
It wouldn't fix the system.
无法修复整个系统。

216
00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:10.382
It was vital in the transition, but what fascinated me was,
过渡的过程至关重要，但是使我着迷的是

217
00:11:10.382 --> 00:11:14.771
in the transition to what? What could actually work?
要过渡到什么样的状态？到底什么才是行之有效的方法？

218
00:11:14.771 --> 00:11:19.066
It struck me that the system itself, the framework within which we live,
我突然意识到系统本身，我们生活的框架

219
00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:21.365
is fundamentally flawed,
是有根本缺陷的，

220
00:11:21.365 --> 00:11:24.624
and I realized ultimately
最终我意识到，

221
00:11:24.624 --> 00:11:27.657
that our operating system, the way our economy functions,
我们的操作系统，经济运作方式，

222
00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:31.140
the way our economy's been built, is a system in itself.
经济的建设方式，这一切本身就自成系统。

223
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.042
At sea, I had to understand complex systems.
在海上，我必须了解复杂的系统。

224
00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:35.920
I had to take multiple inputs,
我不得不提出多种指令，

225
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.432
I had to process them,
不得不处理它们，

226
00:11:37.432 --> 00:11:40.320
and I had to understand the system to win.
要想赢，我就得去了解这个系统。

227
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.912
I had to make sense of it.
我得搞懂这一切。

228
00:11:41.912 --> 00:11:46.690
And as I looked at our global economy, I realized it too is that system,
当我看着全球经济的时候，我意识到它也是这样的系统，

229
00:11:46.116 --> 00:11:50.528
but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term.
但这个系统不能有效地长期运行。

230
00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:56.159
And I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy for 150 years,
我还意识到我们已经在过去的150年中完善了有效的线性经济，

231
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.144
where we take a material out of the ground,
我们从地下开采原料，

232
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.698
we make something out of it, and then ultimately
做成产品，最后

233
00:12:00.698 --> 00:12:03.972
that product gets thrown away, and yes, we do recycle some of it,
扔掉那个产品，当然，我们也回收一些东西，

234
00:12:03.972 --> 00:12:06.967
but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end,
但更多的是尝试在最后尽点力回收，

235
00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:09.173
not by design.
而不是事先设计好的。

236
00:12:09.173 --> 00:12:12.377
It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term,
这是一个从根本上就不可能长期运行的经济，

237
00:12:12.377 --> 00:12:15.410
and if we know that we have finite materials,
如果我们知道我们只有有限的原料，

238
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:20.597
why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up, that would create waste?
为什么还要建立一个快速消耗，并会造成浪费的 经济系统呢？

239
00:12:20.597 --> 00:12:23.522
Life itself has existed for billions of years
生命本身已经存在了数十亿年，

240
00:12:23.522 --> 00:12:27.144
and has continually adapted to use materials effectively.
并不断适应有效地使用原料。

241
00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:30.465
It's a complex system, but within it, there is no waste.
这是一个复杂的系统，但在这个系统内没有浪费。

242
00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:32.694
Everything is metabolized.
一切都被代谢掉了。

243
00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:36.603
It's not a linear economy at all, but circular.
这完全不是线性经济，它是循环的，

244
00:12:37.754 --> 00:12:40.751
And I felt like the child in the garden.
我就像个孩子在花园中。

245
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:45.418
For the first time on this new journey, I could see exactly where we were headed.
在这个学习的旅程中，我第一次看清了前进的方向。

246
00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:49.202
If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up,
如果我们可以建立一种使用原料而不是耗尽原料的经济，

247
00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:52.430
we could build a future that really could work in the long term.
我们就可以建立一个让一切长期运转的未来。

248
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.334
I was excited.
我很激动。

249
00:12:53.866 --> 00:12:56.334
This was something to work towards.
这是可以努力的方向。

250
00:12:56.493 --> 00:13:00.270
We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there,
一旦知道要做什么，只需要找出实现目标的途径就行了，

251
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.200
and it was exactly with this in mind
于是有了这个想法之后，

252
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.915
that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010.
我们于2010年9月创建了Ellen MacArthur基金。

253
00:13:07.305 --> 00:13:11.168
Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model:
学校的教育塑造了我们的思维并指向了这种模式：

254
00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:15.968
industrial symbiosis, performance economy, sharing economy, biomimicry,
产业共生，性能经济，共享经济，仿生学，

255
00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:18.544
and of course, cradle-to-cradle design.
当然，还有初始到初始的循环设计。

256
00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:22.399
Materials would be defined as either technical or biological,
原料可以是技术性的或生物类的，

257
00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:25.420
waste would be designed out entirely,
垃圾会被完全设计出来。

258
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.114
and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term.
我们将会有一个绝对长期有效的系统。

259
00:13:30.114 --> 00:13:32.181
So what could this economy look like?
那么，这个经济会是什么样子？

260
00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:36.909
Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings, but we'd pay for the service of light,
也许我们不会买灯具但是我们可以付照明费，

261
00:13:36.909 --> 00:13:39.352
and the manufacturers would recover the materials
而厂家将回收这些材料

262
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:42.502
and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products.
并用更高效的产品改变灯具的性能。

263
00:13:42.513 --> 00:13:45.810
What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water
如果包装可溶于水并无毒，

264
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.922
and we could ultimately drink it? It would never become waste.
最后还能被喝掉呢？它就永远不会变成废品。

265
00:13:48.922 --> 00:13:51.035
What if engines were re-manufacturable,
如果引擎可以重新制造呢？

266
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.462
and we could recover the component materials
我们就可以回收组件材料，

267
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.540
and significantly reduce energy demand.
从而显著降低能源需求。

268
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.980
What if we could recover components from circuit boards, reutilize them,
如果我们可以从电路板回收部件，并重新利用，

269
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.060
and then fundamentally recover the materials within them
然后经过第二阶段

270
00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:03.045
through a second stage?
从根本上回收其中的材料呢？

271
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.283
What if we could collect food waste, human waste?
如果我们可以收集食品垃圾，人类排泄物呢？

272
00:14:05.337 --> 00:14:08.518
What if we could turn that into fertilizer, heat, energy,
