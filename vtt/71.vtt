Imagine that when you walked in here this evening,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.340
you discovered that everybody in the room looked almost exactly the same:

generically good-looking.

That person sitting right next to you
那个坐在你右手边的人

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.236
might have the most idiosyncratic inner life,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.516
but you don't have a clue
而你却根本看不出来

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.100
because we're all wearing the same blank expression all the time.
因为我们始终都是同样面无表情

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.140
That is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities,
这就是正在城市中 发生着的诡异转变

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.780
only it applies to buildings, not people.
只不过不是对公众 而是建筑

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.276
Cities are full of roughness and shadow,

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.516
texture and color.
但也有和谐与色彩

13
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.700
You can still find architectural surfaces of great individuality and character

21
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.676
These are just ordinary residences
它们只是一些展现各自城市魅力的

22
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.260
expressing the ordinary splendor of cities.
普普通通的住宅房

23
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.596
And the reason they're like that is that the need for shelter
这些房屋之所以会千奇百丽正是因为

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.700
is so bound up with the human desire for beauty.
人们生存本能中所附带的 对美（生活）的追求

25
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140
Their rough surfaces give us a touchable city.
那些粗糙的表面带给了我们 一个触手可及的城市

26
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.236
Right? Streets that you can read
当你的手指拂过街边的

27
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.380
by running your fingers over brick and stone.
一砖一瓦时 你仿佛走进了 小巷深处的记忆

28
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.100
But that's getting harder to do,
但这样的机会已经越来越少了

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.260
because cities are becoming smooth.
因为城市正在变得光滑

30
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.556

and covered in glass.

marching over the horizon.
正在水平面上前行

39
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.516
Now, just think of everything we lose

when architects stop using the full range of available materials.

篱枝或是石膏

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.076
we simplify architecture
我们简化了这些建筑

45
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.660
and we impoverish cities.
我们抛光了整个城市

46
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.396
It's as if you reduced all of the world's cuisines
这就好比把世界各地的美食

47
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.356
down to airline food.
简化成飞机餐

48
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.436
(Laughter)

49
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.660
Chicken or pasta?
鸡肉和通心粉二选一

50
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.580
But worse still,
但是更槽糕的是

51
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.156
assemblies of glass towers like this one in Moscow
那些像是在莫斯科的 这种玻璃高楼的组合

52
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.076
suggest a disdain for the civic and communal aspects of urban living.
其实暗含着一种对于 城市社会生活的歧视

53
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.156
Right? Buildings like these are intended to enrich their owners and tenants,
像这样的建筑都成为了 招揽开发商或是入驻公司的手段

54
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.756
but not necessarily the lives of the rest of us,
而它们对于每天穿行其中的我们来说

55
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.420
those of us who navigate the spaces between the buildings.
却没有太多存在的意义

56
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.300
And we expect to do so for free.
而我们正在自觉接受这样免费的存在

57
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.060
Shiny towers are an invasive species

58
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.140
and they are choking our cities and killing off public space.
而它们的存在窒息了我们的城市 也碾压了我们的公共空间

59
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.596
We tend to think of a facade as being like makeup,
我们趋向于把建筑的外表 当作被粉饰的门面

60
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.382
a decorative layer applied at the end to a building that's effectively complete.
最后附上的装饰层 会让建筑看起来很完整

61
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.516
But just because a facade is superficial
但是一个轻薄的外表

62
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.796
doesn't mean it's not also deep.
并不意味着建筑本身没有深度

63
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.100
Let me give you an example
我来举个例子看看

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.096
of how a city's surfaces affect the way we live in it.

65
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.956
When I visited Salamanca in Spain,
当我去拜访位于西班牙的 萨拉曼卡的时候

66
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.236
I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor
我被那里的马约尔广场深深吸引

67
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.676
at all hours of the day.
于是一整天都呆在了那儿

68
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.676
Early in the morning, sunlight rakes the facades,
清晨 阳光撒向整个建筑

69
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.396
sharpening shadows,
留下清晰的阴影

70
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.716
and at night, lamplight segments the buildings
到了傍晚时分 灯光将楼房分割成了

71
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.580
into hundreds of distinct areas,
数百个截然不同的小区域

72
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.716
balconies and windows and arcades,
阳台 窗户 还有走廊

73
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.580
each one a separate pocket of visual activity.
都造就了各自独特的视觉区

74
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.140
That detail and depth, that glamour
那些细节 深度和它所带来的魅力

75
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.860
gives the plaza a theatrical quality.
赋予了整个广场以大剧场的视觉效果

76
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.220
It becomes a stage where the generations can meet.
它变成了一个 无论男女老少都可以邂逅的舞台

77
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.356
You have teenagers sprawling on the pavers,
你会看见少年躺在路边

78
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.196
seniors monopolizing the benches,
老年人垄断长椅

79
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.116
and real life starts to look like an opera set.
那真实的生活就像是 戏剧里所布景的那样

80
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.900
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.
这就是关于萨拉曼卡的全貌

81
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.420
So just because I'm talking about the exteriors of buildings,
好了 我们讨论的是一个建筑的外观

82
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.340
not form, not function, not structure,
不是它的组成 功能或是结构

83
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.980
even so those surfaces give texture to our lives,
但仅仅就是这些外观 给我们的生活带来了触动

84
00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.116
because buildings create the spaces around them,
因为建筑创新了周围的空间环境

85
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.156
and those spaces can draw people in
这些空间环境可以吸引人们聚集其间

86
00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:36.490
or push them away.
或是将人们驱逐

87
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.796
And the difference often has to do with the quality of those exteriors.
而这些差距往往就是 由建筑外观的质量决定的

88
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.556
So one contemporary equivalent of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca
说一个与萨拉曼卡的马约尔广场 相较衡的现代广场

89
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.900
is the Place de la Défense in Paris,

90
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.316
a windswept, glass-walled open space

91
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.116
that office workers hurry through

92
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.636
on the way from the metro to their cubicles
从地铁站直奔属于他们的办公室

93
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.020
but otherwise spend as little time in as possible.
除此之外 他们也会尽可能的 少花时间呆在里面

94
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.236
In the early 1980s, the architect Philip Johnson
在上世纪80年代初期 一个叫做Philip Johnson的建筑师

95
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.020
tried to recreate a gracious European plaza in Pittsburgh.

96
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.996
This is PPG Place,

97
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.236
a half acre of open space encircled by commercial buildings
半英亩空地就这样 被由玻璃组成的

98
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.660
made of mirrored glass.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.156
And he ornamented those buildings with metal trim and bays
他运用了金属镶边 间隔排架

100
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.090
and Gothic turrets
还有哥特式的塔楼设计

101
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.860
which really pop on the skyline.
这些使得整栋建筑确实冲破了天际线

102
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.980
But at ground level,
但是从平地的角度来看

103
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.060
the plaza feels like a black glass cage.
整个广场就好像一个黑色的玻璃笼子

104
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.756
I mean, sure, in summertime
我的意思是 是的 在夏日的午后

105
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.236
kids are running back and forth through the fountain
孩子们还是会在喷泉的周围来回跑动

106

and there's ice-skating in the winter,
冬天还是会在这里滑冰

107
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.476
but it lacks the informality of a leisurely hangout.
但是却少了这种娱乐的休闲与自在

108
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
It's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat.
这个广场的确不是那种 会让你想去聚会畅谈的地方

109
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.036
Public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons.
这些公共空间的成功与失败 取决于很多不同的原因

110
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.140
Architecture is only one,
建筑虽然只是其中一方面

111
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.700

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.900
or Superkilen in Copenhagen

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.156
succeed because they combine old and new,

and because they don't rely excessively on glass.

119
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.780
Now, I'm not against glass.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.340
It's an ancient and versatile material.

125
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.340
to translucent bricks.

In expensive cities like New York, it has the magical power

of being able to multiply real estate values by allowing views,

which is really the only commodity that developers have to offer

131
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.460
to justify those surreal prices.

132
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.156
In the middle of the 19th century,

with the construction of the Crystal Palace in London,

135
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.596
By the mid-20th century,
到了20世纪中期

136
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.740
it had come to dominate the downtowns of some American cities,

largely through some really spectacular office buildings

像是在曼哈顿的由Skidmore Owings 和Merrill三人设计的利华大厦

139
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.076
Eventually, the technology advanced to the point

where architects could design structures so transparent

they practically disappear.

142
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.596
And along the way,
在这个过程中

143
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.660
glass became the default material of the high-rise city,
玻璃成为了高楼耸立的 城市中的默认材料

144
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.996
and there's a very powerful reason for that.
其实这些改变的背后 有着强大的理由来支持

145
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.740
Because as the world's populations converge on cities,

the least fortunate pack into jerry-built shantytowns.
