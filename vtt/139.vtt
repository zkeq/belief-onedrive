00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.820
"People do stupid things.
“人会干傻事。

2
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820
That's what spreads HIV."
于是HIV就传播开来。”

3
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,
这句话是一家英国报纸的头条，

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.820
The Guardian, not that long ago.
不久之前出版的《卫报》。

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?
我很好奇，请大家举个手，谁同意这句话？

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820
Well, one or two brave souls.
哦，有一两位勇士。

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist
这句话实际上出自一位流行病学家之口

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,
她研究HIV已有15年，

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.820
worked on four continents,
足迹遍布四大洲，

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.820
and you're looking at her.
你们现在正看着她。

11
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.820
And I am now going to argue
我现在想说明

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.820
that this is only half true.
这句话只说对了一半。

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
People do get HIV because they do stupid things,
有些人确实是因为做了傻事感染了HIV，

14
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
but most of them are doing stupid things
但是其中的大多数人虽然做这些傻事

15
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
for perfectly rational reasons.
却有完全合乎理智的原因。

16
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm
“理智”是公共卫生的

17
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
in public health,
首要准则。

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,
现在你戴上公共卫生怪胎眼镜，

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
you'll see that if we give people the information that they need
你便会知道如果你提供给人们必要的信息

20
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.820
about what's good for them and what's bad for them,
告诉他们什么对他们好，什么不好，

21
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.820
if you give them the services
如果你给他们必要的服务

22
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820
that they can use to act on that information,
使他们能对上述信息做出反应，

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820
and a little bit of motivation,
再加上一丁点的鼓励，

24
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820
people will make rational decisions
人们就会做出理智的决定

25
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820
and live long and healthy lives.
从此健康长寿。

26
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820
Wonderful.
好极了。

27
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.820
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,
但对于像我这样研究HIV的人，有一点小麻烦，

28
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
and although I'm sure you all know
虽然我确信大家都知道

29
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,
HIV与贫穷和两性不平等有紧密的联系。

30
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.820
and if you were at TED '07
如果你参加了TED'07，

31
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820
it's about coffee prices ...
就知道HIV与咖啡的价格紧紧相关；

32
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs,
实际上，HIV和性交，毒品脱不了干系。

33
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.820
and if there are two things that make
如果说世上有两样东西

34
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.820
human beings a little bit irrational,
使人类丧失理智，

35
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.820
they are erections and addiction.
那就是勃起和上瘾。

36
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.820
(Laughter)
（笑声）

37
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.
那么，我们先说说瘾君子认为什么不和逻辑。

38
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
我曾经和一位印尼的朋友，Fankie，聊天。

39
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.820
We were having lunch and he was telling me
我们一起吃午餐，他跟我讲

40
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
他在巴里岛监狱里注射毒品的经历。

41
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.820
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly
那天是一个人的生日，他们偷偷将一些海洛因

42
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.820
smuggled some heroin into jail,
弄进了监狱，

43
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
and he was very generously sharing it out
他非常大方地邀请牢房里的兄弟们

44
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820
with all of his colleagues.
一起享用。

45
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.820
And so everyone lined up,
于是每个人都排好队，

46
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.820
all the smackheads in a row,
所有瘾君子排成一排。

47
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.820
and the guy whose birthday it was
过生日的那个人

48
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.820
filled up the fit,
准备好注射器，

49
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820
and he went down and started injecting people.
蹲下身，开始给兄弟们注射海洛因。

50
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
So he injects the first guy,
他给第一个兄弟注射后，

51
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.820
and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,
顺手用衣服擦擦针管，

52
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.820
and he injects the next guy.
再注射下一个。

53
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.820
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,
Frankie说：“我是第22个，

54
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.820
and I can see the needle coming down towards me,
我看见针管离我越来越近，

55
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
and there is blood all over the place.
地上到处都是血。

56
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
It's getting blunter and blunter.
针管越来越钝。

57
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.820
And a small part of my brain is thinking,
我脑子里在想，

58
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820
'That is so gross
“真是恶心死了

59
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.820
and really dangerous,'
太危险了，”

60
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.820
but most of my brain is thinking,
但是我更关心的是，

61
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820
'Please let there be some smack left
拜托，拜托到我的时候

62
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.820
by the time it gets to me.
针管里还有点海洛因。

63
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820
Please let there be some left.'"
拜托给我留一点。”

64
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.820
And then, telling me this story,
故事讲完后，

65
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820
Frankie said,
Frankie说：

66
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.820
"You know ... God,
“你知道，天，

67
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.820
drugs really make you stupid."
毒品真能让你蠢到极点。”

68
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.820
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.
而且，你知道，他这句话你挑不出一点毛病，

69
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.820
But, actually, Frankie, at that time,
但是Frankie那时，

70
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
was a heroin addict and he was in jail.
是个瘾君子，而且他被关在监狱。

71
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.820
So his choice was either
所以他只能选择

72
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.820
to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
要么接受那血迹斑斑的针头，要么就没法过瘾。

73
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.820
And if there's one place you really want to get high,
如果真有什么地方你确实很想过过瘾，

74
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.820
it's when you're in jail.
那就是监狱。

75
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
But I'm a scientist
但现在我是位科学家，

76
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,
我不会用八卦故事当数据，

77
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.820
so let's look at some data.
所以现在来看看数据。

78
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.820
We talked to 600 drug addicts
我们采访在印尼的三座城市的

79
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820
in three cities in Indonesia,
600名瘾君子，

80
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.820
and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"
我们问他们：“你知道你怎么感染HIV的吗？”

81
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.820
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."
“哦，当然知道。共用一个针头。”

82
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.820
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
我是说，差不多100%，对，都是共用针头害的。

83
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.820
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle
我们又问：“你知道在哪可以买到

84
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.820
at a price you can afford to avoid that?"
干净又便宜的针头吗？”

85
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.820
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
100%的人都答道：“哦，知道。”

86
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.820
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."
“我们吸毒，我们当然知道上哪儿去弄干净的针头。”

87
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.820
"So are you carrying a needle?"
“那你们会带着针头吗？”

88
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.820
We're actually interviewing people on the street,
我们采访的那些地方就在街上，

89
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.820
in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
瘾君子们聚集在一起服毒。

90
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.820
"Are you carrying clean needles?"
“你们带着干净的针头吗？”

91
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.820
One in four, maximum.
最多四分之一的人带着。

92
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.820
So no surprises then that
所以也难怪

93
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.820
the proportion that actually used clean needles
在上周每次注射时真正

94
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.820
every time they injected in the last week
使用干净针头的比例

95
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
is just about one in 10,
只有十分之一。

96
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.820
and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
另外十分之九共用一个针头。

97
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.820
So you've got this massive mismatch;
你看，这前后矛盾。

98
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.820
everyone knows that
每个人都知道

99
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.820
if they share they're going to get HIV,
共用针头会感染HIV，

100
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.820
but they're all sharing anyway.
但是他们还是用一个针头。

101
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.820
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
这是为什么呢？是共用针头让你更过瘾吗？

102
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.820
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"
我们这样问他们，他们说：“你疯了？

103
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.820
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want
你当然不会愿意和别人共用针头，就像你绝不愿意共一把牙刷，

104
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.820
to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
就算他是你的情人也不行。

105
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.820
There's just kind of an ick factor there.
这是因为，你知道，ick的原因。

106
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.820
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
不是，不是。我们共用针头因为我们不想进监狱。”

107
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.820
So, in Indonesia at this time,
现在，在印尼

108
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.820
if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,
如果你被逮到藏有针头，就会被警察抓走，

109
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.820
they could put you into jail.
丢进监狱.

110
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.820
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
这样看的话，情况就不一样了，对吗？

111
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.820
Because your choice now is either
因为这时你的选择就是，

112
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.820
I use my own needle now,
要么用现在自己的针头，

113
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.820
or I could share a needle now
要么现在和别人用一个针头

114
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820
and get a disease that's going to
感染上病

115
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.820
possibly kill me 10 years from now,
过个十年因此而死，

116
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.820
or I could use my own needle now
或者我可以现在用自己的针头

117
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.820
and go to jail tomorrow.
明天就去蹲监狱。

118
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.820
And while junkies think that
虽然瘾君子们认为

119
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.820
it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,
置身于感染HIV的危险中绝不是什么好事，

120
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.820
they think it's a much worse idea
但是在监狱里过一年

121
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.820
to spend the next year in jail
更加糟糕，

122
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.820
where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation
你很可能在监狱里遇上Frankie所说的情况

123
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.820
and expose themselves to HIV anyway.
最终还是可能感染HIV。

124
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.820
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational
这样，突然间，共用针头

125
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.820
to share needles.
就变得非常有道理了。

126
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.
现在我们从政策决策者的角度看看这个问题。

127
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.820
This is a really easy problem.
实际上非常简单。

128
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.820
For once, your incentives are aligned.
终于有一次，大家达成了一致意见。

129
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.820
We've got what's rational for public health.
从公共卫生角度，我们得出了理性的答案。

130
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.820
You want people to use clean needles --
我们希望瘾君子用干净的针头，

131
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.820
and junkies want to use clean needles.
瘾君子也想用干净的针头。

132
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.820
So we could make this problem go away
所以我们只用使瘾君子们能随时拿到针头

133
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.820
simply by making clean needles universally available
同时让他们不必担心被逮捕

134
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.820
and taking away the fear of arrest.
就能解决这个问题。

135
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.820
Now, the first person to figure that out
而第一个想出这一招

136
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820
and do something about it on a national scale
并在全国执行的人

137
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.820
was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal
就是大名鼎鼎的“铁娘子”

138
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.820
Margaret Thatcher.
英国首相撒切尔夫人。

139
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.820
And she put in the world's first
她推行了全球第一项

140
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.820
national needle exchange program,
国家针头交换计划

141
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.820
and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
其他国家竞相效仿，澳大利亚，荷兰和一小部分其他国家，

142
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.820
And in all of those countries, you can see,
在这些国家里，你们可以看到，

143
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.820
not more than four percent of injectors
低于百分之四的吸毒人员

144
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.820
ever became infected with HIV.
曾因注射而感染HIV。

145
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.820
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example,
再看，没有实行这一政策的国家，比如纽约，

146
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.820
Moscow, Jakarta --
莫斯科，雅加达，

147
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.820
we're talking, at its peak,

148
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.820
one in two injectors

149
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.820
infected with this fatal disease.
就有一个感染了这种致命疾病。

150
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.820
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this
撒切尔首相做这些

151
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.820
because she has any great love for junkies.
不是因为她对瘾君子有恻隐之心，

152
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.820
She did it because she ran a country
她这样做是她执政的国家

153
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
that had a national health service.
有国家免费医疗系统。

154
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.820
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,
所以，如果她不在有效疾病预防方面投资，

155
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.820
she was going to have pick up the costs
她以后就必须为疾病的治疗

156
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820
of treatment later on,
付出昂贵的费用，

157
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.820
and obviously those are much higher.
而且治疗的费用昂贵的多。

158
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.820
So she was making a politically rational decision.
所以她做出了一个政治上很理智的决定。

159
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.820
Now, if I take out my

160
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.820
public health nerd glasses here

161
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.820
and look at these data,
再看看这些数据，

162
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.820
it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
这完全不合逻辑。

163
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.820
But in this country,
但是在这个国家，

164
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
where the government apparently does not feel compelled
政府显然不认为他们必须

165
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820
to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)
为公民提供免费医疗，

166
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.820
we've taken a very different approach.
我们于是采取了大相径庭的解决方法。

167
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.820
So what we've been doing in the United States
在美国，我们一直在做的事情是

168
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.820
is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.
验证数据，不断地验证。

169
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.820
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies
于是上百个研究的数据

170
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.820
by all the big muckety-mucks
被大型的muckety-mucks

171
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.820
of the scientific pantheon in the United States,
美国科学界圣人验证，

172
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.820
and these are the studies that show
而大量的研究表明

173
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.820
needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.
针头计划是有效的。

174
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.820
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --
再看，这些表明针头计划无效的研究

175
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.820
you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides
你们认为在这张烦人的幻灯片上，

176
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.820
and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,
我按一下手中的遥控器，剩下的数据就会出现，

177
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.820
but no -- that's the whole slide.
但是，没有，这张幻灯片上就这么多内容。

178
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.820
(Laughter)
（笑声）

179
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.820
There is nothing on the other side.
另外一栏什么也没有。

180
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.820
So, completely irrational,
那么，这完完全全没有道理。

181
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.820
you would think.
你肯定这样想，

182
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.820
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,
只是，等下，不对，政客们也是理智的，

183
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.820
and they're responding to what they think the voters want.
而且他们所做的事情是他们认为选民们想做的。

184
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.820
So what we see is that voters respond
我们看到的是选民们都

185
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.820
very well to things like this
十分愿意回应这种情况

186
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.820
and not quite so well to things like this.
而不愿意回应这种情况。

187
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:47.820
(Laughter)
（笑声）

188
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.820
So it becomes quite rational
所以拒绝向瘾君子提供服务

189
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.820
to deny services to injectors.
就显得很有道理。

190
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.820
Now let's talk about sex.
现在来说说性交。

191
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.820
Are we any more rational about sex?
我们在性交上更理智吗？

192
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.820
Well, I'm not even going to address
呃，我根本不会去评论

193
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.820
the clearly irrational positions
天主教徒们那些

194
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.820
of people like the Catholic Church,
完全不和逻辑的想法。

195
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.820
who think somehow that if you give out condoms,
以为只要你免费发保险套，

196
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.820
everyone's going to run out and have sex.
人们就会出去找乐子。

197
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.820
I don't know if Pope Benedict
我不知道本尼迪克特教皇

198
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.820
watches TEDTalks online,
是否会在线看TED的演讲，

199
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.820
but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --
但是教皇，您看的话，我有话要跟您讲。

200
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.820
I carry condoms all the time
我随身带着保险套，

201
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.820
and I never get laid.

202
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.820
(Laughter) (Applause)
（笑声）

203
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.820
It's not that easy!
这种机会可不容易找。

204
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.820
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.
接着，也许你的运气好一点。

205
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.820
(Applause)
（掌声）

206
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.820
Okay, seriously,
OK，严格地说，

207
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.820
HIV is actually not that easy
HIV不是很容易

208
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.820
to transmit sexually.
通过性交传染。

209
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.820
So, it depends on how much virus there is
是否传染取决于你血液和体液所含的

210
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.820
in your blood and in your body fluids.
病毒数量

211
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.820
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus
当某人感染HIV后，在感染最初期

212
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.820
right at the beginning when you're first infected,
病毒含量非常，非常高，

213
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.820
then you start making antibodies,
然后你的身体开始产生抗体，

214
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.820
and then it bumps along at quite low levels
之后很长的一段时间内

215
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.820
for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --
10年或12年，病毒的含量都保持在相当低的水平，

216
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.820
you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
如果你有与他人发生关系而受到感染，you have spikes ，

217
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.820
But basically, nothing much is going on
但一般而言，在你开始出现艾滋病的

218
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.820
until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,
症状之前，不会发生什么。

219
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.820
and by that stage,
而到了那一阶段，这里，

220
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.820
you're not looking great, you're not feeling great,
你会看起来很糟，感觉很不好，

221
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.820
you're not having that much sex.
不会发生很多性交。

222
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.820
So the sexual transmission of HIV
所以通过性交感染HIV基本取决于

223
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.820
is essentially determined by how many partners you have
当你体内的病毒达到高潮时

224
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.820
in these very short spaces of time
的那一段非常短的时间段内

225
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.820
when you have peak viremia.
你有多少位同伴。

226
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.820
Now, this makes people crazy
这一来人们就要发疯了

227
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.820
because it means that you have to talk about
因为这意味着你必须谈论

228
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.820
some groups having more sexual partners
有些人在较短的时间内

229
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.820
in shorter spaces of time than other groups,
比另外一些人有更多的同伴，

230
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.820
and that's considered stigmatizing.
这样就太侮辱人了。

231
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.820
I've always been a bit curious about that
我一直都对此很好奇

232
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.820
because I think stigma is a bad thing,
因为我认为侮辱是件很不好的事情，

233
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.820
whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,
而然性交频繁却是件很好的事，

234
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.820
but we'll leave that be.
不过这事就这样吧。

235
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.820
The truth is that 20 years
事实是20年来

236
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.820
of very good research
很出色的研究

237
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.820
have shown us that
告诉我们

238
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.820
there are groups that are more likely to turnover
有一些人更倾向于

239
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.820
large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
在短时期内有很多伙伴，

240
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.820
And those groups are, globally,
而基本上这些人，

241
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.820
people who sell sex and their more regular partners.
都是出卖色情，有更多的同伴，

242
00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.820
They are gay men on the party scene
在派对上的同性恋拥有的伙伴数量

243
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.820
who have, on average, three times more partners

244
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.820
than straight people on the party scene.
多出两倍，

245
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.820
And they are heterosexuals
还有些异性恋

246
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.820

and relatively high levels of female autonomy,

249
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.820
and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
大多数此类国家都在南部非洲的东部。

250
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.820
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
这些都反映在现在大范围流行的疾病上。

251
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.820
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
大家看来自非洲的这些数据，让人不寒而栗。

252
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.820
These are all countries in southern Africa

253
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.820
where between one in seven,
七分之一

254
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.820
and one in three
到三分之一

255
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.820
of all adults,
的成年人

256
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.820
are infected with HIV.
都感染了HIV。

257
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.820
Now, in the rest of the world,
而在世界其他国家，

258
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.820
we've got basically nothing going on in the general population --
基本上普通大众平安无事，

259
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.820
very, very low levels --
非常低的比率，

260
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.820
but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV
但是HIV携带率

261
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.820
in these other populations who are at highest risk:
在高危人群中的比率异常的高，

262
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.820
drug injectors, sex workers
像注射毒品的瘾君子，性工作者，

263
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.820
and gay men.
男同性恋。

264
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:
大家注意看旧金山的地方数据。

265
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.820
25 percent prevalence among gay men.
有25%的同性恋感染了HIV。

266
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.820
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
当然，如果只进行无预防措施的性交不会染上HIV。

267
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.820
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex
你只有和在传染期的携带者

268
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.820
with a positive person.
发生无预防措施的性交才会染病。

269
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.820
In most of the world,
在世界大多数地方，

270
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.820
these few prevention failures
有些预防措施失效了

271
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.820
notwithstanding,
但不多，

272
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.820
we are actually doing quite well these days
在性交易行业里

273
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.820
in commercial sex:
实际上，我们（预防措施）做的很不错。

274
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.820
condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent
在大多数国家性性交易行业

275
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.820
in commercial sex in most countries.
安全套的使用率在80%到100%。

276
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.820
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
正是因为形成了这些鼓励措施

277
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.820
What's rational for public health
对公共卫生讲这是理智的行为

278
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.820
is also rational for individual sex workers
对个体性工作者也是理智的。

279
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.820
because it's really bad for business to have another STI.
因为染上病会影响生意。

280
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.820
No one wants it.
没人希望如此。

281
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.820
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
而且，也没有哪个顾客想带病回家。

282
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.820
So essentially, you're able to achieve
所以最终，你可以在性交易行业

283
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.820
quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
达到高安全套使用率。

284
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.820
But in "intimate" relations
但是在“亲密”关系中，

285
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.820
it's much more difficult because,
就困难的多了

286
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.820
with your wife or your boyfriend
因为也许你的妻子或男友，

287
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.820
or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,
或你想进一步发展成为恋人或配偶的那个人，

288
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.820
we have this illusion of romance
因为某种浪漫的幻想

289
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.820
and trust and intimacy,
信任和亲密，

290
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.820
and nothing is quite so unromantic
没有什么比“亲爱的，用你的安全套还是我的”

291
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.820
as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
这样的问题，更让人扫兴的了。

292
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.820
So in the face of that,
所以，在那种情况下，

293
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.820
you really need quite a strong incentive
你需要有强大的意愿

294
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.820
to use condoms.
才会使用安全套。

295
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.820
This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.
就像这位先生，他叫Joseph。

296
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.820
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
来自海地，患有艾滋，

297
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.820
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,
现在他大概没有什么性交，

298
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.820
but he is a reminder in the population,
但是他提醒着其他的人们，

299
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.820
of why you might want to be
你为什么想用

300
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.820
using condoms.
安全套。

301
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.820
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder
这张也在海地，提醒着你

302
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.820
of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
为什么想上床。

303
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.820
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph
好了，挺好笑，这张还是Joseph。

304
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.820
after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
在进行抗病毒治疗6个月后（的照片）。

305
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.820
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
这就是为什么我们称之为拉撒路效应。

306
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.820
But it is changing the equation
但是这样一来等式两边就不平衡了

307
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.820
of what's rational
在性交时

308
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.820
in sexual decision-making.
什么样的决定才是理智的。

309
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.820
So, what we've got --
我们听到

310
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.820
some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much
有些人说：“这没什么要紧的

311
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.820
because, actually, treatment is effective prevention
因为实际上，治疗非常有效

312
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.820
because it lowers your viral load and therefore
治疗使你体内的病毒减少了

313
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.820
makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
所以就很难传递HIV了。”

314
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.820
So, if you look at the viremia thing again,
那么，如果大家再看看感染病毒的情况，

315
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820
if you do start treatment when you're sick,
如果你在生病时就开始治疗，

316
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.820
well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
你体内的病毒携带量就会下降。

317
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.820
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?
但是这跟怎么比呢？如果你没有接受治疗呢？

318
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.820
Well, you die,
那你就会死，

319
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.820
so your viral load goes to zero.
这样你体内的病毒携带量变成了零。

320
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.820
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --
这些绿色部分，包括SPIKES，

321
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.820
which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,
是因为你没有去看医生

322
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.820
or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge
或者你没有药了，或者你去派对狂欢三天

323
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.820
and forgot to take your drugs,
完全忘记吃药，

324
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.820
or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --
或者你的身体开始产生抗药性，或者随便别的什么，

325
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.820
all of that is virus
这些全部是病毒

326
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.820
that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
不是因为治疗，这些都不会在这里。

327
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.820
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
那我的意思是，好啊，多棒的预防策略啊，

328
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820
Let's just stop treating people."
我们都别给患者治病了吧？

329
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.820
Of course not, of course not.
当然不是，当然不是，

330
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.820
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
我们必须尽量让更多的人接受抗病毒的治疗。

331
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820
But what I am doing is calling into question
但是我要提出一个问题

332
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.820
those people who say that more treatment
问那些说只要更多的治疗就足够我们预防艾滋的人

333
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.820
is all the prevention we need.
你们凭什么这么说。

334
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.820
That's simply not necessarily true,
事实显然并非如此，

335
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.820
and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men
在发达国家艾滋病的治疗已经普及了15年，

336
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.820
in rich countries where treatment has been widely available
我们可以在那些国家的男同性恋那里

337
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.820
for going on 15 years now.
学到很多教训，

338
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.820
And what we've seen is
我们看到

339
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820
that, actually, condom use rates,
实际上，安全套的使用率

340
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820
which were very, very high --
非常，非常高

341
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.820
the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,
同性恋群中，对HIV的反应也很迅速，

342
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.820
with extremely little help
几乎不需要

343
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.820
from public health nerds, I would say --
公共卫生人员的帮助

344
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.820
that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment
接受治疗后，安全套的使用率开始锐减

345
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820
for two reasons really:
主要有两个原因。

346
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820
One is the assumption of, "Oh well,
有一种想法是：“呃，

347
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.820
if he's infected, he's probably on meds,
要是他感染了，他肯定在吃药，

348
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.820
and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
那他的病毒携带量就很低，所以我安全的很。”

349
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.820
And the other thing is that people are simply
另一个原因是人们根本

350
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.820
not as scared of HIV
不像害怕艾滋一样

351
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820
as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
害怕HIV，这样想也对。

352
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.820
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,
艾滋把你折腾的不像人样，还致你于死命，

353
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820
and HIV is an invisible virus
HIV是看不见摸不着的病毒

354
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820
that makes you take a pill every day.
害你每天吃片药。

355
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.820
And that's boring,
真无聊，

356
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.820
but is it as boring as
就和每次做爱都要用安全套

357
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.820
having to use a condom every time you have sex,
一样的无聊，

358
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.820
no matter how drunk you are,
不管你喝的多醉，

359
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.820
no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
不管你和几个瘾君子上床，什么都不管

360
00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820
If we look at the data, we can see that
看看数据，我们会发现

361
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.820
the answer to that question
问题的答案就在

362
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.820
is, mmm.
嗯——

363
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.820
So these are data from Scotland.
这些是苏格兰的数据

364
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.820
You see the peak in drug injectors
你看毒品注射者这些峰值

365
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.820
before they started the national needle exchange program.

366
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.820
Then it came way down.
之后人数下降了

367
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.820
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --
不管是异性恋，大多数是性工作者

368
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820
and in drug users,
还是瘾君子，

369
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.820
you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,
在开始治疗之后，基本上没有出现任何状况，

370
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820
and that's because of that alignment of incentives
这要归功于我先前提到的

371
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.820
that I talked about earlier.
那些鼓励政策

372
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.820
But in gay men,
但是男同性恋中，

373
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.820
you've got quite a dramatic rise
在治疗广泛推行的

374
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.820
starting three or four years

375
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.820
after treatment became widely available.
数量却急剧上升。

376
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.820
This is of new infections.
这些是新增的感染者。

377
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.820
What does that mean?
这意味着什么？

378
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.820
It means that the combined effect of being less worried
这意味着一方面人们不再那么害怕（HIV）

379
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.820
and having more virus out there in the population --

380
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.820
more people living longer, healthier lives,
更多人活的更长，更健康，

381
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.820
more likely to be getting laid

382
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.820
with HIV --
这些综合因素的影响

383
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.820
is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,
已超过了低病毒携带的影响，

384
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.820
and that's a very worrisome thing.
这让我很担心。

385
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.820
What does it mean?
这意味着什么？

386
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.820
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
这意味着医疗方法越进步，我们越要加强预防力度。

387
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.820
Is that what's happening?
实际情况时这样的吗？

388
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.820
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."
不，我把这种情况称作同情难题。

389
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.820
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,

390
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.820
and what's happening really is that people are

391
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.820
unable quite to bring themselves to put in

good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,

393
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.820
unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
很难给瘾君子发针头，

394
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.820
But once they've gone from being
但是一旦他们不再是不可饶恕的

395
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.820
transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone
瘾君子或性工作者，

396
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.820
to being AIDS victims,
而成为了艾滋病人，

397
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.820
we come over all compassionate

398
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.820
and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
为他们买昂贵的药物，直到他们生命终结的那天。

399
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.820
It doesn't make any sense
从公共卫生的角度讲

400
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.820
from a public health point of view.
这完全没有道理。

401
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.820
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.
我想对Ines说几句离别的话。

402
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.820
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;

she's a chick with a dick.
她是有小鸡鸡的女生。

404
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.820
Why does she do that job?
她为什么当妓女？

405
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.820
Well, of course, because she's forced into it
当然是因为她被逼无奈

406
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.820
because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
别无选择，等等等等，

407
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.820
And if we could just teach her to sew
但是如果我们教她缝纫

408
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.820
and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.

409
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.820
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:
在印尼，工厂工人平均一个小时

410
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.820
on average, 20 cents.

411
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.820
It varies a bit province to province.
每个省份的情况稍微有点不同。

412
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.820
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them
这张幻灯片上的数据

413
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.820
for this particular slide,
来自我在和15000名性工作者的谈话。

414
00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.820
and this is what sex workers
这是性工作者自报的

415
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.820
say they earn in an hour.
每小时的薪水。

416
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.820
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people
这个工作不怎么样，但是对很对人而言

417
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.820
it really is quite a rational choice.
确实很明智的选择。

418
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.820
Okay, Ines.
OK，Ines。

419

We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,

421
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.820
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?
Ines：那为什么HIV的携带者数量还在上升？

422
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.820
It's all politics.
都是因为政治原因。

423
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.820
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
当政治介入后，一切都变得毫无道理。

424
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.820
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."
Elizabeth Pisani：“当政治介入后，一切都变得毫无道理。”

425
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.820
So, from the point of view of a sex worker,
从性工作者的角度看，

426
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.820
politicians are making no sense.
政客们完全没有道理。

427
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.820
From the point of view of a public health nerd,
从公共卫生怪胎的角度看，

428
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.820
junkies are doing dumb things.
瘾君子们在做蠢事。

429
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.820
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
每个人都有自己的一套逻辑。

430
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.820
There are as many different ways of being rational
世上有多少个人

431
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.820
as there are human beings on the planet,
就有多少种逻辑。

432
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.820
and that's one of the glories of human existence.
这是人类的闪光点之一。

433
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.820
But those ways of being rational
但是种种不同的逻辑

434
00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.820
are not independent of one another,
并不是单存于世。

435
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.820
so it's rational for
所以瘾君子们

436
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.820
a drug injector to share needles
共用针头很理性

437
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.820
because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,
因为政治家的一个愚蠢的决定，

438
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.820
and it's rational for a politician
政治家做了愚蠢的决定

439
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.820
to make that stupid decision
也很理智

440
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.820
because they're responding to
