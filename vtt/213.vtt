00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:37.870
You see, Daniel is a really social guy,
Daniel是个很爱社交的人，

30
00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:39.653
and he's blind and quadriplegic,
也是个四肢瘫痪的盲人，

31
00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:44.293
which makes it hard to use those devices that we all take for granted.
我们认为理所当然的设备， 对他来说却很难用。

32
00:01:44.317 --> 00:01:46.759
The last time I was at his house, his brother said,

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:07.400
The irony here is great.
不过也相当讽刺。

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:22.903
is diagnosing cancer.
也就是癌症诊断。

46
00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:26.770
When a doctor suspects cancer,

47
00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:29.497
they take a sample and send it to a pathologist,

who looks at it under a microscope.
病理学家再利用显微镜来看样本。

49

52
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:42.303
some researchers made an AI classifier.
有几位研究人员做出了一种 人工智能分类器。

Now, the classifier says, "Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"
现在，分类器已经会看着图片分辨：

54
00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:49.250
looking at the pictures.
“这是不是癌症？”

55
00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:51.739
The classifier was pretty good,
分类器挺厉害的，

56
00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:54.472
but not as good as the person,

who got it right most of the time.
人类大部分都能判读正确。

59
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.446
accuracy went to 99.5 percent.

61
00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:17.681
that the human pathologist would have made working alone.

62
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.799
That's a lot of cancer that would have otherwise gone untreated.
这其中很多的癌症患者， 当初就是因误判而耽搁了治疗。

63
00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:24.847
Now, for the curious, it turns out
人类因为好奇的原因，

64
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.345
that the human was better at rejecting false positives,
比较擅长判断假阳性案例，

65
00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.941
and the machine was better at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.
而机器则比较擅长判断 难以辨别的案例。

66
00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:35.202
But the lesson here isn't about which agent is better
但我们学到的并不是

67
00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:37.296
at this image-classification task.
谁在图像分类上比较厉害。

68
00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:39.547
Those things are changing every day.

69
00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:41.139
The lesson here
这里我们学到的是，

70
00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:44.523
is that by combining the abilities of the human and machine,
通过结合人类与机器的能力，

71
00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:49.498
it created a partnership that had superhuman performance.

79
00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.864
and you enter the form and the materials, and then you analyze performance.
输入了外形和材料， 然后按下分析表现。

80
00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:13.232
That gives you one design.
它只会跑出一种设计方案。

81
00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:17.659
If you give those same tools to an AI,
如果你把这些工具拿给 AI 使用，

82
00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:20.807
it can generate thousands of designs.
它会帮你跑出数千种设计。

83
00:04:22.013 --> 00:04:23.947

这就改变了我们设计的方式。

86
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:30.435
The human engineer now
现在，人类工程师

87
00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.774
says what the design should achieve,
只要说出想要实现的设计，

88
00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:34.954
and the machine says,
机器就会说：

89
00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:36.348
"Here's the possibilities."

90
00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:40.518
Now in her job, the engineer's job
现在，她作为工程师的工作，

91
00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:43.642
is to pick the one that best meets the goals of the design,
就是选出一种最符合目标的设计，

92
00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:47.005
which she knows as a human better than anyone else,

94
00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:50.814
In this case, the winning form

97
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.093
and all that unnecessary fur.
也不需有那些皮毛。

98
00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:04.916
Now let's see where this idea of humanistic AI might lead us
我们现在来想想， 如果我们跟着人性化 AI 走，

99
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.333
if we follow it into the speculative beyond.

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.255
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?
认知强化如何？

102
00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.203
Instead of asking,
别再问：

103
00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:19.288
"How smart can we make our machines?"
“我们能把机器做到多聪明？”

104
00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:20.485
let's ask
而是要改问：

105
00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.214
"How smart can our machines make us?"
“我们的机器能把我们变得多聪明？”

106
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.705
I mean, take memory for example.
举个例子，记忆。

107
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:30.277
Memory is the foundation of human intelligence.
记忆是人类智能的基础。

108
00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:34.558
But human memory is famously flawed.

109
00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:37.435
We're great at telling stories,
我们很会说故事，

110
00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:39.410
but not getting the details right.
但无法保证细节都是准确的。

111
00:05:39.434 --> 00:05:42.640
And our memories -- they decay over time.
我们的记忆——会随时间衰退。

112
00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:45.896
I mean, like, where did the '60s go, and can I go there, too?
比如，六十年代去哪了？ 我也能去那儿吗？

113
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.387
(Laughter)
（笑声）

114
00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:52.772

115
00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.837
and was about your life?
