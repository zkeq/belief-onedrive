1
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.828
Well, we all need a reason to wake up.
我们都需要一个醒来的理由。

2
00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.091
For me, it just took 11,000 volts.
对我来说是11,000伏特。

3
00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.562
I know you're too polite to ask,
我知道你们太礼貌了不会过问，

4
00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:26.221
so I will tell you.
那就让我告诉你们。

5
00:00:27.174 --> 00:00:29.397
One night, sophomore year of college,
在大学二年级，

6
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:33.119
just back from Thanksgiving holiday,
感恩节假期后的一天晚上，

7
00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:35.795
a few of my friends and I were horsing around,
我和几个朋友闹着玩儿，

8
00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:39.384
and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train.
决定爬到一列停在一旁的通勤列车顶上。

9
00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:43.101
It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead.
它就停在那儿，缆线就在车顶上方。

10
00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.227
Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time.
不知为什么， 这似乎在那个时候是一个好主意。

11
00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:49.106
We'd certainly done stupider things.
我们的确干过比这个还傻的事。

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.111
I scurried up the ladder on the back,
我从后面的梯子窜了上去，

13
00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:54.857
and when I stood up,
当我站起来的时候，

14
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.463
the electrical current entered my arm,
一股电流进入了我的手臂，

15
00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:01.027
blew down and out my feet, and that was that.
一直到我的脚下然后就这样了。

16
00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.108
Would you believe that watch still works?
你能相信那块手表还没坏吗？

17
00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:09.243
Takes a licking!
真是金刚不坏！

18
00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:10.298
(Laughter)
（笑声）

19
00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:12.631
My father wears it now in solidarity.
我的父亲现在还一直戴着那块手表。

20
00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:21.138
That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death --
那天晚上开启了我和死亡 正式的关系——我的死亡——

21
00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:24.970
and it also began my long run as a patient.
也开始了我作为病人的漫长的旅程。

22
00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:26.148
It's a good word.
这是一个很合适的词。

23
00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:27.899
It means one who suffers.
它的意思是一个受苦的人。

24
00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:30.086
So I guess we're all patients.
我想我们应该都是病人吧。

25
00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:33.793
Now, the American health care system
美国的医疗保健系统

26
00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:36.938
has more than its fair share of dysfunction --
有不少的功能障碍——

27
00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:39.022
to match its brilliance, to be sure.
当然，它也有杰出的方面。

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.022
I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc,
我现在是一名医生， 安宁病房和临终关怀医生，

29
00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:46.292
so I've seen care from both sides.
所以我从两个角度看医疗系统。

30
00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:50.795
And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare
相信我：几乎每一个从事医疗的人

31
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.956
really means well -- I mean, truly.
都是十分好心的——是真的。

32
00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:58.627
But we who work in it are also unwitting agents
但是我们这些从事医疗的人也是

33
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.895
for a system that too often does not serve.
在一个有许多缺陷的系统中工作。

34
00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:04.976
Why?
为什么呢？

35
00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:08.825
Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question,
其实有一个很简单的答案，

36
00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.097
and it explains a lot:
而且也能反映很多事情：

37
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:17.079
because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center.
因为医疗系统的设计是针对疾病的， 而病人不是焦点，

38
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.145
Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed.
也就是说这个设计是有问题的。

39
00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:28.030
And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking
而在生命的尽头，不良的设计的影响

40
00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:31.389
or the opportunity for good design more compelling
更加让人心痛，完善的设计的机会

41
00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:33.554
than at the end of life,
也显得更有必要，

42
00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:36.934
where things are so distilled and concentrated.
因为在生命的尽头， 所有的东西都是浓缩下来的精华。

43
00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:39.840
There are no do-overs.
没有重新来过的机会。

44
00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:46.384
My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines
我今天的目的就是号召各个领域的人们，

45
00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:50.775
and invite design thinking into this big conversation.
邀请大家把设计思维带入这个大话题中。

46
00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:56.672
That is, to bring intention and creativity
也就是将好意和创意

47
00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:59.465
to the experience of dying.
带入濒死的经历。

48
00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:05.088
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us,
这是一个十分难得的机会，

49
00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:09.453
before one of the few universal issues
这是一个会影响到个人， 以及整个社会的

50
00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:12.787
as individuals as well as a civil society:
普遍问题之一：

51
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:16.727
to rethink and redesign how it is we die.
重新思考并设计我们如何面对死亡。

52
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.899
So let's begin at the end.
我们从终点开始谈起。

53
00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:27.366
For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead,
对大多数人来说， 变成死人并不是死亡最可怕的部分，

54
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.209
it's dying, suffering.
最可怕的是垂死，病痛。

55
00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.004
It's a key distinction.
这是一个关键的区别。

56
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:34.449
To get underneath this, it can be very helpful
为了更好地领会这一切， 那就非常有必要

57
00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:38.827
to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is,
区分一下死亡无法避免的痛苦

58
00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.516
from suffering we can change.
和我们可以改变的痛苦。

59
00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:47.373
The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal,
前者是一个自然的， 生命中必不可少的一部分，

60
00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:52.511
and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow.
于是我们为自己预留空间，调整，成长。

61
00:03:54.833 --> 00:04:00.179
It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves.
能够认识到有比自己更强大的力量是件好事。

62
00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:04.042
They bring proportionality,
这能够带给我们均衡性，

63
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:06.385
like a cosmic right-sizing.
一个全新的自我认识。

64
00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.033
After my limbs were gone,
在我失去肢体之后，

65
00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:15.643
that loss, for example, became fact, fixed --
这个损失变成了一个事实，无法改变——

66
00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.980
necessarily part of my life,
这变成了我生活中的一部分，

67
00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:25.120
and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself.
我认识到抵触这个事实就是在抵触自己。

68
00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:29.614
It took me a while, but I learned it eventually.
过了一段时间，我才最终认识到这一点。

69
00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:32.836
Now, another great thing about necessary suffering
这种不可避免的痛苦的另一个好处

70
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.368
is that it is the very thing
是它最能够

71
00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:41.795
that unites caregiver and care receiver --
团结照顾者和被看护者——

72
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.072
human beings.
增进人与人之间的关系。

73
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.723
This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens.
我们意识到这就是痊愈的开始。

74
00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:53.013
Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday --
是的，同情——就像我们昨天所学的——

75
00:04:53.037 --> 00:04:54.465
suffering together.
一起承担。

76
00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:59.830
Now, on the systems side, on the other hand,
从另一方面，从医疗系统的角度来看，

77
00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:03.712
so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented.
有许多痛苦都是没有必要的，制造出来的。

78
00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:06.470
It serves no good purpose.
没有任何意义。

79
00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:10.795
But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up,
但是好消息是：既然这种痛苦是人为造成的，

80
00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.303
well, we can change it.
那我们就可以改变它。

81
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:16.155
How we die is indeed something we can affect.
如何死亡确实是我们可以改变的。

82
00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:22.319
Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction
让整个系统辨别不可避免的痛苦

83
00:05:22.343 --> 00:05:25.795
between necessary and unnecessary suffering
和没有必要的痛苦之间的最基本的区别

84
00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.509
gives us our first of three design cues for the day.
给予了我们三个中第一个的设计暗示。

85
00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:34.648
After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care,
毕竟我们作为照顾者的角色，

86
00:05:34.672 --> 00:05:39.334
is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile.
照顾病人是去减轻他的痛苦， 而不是雪上加霜。

87
00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:43.983
True to the tenets of palliative care,
这是缓和医疗的原则，

88
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:47.680
I function as something of a reflective advocate,
我的职责就是当一个支持者，

89
00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:49.823
as much as prescribing physician.
就像一个处方医生一样。

90
00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:57.018
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood --
顺便提一下：缓和医疗——是一个非常重要的 工作领域，但是经常被误解——

91
00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:59.996
while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care.
它涵盖，但不仅限于病人临终前。

92
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.861
It is not limited to hospice.
不仅限于安宁病房。

93
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.088
It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage.
而是在任何一个阶段 都有舒适的生活品质。

94
00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.858
So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon
所以不一定是在病人临终前

95
00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:11.569
to benefit from palliative care.
才能得到安宁缓和医疗。

96
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.550
Now, let me introduce you to Frank.
现在，让我给你们介绍一下弗兰克。

97
00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:18.803
Sort of makes this point.
他可以证明这一点。

98
00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:20.857
I've been seeing Frank now for years.
我照顾弗兰克好多年了。

99
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:25.075
He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV.
他患有前列腺癌，外加艾滋病。

100
00:06:26.017 --> 00:06:28.003
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,
我们针对治疗他的骨痛和疲倦问题，

101
00:06:28.027 --> 00:06:32.741
but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life --
但是我们大多时间都在一起思考他的人生——

102
00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.130
really, about our lives.
其实，就是我们的人生。

103
00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:36.551
In this way, Frank grieves.
弗兰克用这种方法表达他的悲痛。

104
00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:40.806
In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in,
他用这种方法面对他所失去的一切，

105
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.979
so that he's ready to take in the next moment.
这样他才能去面对下一个难题。

106
00:06:45.344 --> 00:06:49.515
Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another.
失去是一回事儿，而后悔是另一回事儿。

107
00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:53.020
Frank has always been an adventurer --
弗兰克一直是一个探险家——

108
00:06:53.044 --> 00:06:55.885
he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting --
他看上去像诺曼·洛克威尔的画里的人物——

109
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.473
and no fan of regret.
他从不后悔。

110
00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:01.067
So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day,
所以我一点都不惊讶有一天他来到诊所，

111
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:03.827
saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River.
跟我说他想泛竹筏从科罗拉多河顺流而下。

112
00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:06.637
Was this a good idea?
这是一个好主意吗？

113
00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:11.292
With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no.
考虑到他的人身安全和健康情况， 有些人会说这不行。

114
00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:14.882
Many did, but he went for it, while he still could.
很多人都这么说，但是他依旧去了， 趁他还有能力去的时候。

115
00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.430
It was a glorious, marvelous trip:
那是一个美好，奇妙的旅程：

116
00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:26.070
freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes,
冰凉的水，干热的酷暑，蝎子，蛇，

117
00:07:26.094 --> 00:07:31.525
wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon --
大峡谷似火的岩壁上各种野生动物的嚎叫——

118
00:07:31.549 --> 00:07:35.093
all the glorious side of the world beyond our control.
都是我们无法控制的世界的壮丽的一面。

119
00:07:36.312 --> 00:07:38.202
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,
弗兰克的决定，或许有些戏剧性，

120
00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:40.513
is exactly the kind so many of us would make,
但是如果我们有我们所需要的支持， 去寻找做最有利于自己的选择，

121
00:07:40.537 --> 00:07:46.734
if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.
那我们大多数人可能都会做出这样的选择。

122
00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:52.480
So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective.
今天聊到的许多都是从不同角度看问题。

123
00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:56.795
After my accident, when I went back to college,
在我的事故发生之后，我回到了大学，

124
00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:59.185
I changed my major to art history.
我把我的主修改成了艺术史。

125
00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:04.215
Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see --
在学习视觉艺术的过程中， 我发现我学会了如何去观察——

126
00:08:05.525 --> 00:08:08.899
a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change
对于一个无法改变过去所见的孩子来说，

127
00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:10.964
so much of what he was seeing.
那是强有力有的一课。

128
00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:16.160
Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with,
观点是一种人们可以改变的炼金术，

129
00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:18.694
turning anguish into a flower.
可以把煎熬变成花朵。

130
00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:25.611
Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco
往前快进： 现在我在旧金山一个很棒的地方工作，

131
00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:27.874
called the Zen Hospice Project,
叫做禅宗安宁病房项目。

132
00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:31.518
where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective.
在那里我们会举行一个小仪式 帮助我们换一个角度看问题。

133
00:08:32.225 --> 00:08:35.286
When one of our residents dies,
当我们的一个病人去世后，

134
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:39.780
the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden,
太平间的人会来， 当我们推他的遗体车穿过花园时，

135
00:08:39.804 --> 00:08:41.834
heading for the gate, we pause.
在大门前，我们会停留片刻。

136
00:08:41.858 --> 00:08:44.043
Anyone who wants --
任何人——

137
00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:46.791
fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers,
其他的住客，家人，护士，志愿者，

138
00:08:46.815 --> 00:08:49.259
the hearse drivers too, now --
还有灵车司机——

139
00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:53.710
shares a story or a song or silence,
如果他们愿意，他们会分享一段故事， 一首歌，或者简单的沉默，

140
00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.522
as we sprinkle the body with flower petals.
同时，我们在遗体上撒花瓣；

141
00:08:57.102 --> 00:08:59.406
It takes a few minutes;
只有几分钟的时间；

142
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.795
it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth,

143
00:09:04.819 --> 00:09:06.530
rather than repugnance.

144
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.926
Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting,

145

much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines
差不多跟这个一样——灯光照明的房间中 排满各种管子和嘟嘟叫的机器，

146
00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:22.006
and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has.
还有不停闪烁的灯光， 尽管病人的生命已经停止了。

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:26.265
Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away,
清理人员立即进来，遗体被快速地接走，

148

149
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.513
Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility,
从卫生角度考虑，他们的做法当然有道理，

150
00:09:35.537 --> 00:09:39.033
but hospitals tend to assault our senses,
但是医院很容易侵犯我们的感官，

151
00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:44.561
and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness --

152
00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:48.827
anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic.
麻木不仁，字面意思上和美感完全相反。

I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.

00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:02.849
They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.

They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.
它们不是应对生死的地方； 它们不是为这个而设计的。

157
00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:12.198
Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notion

158
00:10:12.222 --> 00:10:15.432
that our institutions can become more humane.

159

I spent a few months in a burn unit
我在在新泽西州利文斯顿的圣巴纳巴斯医院

We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle

in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen,

smell, a symbolic plane.

is design cue number two.

between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care,

even playful act.

"Play" may sound like a funny word here.

well, we invented music.

00:17:03.586 --> 00:17:06.795

what might we create with this fact?

267
00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:28.320
Rather, I am asking that we make space --

physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out --

280
00:18:11.068 --> 00:18:14.408
and I tell you it has been a liberation
当你意识到你在生命中

281
00:18:14.432 --> 00:18:17.587
to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning
永远可以找到 美好的事物和有意义的事情时，

282
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.878
in what life you have left,
我可以告诉你们这是一种解放。

283
00:18:19.902 --> 00:18:22.666
like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment,
就像那个停留在完美的一瞬间的雪球，

284
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.988
all the while melting away.
同时一直在融化。

285
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:32.539
If we love such moments ferociously,
如果我们能够拼尽全力去爱那些片刻，

286
00:18:32.563 --> 00:18:34.835
then maybe we can learn to live well --
也许我们就能学会如何活得更加精彩——

287
00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:36.946
not in spite of death,
不是不顾死亡而活得精彩，

288
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.556
but because of it.
而是因为死亡而活得精彩。

289
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.516
Let death be what takes us,
可以让死亡夺走我们的生命，

290
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.402
not lack of imagination.
但别让它带走我们的想象力。

291
00:18:48.688 --> 00:18:49.840
Thank you.
