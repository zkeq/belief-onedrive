00:00:18.797 --> 00:00:20.236
(Laughter)
（笑声）

4
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.366
I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days

5
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.976

and watching you interact with each other.

7
00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.519
And I think it's fair to say, already,
我想我已经可以大胆地说，

8
00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:36.731
that there are 47 people in this audience,
此时此刻，在你们中间，

9
00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:38.532
at this moment,
有47个人，

10
00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:43.367
displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.

11
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:44.738
(Laughter)

12
00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:47.764
And I thought you might like to know who you are.
我想你们都很想知道 到底是谁有精神病。

13
00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:49.211
(Laughter)
（笑声）

14
00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.922
But instead of pointing at you,
我不会直接指出来，

15
00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.144
which would be gratuitous and intrusive,
因为那样很没必要，也不礼貌，

16
00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:57.686
I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories,
我会列举一些事实和情况，

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.747
in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.
你们可以跟自己对照一下。

18
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.145
I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology,
我从事的是人格心理学研究，

19
00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:09.609
which is part of a larger personality science
它属于人格科学的范畴

20
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:14.742
which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives.
人格科学的研究领域跨度很大， 从神经元到叙述学。

21
00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:16.610
And what we try to do,
而我们的研究方向，

22
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:18.984
in our own way,
是用我们的方式，

23
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.752
is to make sense of how each of us --
来弄清楚，为什么 我们每一个人——

24
00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:23.839
each of you --
在座的每一位——

25
00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:26.365
is, in certain respects,
在某些方面，

26
00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.752
like all other people,
跟其他所有人都一样，

27
00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:30.197
like some other people
或者只跟部分人一样，

28
00:01:31.063 --> 00:01:33.081
and like no other person.
或者跟谁都不一样。

29
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.566
Now, already you may be saying of yourself,
也许你们会评价自己

30
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.335
"I'm not intriguing.
“我不是个有趣的人。

31
00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:46.866
I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."

32
00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:50.004
Or you may say of yourself,
也许你会评价自己，

33
00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:51.935
"I am intriguing,
“我是个有趣的人，

34
00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:57.023
even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."
尽管大部分人 都觉得我是个傻瓜。”

35
00:01:57.047 --> 00:01:58.237
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:04.121
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent "twitiness"
但正是你们这种自我认知的无聊 或者内在的“傻”，

37
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:08.572
that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you.
让我这个心理学家觉得非常有趣。

38
00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:11.343
So let me explain why this is so.
我来解释一下为什么。

39
00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:16.265
One of the most influential approaches in personality science
人格心理学中最有影响力的方法

40
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:17.879
is known as trait psychology,
叫做特质理论，

41
00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:23.272
and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed,
它用5个正态分布的维度判定你，

42
00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:30.286
and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people.
这5个维度描述了被广泛认同的人与人之间不同的5个方面。

43
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.528
They spell out the acronym OCEAN.
这5个方面的首字母缩写是OCEAN。

44
00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:36.976
So, "O" stands for "open to experience,"
“O”代表“开放性”，

45
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.351
versus those who are more closed.
与之对立的是 那些不愿冒险的人。

46
00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:42.550
"C" stands for "conscientiousness,"
“C”代表的是“责任感”，

47
00:02:42.574 --> 00:02:46.218
in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life.
与之相反的是 那些懒散随意的人。

48
00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:50.885
"E" -- "extroversion," in contrast to more introverted people.
“E”指的是“外向性”， 与之相对的是内向的人。

49
00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.601
"A" -- "agreeable individuals,"
“A”——“宜人性”

50
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:57.047
in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable.
与之相对的是 不那么和善的人。

51
00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.063
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals,"
最后是“N”—— “神经质”

52
00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:02.760
in contrast to those who are more stable.
与之相对的是那些 更加稳定平和的人。

53
00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:07.478
All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being,
这5个方面影响我们的健康，

54
00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:10.008
for how our life goes.
影响我们的人生走向。

55
00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:12.931
And so we know that, for example,
众所周知，

56
00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:17.930
openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success,
开放性和责任感 往往意味着成功，

57
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:23.026
but the open people achieve that success through being audacious
但开放的人在通往 成功之路上变得大胆，

58
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.228
and, occasionally, odd.
有时甚至古怪。

59
00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:30.262
The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines,
有责任感的人会紧守 最后期限，获得成功，

60
00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:34.208
to persevering, as well as having some passion.
他们坚持不懈，他们怀有激情。

61
00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:39.368
Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive
外向性和宜人性都有助于

62
00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:41.970
to working well with people.
与人和谐相处。

63
00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:45.674
Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing.
比如，外向的人， 我就觉得很有趣。

64
00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:48.681
With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact
在课堂上，我有时 会讲一个基本事实

65
00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:51.672
that might be revealing with respect to their personality:
能揭示人的性格特点：

66
00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:57.222
I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults
我说，一个成年人无法

67
00:03:57.246 --> 00:04:01.083
to lick the outside of their own elbow.
舔到他们的手肘外侧。

68
00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:02.361
(Laughter)
（笑声）

69
00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:03.769
Did you know that?
你们知道这事吗？

70
00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:09.514
Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow.
你们中有些人已经 尝试过舔自己的手肘外侧了。

71
00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:11.314
But extroverts amongst you

72
00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:13.949
are probably those who have not only tried,
不但已经尝试过（舔自己的手肘）

73
00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:16.463
but they have successfully licked the elbow
而且连坐他们旁边的人的手肘

74
00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:18.178
of the person sitting next to them.
也没有放过。

75
00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:19.204
(Laughter)
（笑声）

76
00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:20.913
Those are the extroverts.
这就是外向的人。

77
00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:24.356
Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion,
让我再讨论一下 外向性格的一些细节

78
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.339
because it's consequential and it's intriguing,
因为它影响深远而且很有意思，

79
00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:30.844
and it helps us understand what I call our three natures.
能帮我们理解人类的三种天性。

80
00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:34.539
First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology.
第一种是生物学天性—— 我们的神经生理学。

81
00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.546
Second, our sociogenic or second nature,
第二种是社会学天性， 又叫第二天性，

82
00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.957
which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.
与我们的文化和社会属性相关。

83
00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:49.467
And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic --
而第三种，让你成为独一无二的“你”

84
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.056
what I call your "idiogenic" nature.
我称之为场景特定天性。

85
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.236
Let me explain.
下面我来解释一下。

86
00:04:56.721 --> 00:05:00.206
One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.
外向性格的人的一大特征 就是他们需要刺激。

87
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:05.515
And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting:
这种刺激可以是令人兴奋的事：

88
00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.576
loud noises, parties and social events here at TED --
比如巨大的声响、热闹的聚会 和TED这样的社交事件——

89
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.827
you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.
你会发现外向者会形成 一个磁性的内核。

90
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:14.510
They all gather together.
他们会聚集到一起。

91
00:05:14.534 --> 00:05:15.949
And I've seen you.
所以我才会在这里遇见你们。

92
00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:19.296
The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces
而内向的人更喜欢上到二楼

93
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.143
up on the second floor,
找个安静的地方待着，

94
00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:24.959
where they are able to reduce stimulation --
以减少外界刺激——

95
00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.918
and may be misconstrued as being antisocial,
这样做可能会被 误认为不喜欢社交，

96
00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:31.940
but you're not necessarily antisocial.
但其实这并不绝对。

97
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.028
It may be that you simply realize that you do better
也许你只是单纯地知道

98
00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:41.667
when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.
自己在外界刺激较低 的时候状态更好。

99
00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:46.966
Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body.
这也包括内在刺激， 来自你的体内。

100
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.905
Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts.
比如说，咖啡因有时候对外向的人 比内向的人更有效。

101
00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:55.108
When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning
当外向者早上9点走进办公室，

102
00:05:55.132 --> 00:05:58.017
and say, "I really need a cup of coffee,"
说，“我需要一杯咖啡。”

103
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.192
they're not kidding --
他们没开玩笑——

104
00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:00.389
they really do.
他们是真需要。

105
00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:03.157
Introverts do not do as well,
内向者就不会这么做，

106
00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:05.698
particularly if the tasks they're engaged in --
尤其是当他们正在干的活儿——

107
00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.278
and they've had some coffee --
而且他们已经喝过咖啡了——

108
00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:10.440
if those tasks are speeded,
如果这些活儿很急，

109
00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:12.343
and if they're quantitative,
而且有量化标准，

110
00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:16.761
introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative.
内向者会表现得好像 这些活儿没有特别的量化标准。

111
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.040
But it's a misconstrual.
但这是一种误导。

112
00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:22.108
So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing:
因此我们能得出一些 非常有趣的结论：

113
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.215
we're not always what seem to be,
我们经常会表里不一，

114
00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:27.523
and that takes me to my next point.
这就引出了我下一个观点。

115
00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:30.572
I should say, before getting to this,
我事先声明，我要说的，

116
00:06:30.596 --> 00:06:33.276
something about sexual intercourse,
是关于做爱的事情，

117
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.401
although I may not have time.
但我的时间可能不太够。

118
00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:38.297
And so, if you would like me to --
所以，如果你们想让我说的话——

119
00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:39.472
yes, you would?
什么？你们很想听？

120
00:06:39.496 --> 00:06:40.647
OK.
好吧。

121
00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:41.786
(Laughter)
（笑声）

122
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.940
There are studies done
有人做过，

123
00:06:42.964 --> 00:06:48.289
on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act,
关于人做爱频率的研究，

124
00:06:49.226 --> 00:06:52.465
as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert.
分类标准有男性、女性、 内向者、外向者。

125
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.071
So I ask you:
我想问大家：

126
00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:56.167
How many times per minute --
每分钟做多少次——

127
00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:58.866
oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --
哦，对不起，每分钟多少次 说的是老鼠——

128
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.897
(Laughter)
（笑声）

129
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.773
How many times per month
内向的男性

130
00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:09.794
do introverted men engage in the act?
每个月有多少次性行为？

131
00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:11.696
3.0.

132

More or less?

Yes, more.
没错，更多。

135
00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:19.794
5.5 -- almost twice as much.
5.5次，差不多是2倍。

136
00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:23.652
Introverted women: 3.1.
内向的女性：3.1次。

137
00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.272
Extroverted women?
外向的女性呢？

138
00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:28.642
Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,
老实说，作为一个内向的男性，

139
00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:30.403
which I will explain later --
——关于这一点我稍后会解释——

140
00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:32.008

(Applause)
（掌声）

146
00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:52.917
We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts.
外向者和内向者的交流方式有所不同。

147
00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:55.902
Extroverts, when they interact,

148
00:07:55.926 --> 00:08:00.391
want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness.

They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication.

152
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:10.268
We found in some research
有研究表明

153
00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:13.290
that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody.
外向者更喜欢使用昵称。

154
00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:16.406
So when an extrovert meets a Charles,

155
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.315
it rapidly becomes "Charlie," and then "Chuck,"

156
00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.018
and then "Chuckles Baby."

157
00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.534
(Laughter)
（笑声）

158
00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.257
Whereas for introverts,
而内向者呢，

159
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:29.186
it remains "Charles," until he's given a pass to be more intimate

160
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.430
by the person he's talking to.

161
00:08:31.864 --> 00:08:34.649
We speak differently.

外向者喜欢确定、 具体、简洁的语言。

163
00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:47.468
Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you

164
00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:51.849
that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine --

165
00:08:52.673 --> 00:08:54.390
we speak differently.

166
00:08:54.414 --> 00:08:58.409

167
00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:00.365
contingent,
模棱两可，

168
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:02.405
weasel-word sentences --
云山雾罩的话——

169
00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:03.452
(Laughter)
（笑声）

170
00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:04.838
More or less.
或多或少吧。

171
00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:06.641
(Laughter)
（笑声）

172
00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:07.865
As it were.
基本是这样。

173
00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:08.904
(Laughter)
（笑声）

174
00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:10.928
Not to put too fine a point upon it --
不把话说死——

175
00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:12.841
like that.
就像刚才那样。

176
00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:15.177
When we talk,

we sometimes talk past each other.

178
00:09:17.544 --> 00:09:20.172
I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague

179
00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:23.200
who's as different from me as two people can possibly be.

Mine isn't.

182
00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:28.828

Secondly, he's six foot five.

I overload so much,

I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon

190
00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:49.335
and expect to sleep in the evening.

191
00:09:49.998 --> 00:09:53.950
We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael.
我们还有一个助手，叫麦克。

192
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.312
And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt.

193
00:10:00.348 --> 00:10:04.144
So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me,

"What do you make of Michael?"

Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.

He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese."
他的回答是非常典型的外向型。

197
00:10:11.775 --> 00:10:15.350
And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said,
而我的回答嘛，其实在外向者听来，

198
00:10:15.374 --> 00:10:17.327
which is actually pretty accurate.
应该是非常精确的。

199
00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:21.611
I said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times
我说，“其实，麦克有时候

200
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.491
of behaving in a way that some of us might see
的一些做法， 在我们某些人看来

201
00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:30.444
as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."

202
00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:33.071
(Laughter)
（笑声）

203
00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:35.208
Tom rolled his eyes and he said,

204
00:10:35.232 --> 00:10:37.761
"Brian, that's what I said:

205
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:39.849
he's an asshole!"

206
00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:42.050
(Laughter)
（笑声）

207
00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.895
(Applause)
（掌声）

208
00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:46.596
Now, as an introvert,
作为一名内向者，

209
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.801
I might gently allude to certain "assholic" qualities
我也许会委婉地暗示， 这个人的行为

210
00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:53.120
in this man's behavior,
确实比较混蛋，

211
00:10:53.144 --> 00:10:55.948
but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.
但我不会直接使用“混蛋”这个词。

212
00:10:55.972 --> 00:10:57.748
(Laughter)
（笑声）

213
00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:00.314
But the extrovert says,
但外向者会说，

214
00:11:00.338 --> 00:11:03.212
"If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."
“如果他表现得像个混蛋， 我就会称他混蛋。”

215
00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:04.648
And we go past each other.
这就是我们的不同。

216
00:11:05.318 --> 00:11:09.284
Now is this something that we should be heedful of?
这一点我们是不是需要留意呢？

217
00:11:09.308 --> 00:11:10.474
Of course.
那是当然。

218
00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:12.082
It's important that we know this.
这一点非常重要。

219
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:13.645
Is that all we are?
但这就完了吗？

220
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.531
Are we just a bunch of traits?
我们就只有这几种特点吗？

221
00:11:17.383 --> 00:11:18.645
No, we're not.
并非如此。

222
00:11:19.936 --> 00:11:22.192
Remember, you're like some other people
别忘了，你们跟一些人很像

223
00:11:23.086 --> 00:11:24.795
and like no other person.
但又独一无二。

224
00:11:25.307 --> 00:11:27.742
How about that idiosyncratic you?
这个独一无二的你 到底是什么样的呢？

225
00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:31.556
As Elizabeth or as George,
伊丽莎白们或者乔治们，

226
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.460
you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism.
你们可能都有些 外向或者神经过敏。

227
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:40.078
But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior,

228
00:11:40.102 --> 00:11:42.299
or Georgian of yours,
或者乔治独有的特点，

229
00:11:43.552 --> 00:11:47.402
that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits?
能让我们更好地了解你？ 而不是简单地对号入座？

230
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.463
That make us love you?
能让我们喜欢上你？

231
00:11:51.281 --> 00:11:54.275
Not just because you're a certain type of person.
不仅仅因为你是 某种特定类型的人。

232
00:11:55.008 --> 00:11:57.632
I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes.
我不喜欢把人放进鸽子笼里， 然后贴上标签。

233
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:01.492
I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes.
我甚至觉得鸽子 都不应该待在鸽子笼里。

234
00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.124
So what is it that makes us different?
究竟是什么让我们与众不同呢？

235
00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:10.721
It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects.
是我们一生的所作所为—— 我们的个人事业。

236
00:12:11.223 --> 00:12:13.044
You have a personal project right now,
你们大家都有个人事业，

237
00:12:13.068 --> 00:12:16.154
but nobody may know it here.
但可能谁都没有意识到。

238
00:12:17.324 --> 00:12:19.132
It relates to your kid --
也许这事业跟孩子有关——

239
00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.356
you've been back three times to the hospital,
你已经去医院三趟了，

240
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.276
and they still don't know what's wrong.
医生们还是查不出你孩子的病因。

241
00:12:25.193 --> 00:12:26.517
Or it could be your mom.
或者生病的是你母亲。

242
00:12:27.912 --> 00:12:30.014
And you'd been acting out of character.
你会做一些跟你的 性格不相符的事情。

243
00:12:30.038 --> 00:12:31.600
These are free traits.

244
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.421
You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably
你本和善可亲， 却表现得咄咄逼人，

245
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:40.318
in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor
只为了对抗如今医院里 无处不在的

246
00:12:40.342 --> 00:12:41.493
in the hospital,
懒散风气，

247
00:12:41.517 --> 00:12:44.143
to get something for your mom or your child.
让自己的母亲 或者孩子得到及时治疗。

248
00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:47.141
What are these free traits?

249
00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:49.735
They're where we enact a script
那是我们演的一出戏，

250
00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:52.412
in order to advance a core project in our lives.
为了达成我们生命中 最重要的目标。

251
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:55.622
And they are what matters.
而这才是最重要的。

252
00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:57.918
Don't ask people what type you are;
不要问别人是什么性格的人，

253
00:12:58.562 --> 00:13:01.316
ask them, "What are your core projects in your life?"
而要问他们，“你们生命中 最重要的事是什么？”

254
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.124
And we enact those free traits.
然后我们身上的可变 性格特点就会被激发。

255
00:13:03.148 --> 00:13:04.463
I'm an introvert,
我是一个内向的人，

256
00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:09.073
but I have a core project, which is to profess.

and I adore my field.

what I can't wait to tell them about.

262
00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:27.282
And so I act in an extroverted way,

263
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.834
because at eight in the morning,

264
00:13:28.858 --> 00:13:31.202
the students need a little bit of humor,

00:13:33.972 --> 00:13:35.423
in arduous days of study.

267
00:13:36.097 --> 00:13:37.534
But we need to be very careful
但是当我们扮演 其他性格的时候

268
00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.232
when we act protractedly out of character.
需要万分小心。

269
00:13:42.499 --> 00:13:47.231
Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves.
（因为）有时候我们 对自己太狠。

270
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:53.743
I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior,
我发现自己在假装 外向性格一段时间之后，

271
00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:56.067
I need to repair somewhere on my own.
我需要自己躲起来疗伤。

272
00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.855
As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,
就像苏珊•凯恩在 《安静》这本书中所写，

273
00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:03.851
in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor
其中一章提到一位 古怪的加拿大教授，

274

who was teaching at the time at Harvard,

I sometimes go to the men's room

277
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:13.973
(Laughter)
（笑声）

278
00:14:13.997 --> 00:14:20.369
I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle,
有一次我自己 也躲进了小隔间，

279
00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.318
trying to avoid overstimulation.
为了暂避外界纷扰。

280
00:14:22.937 --> 00:14:28.184
And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle,
这时来了一个外向者，到我旁边， ——当然不是在一个小隔间

281
00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:30.163
but in the next cubicle over --
是在我旁边的小隔间——

282
00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:32.510
and I could hear various evacuatory noises,
我听见了一连串物体 落水的声音，

283
00:14:32.534 --> 00:14:34.803
which we hate -- even our own,
这声音是很烦人的 ——哪怕是我们自己的，

284
00:14:34.827 --> 00:14:37.557
that's why we flush during as well as after.
所以我们才会在 上大号的中途也冲水。

285
00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:39.313
(Laughter)
（笑声）

286
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.770
And then I heard this gravelly voice saying,
随后我就听到了 一个沙哑的声音，

287
00:14:44.794 --> 00:14:47.229
"Hey, is that Dr. Little?"
“嘿，请问是利特尔博士吗？”

288
00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.182
(Laughter)
（笑声）

289
00:14:50.484 --> 00:14:56.851
If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months,
如果有什么事情 能让内向者便秘6个月，

290
00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:58.636
it's talking on the john.
那一定是在上大号的时候聊天。

291
00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.890
(Laughter)
（笑声）

292
00:14:59.914 --> 00:15:02.014
That's where I'm going now.
我现在就想去洗手间静静。

293
00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:03.872
Don't follow me.
