29

I could be a mother and a journalist.

that is when I hit a wall.

So, I want you to picture this:

you host a podcast, and you have to prove

My goal was to increase my audience size tenfold.

as you do,
和你们一样，

42

43
00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:13.553
This was different than writer's block, right?
这和作家的文思枯竭不一样，对吧？

44
00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:16.652
It wasn't like there was something there waiting to be unearthed.

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.393
When was the last time I actually had a good idea?

I checked the headlines while I waited for my latte.

51
00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:36.926
I updated my calendar while I was sitting on the couch.

what a responsive person I was,

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.644
I realized that I was never bored.
我发现我从没感觉到无聊过。

58
00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:56.438
And anyway, don't only boring people get bored?
不过，不是只有 无聊的人才会觉得无聊吗？

59
00:02:57.028 --> 00:02:58.410
But then I started to wonder:
但是我开始好奇：

60
00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:00.696
What actually happens to us when we get bored?

Or, more importantly: What happens to us if we never get bored?

62
00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:09.872
And what could happen if we got rid of this human emotion entirely?

63
00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:14.147
I started talking to neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists,

and what they told me was fascinating.

65
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.913
It turns out that when you get bored,

66
00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:23.021
you ignite a network in your brain called the "default mode."
你大脑里一个叫做“默认模式”的 系统被点亮了。

67
00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:27.904
So our body, it goes on autopilot while we're folding the laundry

68
00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:29.295
or we're walking to work,
我们的身体开启了自动巡航，

69
00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.280
but actually that is when our brain gets really busy.
但我们的大脑却非常忙碌。

70
00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:35.176
Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.

74
00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:44.600
a little bit into the subconscious,

75
00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.796
which allows sort of different connections to take place.

76
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.310
It's really awesome, actually.

So this is my brain in an fMRI,
这是我的大脑在 功能磁共振成像中的样子。

79
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:58.044
and I learned that in the default mode is when we connect disparate ideas,

we solve some of our most nagging problems,
我们解决了一些 最让人困扰的问题，

81
00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:03.643
and we do something called "autobiographical planning."

82
00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.562
This is when we look back at our lives,

83
00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:08.785

or replying to email.

88
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.427
We call it "getting shit done,"
我们把这个叫做“把事情做完”，

89
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:25.489
but here's what neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Levitin says
但是照神经学家Daniel Levitin博士所说，

90
00:04:25.513 --> 00:04:26.829
we're actually doing.
我们做的事其实是这样的。

from one thing to another,

93
00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:34.655
the brain has to engage a neurochemical switch

94
00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.910
that uses up nutrients in the brain to accomplish that.

95
00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:40.353
So if you're attempting to multitask,

96
00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:42.700
you know, doing four or five things at once,

you're not actually doing four or five things at once,

98
00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.214
because the brain doesn't work that way.

99
00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:50.089
Instead, you're rapidly shifting from one thing to the next,

100
00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:52.156
depleting neural resources as you go.
同时将神经能源消耗殆尽。

(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch, you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.
（声音）MZ：转换来，转换去，再转换回来， 你在消耗糖分，糖分，还是糖分。

102
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:59.308
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have a limited supply of that stuff.
（声音）DL：完全正确， 而且我们能提供的糖分是有限的。

I discovered all this talking to professor of informatics,

they tend to shift their attention more rapidly.

114
00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:32.131
We also found, strangely enough,
我们同时发现，非常奇怪的是，

115
00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:37.855
that the shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.975
the more likely they are to check Facebook.

117
00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.041
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.

118
00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:46.163
MZ: But could this cycle be broken?

What would happen if we broke this vicious cycle?

Maybe my listeners could help me find out.

What if we reclaimed those cracks in our day?

Could it help us jump-start our creativity?

We called the project "Bored and Brilliant."
