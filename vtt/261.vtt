to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century.

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:29.608
of poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction --
比如贫穷、不平等、疾病、 失业、暴力、吸毒等等，

6
00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:32.458
they're right there in one person's life.
恰好都发生在同一个人身上。

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:36.163
So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know.
我认识的一个人正是如此。

8
00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:38.256
I'm going to call her Ella.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.986
Ella lives in a British city on a run down estate.

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.204
The shops are closed, the pub's gone,

11
00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:46.527
the playground's pretty desolate and never used,

12
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:49.377
and inside Ella's house, the tension is palpable

13
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:51.401
and the noise levels are deafening.
吵闹不堪。

14
00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:53.239
The TV's on at full volume.

另一个儿子，瑞恩， 不停地在厨房骂骂咧咧，

Ella is stuck.

She has lived with crisis for 40 years.

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:10.873
She knows nothing else, and she knows no way out.

She's had a whole series of abusive partners,

22
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.887
and, tragically, one of her children has been taken into care by social services.
可悲的是，其中一个孩子还被福利院带走了。

23
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.183
The three children that still live with her

24
00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:23.682
suffer from a whole range of problems, and none of them are in education.

25
00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.703
And Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle
艾拉跟我说，她的人生是

26
00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:29.491
of her own mother's life before her.
在重蹈她母亲的覆辙。

27
00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:32.795
But when I met Ella, there were 73 different services
然而当我遇见艾拉的时候， 她和家人生活的城市

28
00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.957
on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives,
有73家不同的社会福利机构 可以为他们提供帮助。

29
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:40.250
73 different services run out of 24 departments in one city,
这73家福利机构 分属该市24个不同的部门，

30
00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:43.584
and Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them.
而大多数部门对艾拉一家 的情况非常了解。

31
00:01:43.608 --> 00:01:45.722
They think nothing of calling social services
而他们一家从未想过要找这些部门，

32
00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:48.598
to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out.
来调解他们家庭的矛盾。

33
00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:51.855
And the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers,
其实有很多人会定期到她家走访，比如社工，

34
00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:56.845
youth workers, a health officer, a housing officer, a home tutor
青少年社工，卫生官员， 房屋事务官员，家庭教师

35
00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.795
and the local policemen.
还有当地的警察。

36
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.557
And the governments say that there are 100,000 families
政府表示，目前在英国有10万个

37
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:03.680
in Britain today like Ella's,
像艾拉这样的家庭。

38
00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:09.065
struggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation.
他们在贫困中挣扎，试图摆脱因经济、 社会和环境资源缺乏带来的恶性循环。

39
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.263
And they also say that managing this problem
政府还表示，为了解决上述问题，

40
00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:14.289
costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year
他们每年在每个家庭身上 要花费25万英镑，

41
00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:15.685
and yet nothing changes.
然而毫无作用。

42
00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.795
None of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference.
这些好心的家访者并没有发挥作用。

43
00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.102
This is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's.
这张图表显示的是我们为该市另外一个 类似艾拉家的家庭所做的事情。

44
00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.728
This shows 30 years of intervention in that family's life.
它记录了30年来（福利机构） 对其家庭生活的干预。

45
00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:30.583
And just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan.
正如艾拉一样，这些干预都不成体系。

46
00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.054
There's no end goal in sight.
缺乏明确的最终目标。

47
00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:35.129
None of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues.
没有着眼于解决根本问题。

48
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:38.183
These are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem.
只是一些应对措施，治标不治本。

49
00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:39.906
One of the policemen says to me,
一位警官告诉我，

50
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.419
"Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave."
“我只是带个口信然后就走。”

51
00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:45.128
So, I've spent time living with families like Ella's
因此，我去了很多不同的地方，

52
00:02:45.152 --> 00:02:46.692
in different parts of the world,
跟像艾拉一样的家庭生活在一起。

53
00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:48.954
because I want to know: what can we learn
因为我想搞清楚：在社会福利机构

54
00:02:48.978 --> 00:02:52.471
from places where our social institutions just aren't working?
鞭长莫及的地方，到底发生了些什么？

55
00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:55.286
I want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family.
我想搞清楚，在艾拉家里 生活是一种什么感受。

56
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.321
I want to know what's going on and what we can do differently.
我想搞清楚，我们能做些什么来改变现状。

57
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:03.434
Well, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept.
我弄明白的第一件事就是， “支出”是一个模糊的概念。

58
00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.176
Because when the government says that a family like Ella's
因为当政府说，像艾拉这样的家庭，

59
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.681
costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage,
每年要花费政府25万英镑的时候，

60
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:09.972
what it really means
真正的含义是指，

61
00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:12.966
is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year.
维持福利系统运转， 每年需要花费25万英镑。

62
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.105
Because not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family
而这些钱并没有用在艾拉身上，

63
00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.709
in a way that makes a difference.
使她家的情况产生好转。

64
00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:20.276
Instead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope
恰恰相反，福利体系就像一个昂贵的陀螺仪

65
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.279
that spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart,
不停地在这些家庭周围旋转， 把它们困在其中，

66
00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.328
exactly where they are.
原地踏步。

67
00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.675
And I also spent time with the frontline workers,
我还和一线社工交流过，

68
00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.522
and I learned that it is an impossible situation.
我了解到这种情况根本无法好转。

69
00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:35.261
So Tom, who is the social worker for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,
汤姆是一名社工，他负责 艾拉14岁的儿子瑞恩，

70
00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:38.795
has to spend 86 percent of his time servicing the system:
他将自己86%的时间用于服务系统：

71
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.890
meetings with colleagues, filling out forms,
跟同事开会，填写表格，

72
00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:43.342
more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms,
继续跟同事开会研究怎么填写表格，

73
00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:44.612
and maybe most shockingly,
而更让人震惊的是，

74
00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:47.205
the 14 percent of the time he has to be with Ryan
剩下的14%的时间， 即使他与瑞恩在一块儿，

75
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.725
is spent getting data and information for the system.
也是在为系统获取数据和信息。

76
00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:50.900
So he says to Ryan,
他问瑞恩，

77
00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:53.611
"How often have you been smoking? Have you been drinking?
“你多久抽一次烟？ 你有喝酒吗？

78
00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:54.948
When did you go to school?"
你什么时候去上学？”

79
00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:57.522
And this kind of interaction rules out the possibility
在这种交流方式下，怎么可能

80
00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:58.758
of a normal conversation.
进行正常的对话呢。

81
00:03:58.782 --> 00:04:00.900
It rules out the possibility of what's needed
它完全抹杀了在汤姆和瑞恩之间

82
00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:03.901
to build a relationship between Tom and Ryan.
建立正常的人际关系的可能性。

83
00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.208
When we made this chart,
当我制作这张图表的时候，

84
00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:08.247
the frontline workers, the professionals --
这些一线社工，专业人士们，

85
00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:10.042
they stared at it absolutely amazed.
他们看着这张图表，大吃一惊。

86
00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:12.795
It snaked around the walls of their offices.
数据曲线在他们办公室的墙上起起伏伏。

87
00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.795
So many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile.
花费如此多的时间，怀揣如此美好的愿望，结果一事无成。

88
00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:22.259
And there was this moment of absolute breakdown,
他们在这一刻彻底醒悟了，

89
00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:24.115
and then of clarity:
他们清楚意识到：

90
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.752
we had to work in a different way.
必须要改变工作方式。

91
00:04:27.472 --> 00:04:30.777
So in a really brave step, the leaders of the city where Ella lives
艾拉所在城市的领导者走出了勇敢的一步，

92
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.446
agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio.
同意我们将服务于系统的时间和 服务于瑞恩的时间比例调转。

93
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.630
So everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's
于是每一位接触艾拉或类似家庭的社工，

94
00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:39.566
would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families
必须用80%的时间服务于家庭，

95
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.155
and only 20 percent servicing the system.
剩下的20%时间服务于系统。

96
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:44.030
And even more radically,
更加重要的一点是，

97
00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:45.224
the families would lead
家庭拥有决定权，

98
00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:48.575
and they would decide who was in a best position to help them.
决定谁最有资格来帮助他们。

99
00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.958
So Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel,
于是艾拉和另一位母亲加入了评审小组，

100
00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:54.305
to choose from amongst the existing professionals
从现有的专业人士中挑选

101
00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:56.596
who would work with them.
为自己服务的人。

102
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.586
And many, many people wanted to join us,
很多人想加入我们，

103
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.681
because you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system,
因为你不是为了维持系统 而加入这个工作，

104
00:05:01.705 --> 00:05:04.558
you go in because you can and you want to make a difference.
而是因为你能也想为艾拉他们带来改变。

105
00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:07.795
So Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door,
于是艾拉和这位母亲问 每一个参加评审的人，

106
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.251
"What will you do when my son starts kicking me?"
“如果你发现我儿子在踢打我，你会怎么办？”

107
00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:12.795
And so the first person who comes in says,
第一个面试者说，

108
00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.938
"Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit
“我会找到最近的一个出口，

109
00:05:14.962 --> 00:05:17.795
and I will back out very slowly,
慢慢地退出去，

110
00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.820
and if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor."
如果事情还没有停止， 我会通知我的上司。”

111
00:05:20.844 --> 00:05:23.557
And the mothers go, "You're the system. Get out of here!"
这位母亲说， “你只是在为体制工作。请你出去！”

112
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.795
And then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says,
下一个进来的是一名警官，他说，

113
00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.795
"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do."
“嗯，我会把你儿子摁倒在地， 但我不确定接下来我应该做什么。”

114
00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.497
And the mothers say, "Thank you."
母亲说，“谢谢你。”

115
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:34.743
So, they chose professionals who confessed
于是，她们选择的是那些

116
00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:36.737
they didn't necessarily have the answers,
可以坦诚自己未必有什么办法的人，

117
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:40.350
who said -- well, they weren't going to talk in jargon.
那些不会说套话的人。

118
00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:43.263
They showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers
他们展现出的人性让这两位母亲相信，

119
00:05:42.917 --> 00:05:44.714
that they would stick with them through thick and thin,
他们无论如何都会与自己同在，

120
00:05:44.714 --> 00:05:47.267
even though they wouldn't be soft with them.
同时也不会过分纵容自己。

121
00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:49.203
So these new teams and the families
尽管新的团队和家庭

122
00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:51.882
were then given a sliver of the former budget,
只获得了之前预算的一小部分，

123
00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:54.397
but they could spend the money in any way they chose.
但他们有权决定如何使用这笔钱。

124
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.656
And so one of the families went out for supper.
于是其中一家人选择出去吃晚饭。

125
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.285
They went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened
他们去了麦当劳，围坐在一起， 谈天说地，

126
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:02.369
for the first time in a long time.
这是很久以来的第一次。

127
00:06:01.213 --> 00:06:04.013
Another family asked the team
另一家人询问社工团队，

128
00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:07.049
if they would help them do up their home.
能否帮他们修缮一下房子。

129
00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:08.580
And one mother took the money
还有一位母亲用这钱

130
00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:12.131
and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise.
作为备用金，开办了一家社企。

131
00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:14.604
And in a really short space of time,
在短短时间内，

132
00:06:14.628 --> 00:06:17.037
something new started to grow:
就出现了一些新气象：

133
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.959
a relationship between the team and the workers.
社工团队和家庭间建立了联系。

134
00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.900
And then some remarkable changes took place.
之后又发生了一些显著的变化。

135
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.444
Maybe it's not surprising
也许艾拉在这个过程中，

136
00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:27.202
that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards
经历了许多起起伏伏，

137
00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:28.427
as well as forwards.
这一点也不奇怪。

138
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:31.176
But today, she's completed an IT training course,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.488
she has her first paid job, her children are back in school,

are fine.

They've made some new friendships.

145
00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:47.165
And all the same people have been involved in this transformation --

146
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.795
same families, same workers.

147
00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.726
But the relationship between them has been supported to change.

148
00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:57.457
So I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships

149
00:06:57.481 --> 00:06:59.418
are the critical resource we have

But today, our relationships are all but written off

152
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.458
by our politics, our social policies, our welfare institutions.
被我们的福利政策 和福利机构所破坏了。

153
00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:11.158
And I've learned that this really has to change.
我意识到这必须发生改变。

154
00:07:11.822 --> 00:07:13.772
So what do I mean by relationships?
到底什么是人际关系？

155
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:17.235
I'm talking about the simple human bonds between us,

156
00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.795
a kind of authentic sense of connection, of belonging,

to be brave like Ella and try something new.

159
00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.275
And, you know, it's no accident

160
00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:29.838
that those who run and work in the institutions

161
00:07:29.862 --> 00:07:32.120
that are supposed to support Ella and her family

162
00:07:32.144 --> 00:07:33.658
don't talk about relationships,
从来不谈论人际关系，

163
00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:37.754
because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model

164
00:07:37.778 --> 00:07:41.236
that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world.
而这一福利模式是在英国 出现并传遍世界的。

165
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.193

who was the architect of the first welfare state

and the author of the Beveridge Report,

168
00:07:47.443 --> 00:07:50.942
had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man.
当时的人们不相信富有人情味的普通人，

169
00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:54.410
Instead, they trusted this idea of the impersonal system
转而相信缺乏人情味的系统，

170
00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:58.795
and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system.
以及在系统中工作的官员们。

171
00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:00.934
And the impact of Beveridge

172
00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.201
on the way the modern state sees social issues

just can't be underestimated.

The Beveridge Report sold over 100,000 copies

176
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:14.070
People queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy,
人们在11月的雨夜排队购买，

177
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.754

很快这份报告就传遍了全国， 传遍了殖民地，传遍了欧洲，

178
00:08:16.754 --> 00:08:18.949
across the United States of America,

and it had this huge impact

180
00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:24.642
on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe.
产生了巨大的影响。

181
00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:29.727
The cultures, the bureaucracies, the institutions -- they are global,
（福利）文化、体制、机构， 在全球得到推广，

182
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:31.771
and they've come to seem like common sense.
逐渐成为了一种普遍现象。

183
00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:33.879
They've become so ingrained in us,
它们如此根深蒂固，

184
00:08:33.903 --> 00:08:36.150
that actually we don't even see them anymore.
以至于我们开始对其熟视无睹。

185
00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:39.795
And I think it's really important to say that in the 20th century,
我认为应该强调的是，在20世纪，

186
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:42.456
they were remarkably successful, these institutions.
这些福利机构的出现，是一种巨大的成功。

187
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.911
They led to longer lifespans, the eradication of mass disease,
（社会福利）延长了人们的寿命， 消除了大范围流行疾病

188
00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:48.926
mass housing, almost universal education.
提供了住房，普及了教育。

189
00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:51.795
But at the same time,
但与此同时，

190
00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:55.251
Beveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges.
贝弗里奇也埋下了今天种种问题的种子。

191
00:08:55.819 --> 00:08:57.583
So let me tell you a second story.
接下来我要讲第二个故事。

192
00:08:57.607 --> 00:09:02.819
What do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking?
你认为如今比终身吸烟 更加可怕的健康杀手是什么？

193
00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:06.654
It's loneliness.
是孤独。

194
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:12.477
According to government statistics, one person over 60 -- one in three --
根据政府统计，60岁以上的人中， 有三分之一

195
00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:15.693
doesn't speak to or see another person in a week.
在一周内不与人交流。

196
00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:19.795
One person in 10, that's 850,000 people,
十分之一的人，也就是85万人，

197
00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:22.154
doesn't speak to anyone else in a month.
甚至在一个月内不跟人交流。

198
00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:25.018
And we're not the only people with this problem;
这种情况不仅发生在我们国家，

199
00:09:24.532 --> 00:09:26.917
this problem touches the whole of the Western world.
在整个西方世界都是如此。

200
00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:29.449
And it's even more acute in countries like China,
而在中国，形势更加严峻，

201
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.502
where a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people
中国在经历迅速的城市化过程， 大量人口涌入城市，

202
00:09:33.526 --> 00:09:35.070
alone in the villages.
村里只留下老人。

203
00:09:35.094 --> 00:09:38.915
And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported --
而贝弗里奇设计和推广的福利体系，

204
00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:41.226
they can't address this kind of problem.
根本无法预见这样的问题。

205
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.860
Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge,
孤独就像“人际关系危机综合症”，

206
00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:47.731
and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response.
靠传统的行政手段根本无法解决。

207
00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:51.257
So some years ago, wanting to understand this problem,
于是几年前，为了研究这一问题，

208
00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:54.154
I started to work with a group of about 60 older people
我在自己生活的伦敦城南， 与一群老年人共同生活，

209
00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:55.999
in South London, where I live.
他们大约有60人。

210
00:09:56.023 --> 00:09:58.098
I went shopping, I played bingo,
我跟他们一起购物，玩bingo游戏，

211
00:09:58.122 --> 00:10:00.285
but mainly I was just observing and listening.
但大部分时间我只是观察和倾听。

212
00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:02.854
I wanted to know what we could do differently.
我想知道我们该如何改变。

213
00:10:03.657 --> 00:10:06.485
And if you ask them, people tell you they want two things.
如果你问他们有何需求，他们会提到两件事。

214
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.418
They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb,
他们希望有人能替他们爬梯子换灯泡，

215
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.740
or to be there when they come out of hospital.
或是从医院出来时有人接。

216
00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:14.118
They want on-demand, practical support.
他们渴望实际的帮助。

217
00:10:14.142 --> 00:10:15.700
And they want to have fun.
他们想过得快乐。

218
00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:18.942
They want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people,
他们想与志趣相投的人一起出门找乐子，

219
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:22.686
and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives.
想结交新的朋友，就像我们大家一样， 无论处在什么年龄。

220
00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:26.027
So we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen,
于是我们开通了一条热线， 雇了一群能干的人，

221
00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:28.388
and started a service we called "Circle."
（为老人家）提供服务，我们称之为“圈子”。

222
00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:32.233
And Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number
“圈子”为当地的会员开通了免费的0800电话，

223
00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.986
that they can call on demand for any support.
他们可以随时打电话要求各种服务。

224
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.179
And people have called us for so many reasons.
他们打电话的原因各种各样。

225
00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.322
They've called because their pets are unwell,
比如宠物生病了，

226
00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:42.620
their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone,
DVD机坏了，或者忘记怎么用手机了，

227
00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:43.493
or maybe they are coming out of hospital
或者从医院出来，

228
00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:45.650
and they want someone to be there.
希望有人能接他们。

229
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.450
And Circle also offers a rich social calendar --
“圈子”还安排了丰富的社会活动，

230
00:10:49.444 --> 00:10:53.559
knitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning -- you name it.
学编织，玩飞镖，参观博物馆， 乘热气球，多种多样。

231
00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:58.470
But here's the interesting thing, the really deep change:
但有意思的是，一个很大的变化产生了：

232
00:10:58.494 --> 00:11:01.705
over time, the friendships that have formed
随着时间推移，他们之前形成了友谊，

233
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:04.283
have begun to replace the practical offer.
并且开始变得比那些实际的帮助更重要。

234
00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:06.417
So let me tell you about Belinda.
下面我要讲讲关于贝琳达的事。

235
00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:10.677
Belinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation,
贝琳达是“圈子”的会员， 她准备去医院做一个髋骨手术，

236
00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:14.685
so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit.
于是她给本地的“圈子”打了个电话， 说自己有一段时间不会参加活动。

237
00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:18.509
And Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, "How can I help?"
达蒙，是当地“圈子”的负责人， 他回电话问，“需要帮助吗？”

238
00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:20.444
And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine --
贝琳达说，“哦，不用了，我没事

239
00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:23.261
Jocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony's doing the gardening,
乔斯琳帮我买东西，托尼帮我照顾花园，

240
00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:25.982
Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat."
梅丽莎和乔会过来帮我做饭，陪我聊天。”

241
00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:29.013
So five Circle members had organized themselves
五名“圈子”的成员分工合作，

242
00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:30.941
to take care of Belinda.
照顾贝琳达。

243
00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:35.289
And Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside,
贝琳达今年80岁了， 尽管她说自己内心才25，

244
00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:36.877
but she also says
她还说，

245
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:40.347
that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle.
初加入“圈子”的时候她感觉无助和低落。

246
00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:45.384
But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event
但社工们非常暖心地鼓励她 参加第一次活动时，

247
00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:48.608
led to a process where natural friendships formed,
慢慢让他们成为了朋友，

248
00:11:48.632 --> 00:11:52.953
friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services.
跟昂贵的服务相比， 友谊成为了更重要的需求。

249
00:11:52.977 --> 00:11:55.954
It's relationships that are making the difference.
正是人际关系带来了这一改变。

250
00:11:57.392 --> 00:12:00.300
So I think that three factors have converged
因此我觉得，为什么我们如此重视人际关系

251
00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:03.316
that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center
在解决社会问题中发挥的核心作用？

252
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.185
of how we solve social problems today.
原因有三点。

253
00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:08.272
Firstly, the nature of the problems --
首先，社会问题的本质

254
00:12:08.296 --> 00:12:10.951
they've changed, and they require different solutions.
发生了改变，因此需要不同的解决方式。

255
00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:15.465
Secondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual.
其次是支出，就像做普通生意一样， 经费越多人手越多。

256
00:12:15.489 --> 00:12:17.224
And thirdly, technology.
第三点就是科技。

257
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:20.349
I've talked about the first two factors.
前两个原因我刚才已经讲过了。

258
00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:23.321
It's technology that enables these approaches to scale
正是科技扩大了我们的规模，

259
00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:26.299
and potentially now support thousands of people.
让我们能服务数以千计的人。

260
00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:28.890
So the technology we've used is really simple,
其实我们使用的技术非常简单，

261
00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:32.367
it's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones.
无非就是数据库，手机这些有效的工具。

262
00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:35.127
Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it,
“圈子”就是依靠一个简单的支持系统，

263
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:39.011
enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand.
让一支小规模的本地团队 能服务多达一千名会员。

264
00:12:39.035 --> 00:12:41.808
And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization
大家可以将其与70年代的“邻里互助组织”

265
00:12:41.832 --> 00:12:42.989
of the 1970s,
进行比较，

266
00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:44.270
when this kind of scale just wasn't possible,
当时要做到如此大的规模根本不可能，

267
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:49.356
neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide.
服务质量和持续性 也远不如科技发达的今天。

268
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.569
So it's relationships underpinned by technology
因此，正是有了科技的支持

269
00:12:52.593 --> 00:12:55.506
that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads.
贝弗里奇模式才能得以转变。

270
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.176
The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources,
贝弗里奇模式中，福利机构的资源有限，

271
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.641
anonymously managing access.
并通过匿名方式进行管理。

272
00:13:01.665 --> 00:13:03.285
In my work at the front line,
我在福利工作第一线的时候，

273
00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:06.995
I've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource
不止一次见到高达80%的资源

274
00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:09.054
is spent keeping people out.
用来将人们拒之门外。

275
00:13:09.078 --> 00:13:10.768
So professionals have to administer

276
00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:13.186
these increasingly complex forms of administration

277
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.552

278
00:13:16.576 --> 00:13:18.303
or managing the queue.
或者需要排很久的队。

279
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.086
And Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed,

280
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.475
inverts this logic.
扭转了局面。

281
00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:28.492
What it says is, the more people, the more relationships,
有句话总结得好，参加的人越多， 人际关系越融洽，

282
00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.572
the stronger the solution.

283
00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:33.916
So I want to tell you my third and final story,

284
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.899
which is about unemployment.

285
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.886
In Britain, as in most places in the world,

our welfare states were primarily designed

But here, too, the systems are failing.

291
00:13:51.412 --> 00:13:52.784
And so the response has been

292
00:13:52.808 --> 00:13:56.345
to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional --

the very opposite of relational.

296
00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:10.649
But guess how most people find work today?

Through word of mouth.

it's friends that recommend you for a job,

302
00:14:26.623 --> 00:14:28.948
Maybe some of you here this evening are thinking,

303
00:14:28.972 --> 00:14:30.833
"But I found my job through an advert,"
“我就是通过招聘广告找到的工作呀。”

304

and then encouraged you to apply.

306
00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:37.127

people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network

are those who are most isolated from it.

309
00:14:43.177 --> 00:14:44.452
So knowing this,

310
00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:47.498
and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems,

we designed something new with relationships at its heart.

We designed a service that encourages people to meet up,

and try new opportunities.

316

And, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems

317
00:15:06.123 --> 00:15:07.795
with the old transactional models,
同旧的模式进行比较，

318
00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:10.120
but it looks like, with our first 1,000 members,

319
00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:13.035
we outperformed existing services by a factor of three,

at a fraction of the cost.

And here, too, we've used technology,

but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do.

We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other,

and people starting to see themselves,

within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions.

And human relationships were already withering.

But unfortunately, this third report was much less read

than Beveridge's earlier work.
