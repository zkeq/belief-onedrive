they frantically text their friends

regardless of where they end up at the end of high school,

if they don't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers

they won't have a future we can brag about

to our friends and with stickers on the backs of our cars.

Yeah.

110
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.980
(Applause)
（掌声）

111
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.276
But if you look at what we've done,
但如果你看看这件事的后果，

112
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.836
if you have the courage to really look at it,

113
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.836
you'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes

114
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.556
from grades and scores,
他们的价值来自于成绩和分数，

115
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.476
but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds
更是在他们正在成长的意识里，

116
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.076
all the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich,"
就像我们自己的电影《傀儡人生》一样，

117
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.036
we send our children the message:

“嘿，孩子，没有我你什么都干不成。”

119
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.956
And so with our overhelp,

120
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.516
our overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding,
过度保护，过度指导和过度关怀，

121
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.556
we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy,

122
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.276
which is a really fundamental tenet of the human psyche,
自我能效是人类心智的重要准则，

123
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.916
far more important than that self-esteem they get
远比通过父母赞美建立起的自尊

124
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.340
every time we applaud.
更重要。

125
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.116
Self-efficacy is built when one sees that one's own actions lead to outcomes,
自我能效是当一个人看到自己的行动 能产生成果而建立起来的，

126
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.356
not --
而不是…

127
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.596
There you go.
你们先吧。

128
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.460
(Applause)
（掌声）

129
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.196
Not one's parents' actions on one's behalf,
而不是父母代表他们做出的行动，

130
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.996
but when one's own actions lead to outcomes.
是他们自己的行动能产生结果。

131
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.516
So simply put,
简而言之，

132
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.876
if our children are to develop self-efficacy, and they must,
如果我们的孩子要建立， 他们也必须建立自我能效，

133
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.756
then they have to do a whole lot more of the thinking, planning, deciding,
就需要更多的为他们自己的人生

134
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.356
doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,
做更多思考、规划、决定、

135
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.516
dreaming and experiencing of life

136

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.596

138
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.956
every kid is hard-working and motivated
每个孩子都很努力，都很积极，

139
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.156
and doesn't need a parent's involvement or interest in their lives,
都不需要对他们的人生有干涉和关心，

140
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.060
and we should just back off and let go?
我们应该退后，任其发展呢？

141
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.076
Hell no.
当然不是。

142
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.316
(Laughter)
（笑声）

143
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.036
That is not what I'm saying.
这不是我想说的。

144
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.676
What I'm saying is, when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards

as the purpose of childhood,
