I used to think

the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness.

Everyone said the path to happiness was success,

4
00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:24.406
so I searched for that ideal job,

5
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.461

00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:31.816
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.444
I felt anxious and adrift.

8
00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:39.324
And I wasn't alone; my friends -- they struggled with this, too.
这种情况不止发生在我身上 ， 我身边的朋友也一样。

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.809
Eventually, I decided to go to graduate school for positive psychology

10
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.053
to learn what truly makes people happy.

11
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.447
But what I discovered there changed my life.

12
00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:56.882
The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.

13
00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:00.044
And what really struck me was this:

14
00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:03.665
the suicide rate has been rising around the world,
全球的自杀率都在上升，

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.780
and it recently reached a 30-year high in America.

Even though life is getting objectively better

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.050
by nearly every conceivable standard,

more people feel hopeless,

20
00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.847
There's an emptiness gnawing away at people,

21
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.141
and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it.
空虚感正侵蚀着我们的内心。

22
00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:27.065
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:
迟早，我们都会疑惑：

23
00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:29.836
Is this all there is?
人生就是如此了吗？

24
00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:34.193
And according to the research, what predicts this despair

25
00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:36.044
is not a lack of happiness.
并不是生活缺乏快乐。

26
00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:37.910
It's a lack of something else,
而是因为生命缺少了

27
00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:41.575
a lack of having meaning in life.
人生的意义。

28
00:01:42.782 --> 00:01:45.175
But that raised some questions for me.
因此我思索

29
00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:48.274
Is there more to life than being happy?
人生除了快乐还有什么 更重要的事情？

30
00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.459
And what's the difference between being happy
以及快乐的人生与

31
00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:53.374

Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease,

33
00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:01.212
feeling good in the moment.

34
00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:03.576
Meaning, though, is deeper.

35
00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:06.662
The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says
著名的心理学家马丁·赛里格曼认为

36
00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:11.333
meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself
意义来源于归属和献身 高于自我的事物

37
00:02:11.357 --> 00:02:14.040
and from developing the best within you.
还有塑造最好的自己。

38
00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.032
Our culture is obsessed with happiness,
我们的文化醉心于寻求快乐，

39
00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:22.163
but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path.
但我意识到寻求意义更 能让你有满足感。

40
00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:25.116
And the studies show that people who have meaning in life,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.550
they're more resilient,
让人更变得更坚毅，

42
00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:29.131
they do better in school and at work,
在学业和事业上更成功，

43
00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:30.762
and they even live longer.
寿命也更长。

44
00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:33.826
So this all made me wonder:
这一切都让我思考：

45
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.324
How can we each live more meaningfully?
如何才能让人生更有意义？

46
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.478
To find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people

47
00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.403
and reading through thousands of pages of psychology,

48
00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:46.528
neuroscience and philosophy.

49
00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:48.975
Bringing it all together,
经过所有这些努力，

50
00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:54.340
I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.
我发现构成有意义的人生 需要四大支柱。

51
00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.798
And we can each create lives of meaning

52
00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:00.171
by building some or all of these pillars in our lives.
我们所有人都能拥有 有意义的人生。

53
00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.436
The first pillar is belonging.
第一大支柱便是：归属感。

54
00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:06.505
Belonging comes from being in relationships
归属感来源于人际关系中

55
00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.234
where you're valued for who you are intrinsically
你的内在价值在哪里，

56
00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:11.371
and where you value others as well.
以及同时你对别人的价值认可。

57
00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:16.728
But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging;
但某些组织和人际关系 给予廉价的归属感；

58
00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:18.645
you're valued for what you believe,
你的价值在于你的信仰，

59
00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:19.915
for who you hate,
在于你讨厌谁，

not for who you are.

61
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.023
True belonging springs from love.
真正的归属感来源于爱。

62
00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:28.032
It lives in moments among individuals,
它时时刻刻都萦绕在你身边，

63
00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:31.901
and it's a choice -- you can choose to cultivate belonging with others.
这是个选择——你可以选择 跟谁培养归属感。

64
00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:34.088
Here's an example.
举一个例子。

65
00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:37.667
Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper
我的朋友乔纳森每天都在 纽约同一家

66
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.909
from the same street vendor in New York.
小店里买报纸。

67
00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:42.602
They don't just conduct a transaction, though.
他和店主不止是商业交易。

68
00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.309
They take a moment to slow down, talk,

69
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.239
and treat each other like humans.
很亲切地对待对方。

70
00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:51.252
But one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change,
有一次乔纳森没有零钱，

71
00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:52.496
and the vendor said,
店主就说，

72
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.040
"Don't worry about it."

But Jonathan insisted on paying,

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.587

75
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.072
to make change.

76
00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:04.435
But when he gave the money to the vendor,

77
00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.981
the vendor drew back.

78
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.918
He was hurt.

79
00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:10.384
He was trying to do something kind,

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:12.655
but Jonathan had rejected him.
但乔纳森拒绝了他的好意。

81
00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:18.084
I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it.
我想我们都会在无意中伤害他人。

82
00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:19.306
I do.
我也如此。

83
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.393
I'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them.
我有时撞见我认识的人却没打招呼。

84
00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:25.064
I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me.
有时候我在别人和我说话时看手机。

85
00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.427
These acts devalue others.

86
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:30.204
They make them feel invisible and unworthy.
让他们觉得自己没有存在感和价值。

87
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.702
But when you lead with love, you create a bond
但当你用爱联系他人，你建立的纽带

88
00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:35.398
that lifts each of you up.
就激励了你们双方。

89
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.478
For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning,
对很多人来说，归属感是人生意义的 最重要来源，

90
00:04:40.502 --> 00:04:42.500
those bonds to family and friends.
那些与家人和朋友的纽带。

91
00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:47.001
For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose.
而对其他人而言，意义的关键来源 的第二大支柱是：人生目的。

92
00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:50.579
Now, finding your purpose is not the same thing
找到人生目的

93
00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:52.851
as finding that job that makes you happy.
和找到让你快乐的工作不一样。

94
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.799
Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.
人生目的并不在于你所得 而在于你所给。

95
00:04:56.823 --> 00:05:01.311
A hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people.
一位医院的管理员说他的人生目的 就是治愈病患。

96
00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.046
Many parents tell me,
很多家长会说人生目的是

97
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.006
"My purpose is raising my children."
“养育自己的孩子”。

98
00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:09.391
The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.
人生目的意味着尽自己的能力去 帮助他人。

99
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:13.709
Of course, for many of us, that happens through work.
当然对很多人来说，我们通过工作 来实现人生目的。

100
00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:16.712
That's how we contribute and feel needed.
这是我们的贡献，也是感到被需要的方式。

101
00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:20.596
But that also means that issues like disengagement at work,
但这也同时说明工作中的疏离问题，

102
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.033
unemployment,
失业，

103
00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:24.284
low labor force participation --

104
00:05:24.308 --> 00:05:27.999
these aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too.

105
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.854
Without something worthwhile to do,
没有值得做的事情，

106
00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:32.179
people flounder.
人们就会陷入困境。

107
00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:35.929
Of course, you don't have to find purpose at work,
当然不一定非得做份 满足人生目的工作，

108
00:05:35.953 --> 00:05:38.682
but purpose gives you something to live for,
但目的给了你活着的意义，

109
00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.786
some "why" that drives you forward.
这些“为什么”能让你坚持走下去。

110
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.267
The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself,
第三大支柱同样跟超越自我有关。

111
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.133
but in a completely different way:
但方式完全不一样

112
00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:49.744
transcendence.
那就是超验。

113
00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:52.145
Transcendent states are those rare moments

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.581
when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life,
那一刻你忘却了日常中的繁琐喧嚣，

115
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.310
your sense of self fades away,
进入忘我的状态，

116
00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:00.108
and you feel connected to a higher reality.
你感到自己与更高 的真实世界相连。

117
00:06:01.034 --> 00:06:04.724
For one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art.
我聊过的某个人说他欣赏艺术时 便会进入超验状态。

118
00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:07.278
For another person, it was at church.
另一个说进入教堂时会如此。

119
00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:10.856
For me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing.
对我来说，作为作家， 这会发生在我写作时。

120
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.950
Sometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place.
有时候我太投入了，以致忘记时间流逝， 忘记身处何处。

121
00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:19.723
These transcendent experiences can change you.
这些超验的体验能真的改变你。

122
00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:24.271
One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees

But afterwards they felt less self-centered,

128
00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:40.917
Now, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found,
第四个构成意义的支柱，

129
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:42.696
tends to surprise people.
让人意想不到。

130
00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:45.920
The fourth pillar is storytelling,
那就是讲故事。

131
00:06:45.944 --> 00:06:48.809
the story you tell yourself about yourself.
向自己讲述自己的故事。

132
00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:53.580
Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.
从生活事件中提炼出故事 让你更加清晰。

133
00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:56.640
It helps you understand how you became you.

134
00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:00.585
But we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories
人们总是忽视我们是故事的作者，

135
00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:02.772
and can change the way we're telling them.
可以改变讲故事的方式。

136
00:07:02.796 --> 00:07:05.287
Your life isn't just a list of events.
人生不只是一连串事件。

137
00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:08.527
You can edit, interpret and retell your story,
虽然发生的事情不可改变，

138
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:10.771
even as you're constrained by the facts.
但你可以编辑、解释和复述你的故事。

139
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:16.129
I met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football.
我曾遇到一个叫艾马卡的年轻人 他因打橄榄球而受伤瘫痪了。

140

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:21.928
"My life was great playing football,

142
00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:24.076
but now look at me."

143
00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:28.114
People who tell stories like this --

144
00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:30.662
"My life was good. Now it's bad." --

145
00:07:30.686 --> 00:07:33.508
tend to be more anxious and depressed.
这样只会让人更焦躁和抑郁。
