00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:15.940
So, this happy pic of me was taken in 1999.
我这张快乐的照片拍摄于1999年。

2
00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:18.054
I was a senior in college,
当年我大四，

3
00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:20.010
and it was right after a dance practice.
拍摄于舞蹈练习之后。

4
00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:21.552
I was really, really happy.
我当时非常开心。

5
00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:26.034
And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later.
我清楚地记得在一周半之后，

6
00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.277
I was sitting in the back of my used minivan

7
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.064
in a campus parking lot,
在校园停车场，

8
00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:32.239
when I decided

9
00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:34.042
I was going to commit suicide.
我要自杀。

10
00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:39.833
I went from deciding to full-blown planning very quickly.
我很快下定决心并有了周全的计划。

11
00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:43.383
And I came this close to the edge of the precipice.
然而我悬崖勒马。

12
00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:45.044
It's the closest I've ever come.
死亡近在咫尺。

13
00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:48.481
And the only reason I took my finger off the trigger
我未扣动扳机的唯一原因

14
00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.928
was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.
是一些幸运的巧合。

15
00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.190
And after the fact,
在此之后，

16
00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:56.336
that's what scared me the most: the element of chance.
我意识到真正让我恐惧的是机会。

17
00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:00.254
So I became very methodical about testing different ways
因此我开始井然有序地尝试不同方式

18
00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:02.408
that I could manage my ups and downs,
来控制我生活的跌宕起伏，

19
00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:06.301
which has proven to be a good investment. (Laughs)
现在看来这是个不错的投资。

20
00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:05.121
Many normal people might have, say, six to 10 major depressive episodes
（笑声）

21
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.981
in their lives.
大部分普通人一生中会有 6-10 次

22
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:12.028
I have bipolar depression. It runs in my family.
较为严重的抑郁阶段。

23
00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:14.378
I've had 50-plus at this point,
我有躁郁症，是我家的遗传病。

24
00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:17.427
and I've learned a lot.
我大概已经有 50 多次

25
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.972
I've had a lot of at-bats,
我学到了很多。

26
00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:21.568
many rounds in the ring with darkness,
我内心有很多蝙蝠，

27
00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:23.933
taking good notes.
它们在黑暗中轮回着飞行，

28
00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:25.417
So I thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success
寻找着出口。

29
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:29.116
or highlight reel,
因此我认为与其给大家任何成功心灵鸡汤

30
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.293
I would share my recipe for avoiding self-destruction,
或者经典语录，

31
00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:34.296
and certainly self-paralysis.
我会分享如何避免自我毁灭的秘诀，

32
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.058
And the tool I've found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net
与避免自我麻痹的秘方。

33
00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.035
for emotional free fall
我所找到的并被证实为最可靠安全的

34
00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:43.495
is actually the same tool
情绪安全网

35
00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.386
that has helped me to make my best business decisions.
也正是

36
00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:48.697
But that is secondary.
我用来做出最佳商业决定的工具。

37
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.041
And it is ... stoicism.
但是这是次要的。

38
00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:53.670
That sounds boring.
它就是斯多葛学派。

39
00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:55.218
(Laughter)
听起来很无聊。

40
00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:56.305
You might think of Spock,
（笑声）

41
00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.945
or it might conjure and image like this --
你也许会想到斯波克，

42
00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:01.984
(Laughter)
或者会幻想到这样的画面：

43
00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:01.984
a cow standing in the rain.
（笑声）

44
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:03.985
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.
一头站在雨中的牛。

45
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.330
It's just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way.
它不悲伤，也并非快乐。

46
00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:11.154
You might not think of the ultimate competitor, say, Bill Belichick,
它不过是一个逆来顺受的 无动于衷的生物。

47
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.115
head coach of the New England Patriots,
你也许不会想到与其相反的人， 比如比尔·贝利奇克，

48
00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.395
who has the all-time NFL record for Super Bowl titles.
新英格兰爱国者队主教练，

49
00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.468
And stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the NFL ranks
他有 NFL 历史上最多的超级碗冠军。

50
00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:26.847
as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years.
斯多葛学派在 NFL 排行榜榜首中像野火一样蔓延，

51
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:30.028
You might not think of the Founding Fathers --
作为近几年来训练心智的手段。

52
00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.261
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington
你也许想不到我们国家的奠基人，

53
00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:37.423
to name but three students of stoicism.
托马斯·杰斐逊、约翰·亚当斯、 乔治·华盛顿

54
00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:40.239
George Washington actually had a play about a Stoic --
他们都是斯多葛学派的信奉者。

55
00:02:40.263 --> 00:02:44.361
this was "Cato, a Tragedy" --
事实上，乔治·华盛顿 有一部有关于斯多葛学派的戏剧

56
00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:46.368
performed for his troops at Valley Forge to keep them motivated.
这就《卡托，一个悲剧》

57
00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:49.579
So why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy?
曾鼓励他部队在福吉谷时的军心。

58
00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:54.246
This seems very academic.
为什么人们会如此在乎一个古老的哲学？

59
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.956
I would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently,
这似乎非常学术。

60
00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:03.315
as an operating system for thriving in high-stress environments,
我建议从另一个角度看待斯多葛学派，

61
00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:03.315
for making better decisions.
这是一个在高压环境中成功的机制，

62
00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.821
And it all started here,
做出更好的选择。

63
00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.969
kind of,
所有的一切

64
00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:09.156
on a porch.
似乎都源于

65
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.626
So around 300 BC in Athens,
一个门廊。

66
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.907
someone named Zeno of Citium taught many lectures
在公元前300年左右的雅典，

67
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.804
walking around a painted porch, a "stoa."

68
00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:19.580
That later became "stoicism."

69
00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:21.336
And in the Greco-Roman world,
这之后就成为“斯多葛学派”。

70
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.617
people used stoicism as a comprehensive system
而在希腊罗马世界，

71
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.403
for doing many, many things.
人们把斯多葛学派作为一个全面的系统

72
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:28.837
But for our purposes, chief among them was training yourself
能解决很多事情。

73
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.549
to separate what you can control from what you cannot control,
于我们而言， 最主要的目的是训练我们自己

74
00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:37.020
and then doing exercises to focus exclusively
将可控和不可控的事情分开，

75
00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:40.102
on the former.
然后训练如何专注于于前者。

76
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:43.679
This decreases emotional reactivity,
这将降低情绪的反应力，

77
00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:45.251
which can be a superpower.
这将成为一种超能力。

78
00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:48.844
Conversely, let's say you're a quarterback.

You miss a pass. You get furious with yourself.

80
00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:52.590
That could cost you a game.
这会让你输掉比赛。

81

that could cost you the employee.

86
00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:10.914
unabated, that could cost you your life.

87
00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.197
So the stakes are very, very high.

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:17.215
And there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there.
工具箱里有很多工具能帮到你。

89
00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.076
I'm going to focus on one that completely changed my life in 2004.
我会着重分享一个在2004年 完全改变我人生的工具。

90
00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:24.439
It found me then because of two things:

91
00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:29.828
a very close friend, young guy, my age, died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,
一个与我年龄相仿的男性挚友 意外死于胰腺癌，

之后是我以为是 真命天女的女朋友离我而去。

出于对我健康的关心， 她把这个放在我的桌上，

100
00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:53.085
because at the time, I was working on my first real business.
因为当时我正投入于我的第一个事业。

I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers.

might defining your fears be more important than defining your goals?
也许会让你看清恐惧而不是目标？

"We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."
“折磨我們的往往是想像， 而不是真實”
