1
00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:15.439
To be honest, by personality,
说实话，从性格上来讲，

2
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.056
I'm just not much of a crier.
我并不是一个容易流泪的人。

3
00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:22.416
But I think in my career that's been a good thing.
但考虑到我的职业， 能有这个性格是件好事。

4
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.450
I'm a civil rights lawyer,
我是一名民权律师，

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.454
and I've seen some  horrible things in the world.
我见过一些发生在 全球各地的可怕的事情。

6
00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:32.664
I began my career working  police abuse cases in the United States.
我的第一份职业是在美国 处理警察滥用职权的案子。

7
00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:36.138
And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda
后来，1994年，我被派往卢旺达，

8
00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:41.068
to be the director of the U.N.'s  genocide investigation.
领导联合国种族灭绝调查组。

9
00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:45.467
It turns out that tears  just aren't much help
我发现，当你调查 种族灭绝的惨案时，

10
00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.996
when you're trying  to investigate a genocide.
泪水派不上多大用场。

11
00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:53.857
The things I had to see,  and feel and touch
那些我不得不面对的事实， 那些令我感触深刻的故事，

12
00:00:53.857 --> 00:00:56.684
were pretty unspeakable.
都难以名状。

13
00:00:57.354 --> 00:01:00.711
What I can tell you is this:
我可以明确告诉你们的是：

14
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:02.808
that the Rwandan genocide
卢旺达种族灭绝是

15
00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:08.481
was one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion.
缺乏同情导致的 全世界最惨的惨案之一。

16
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:12.940
That word, compassion, actually  comes from two Latin words:
"同情"这个词 来源于两个拉丁词汇：

17
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.462
cum passio, which simply mean  "to suffer with."
cum和passio， 其含义是"同甘苦"。

18
00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:22.024
And the things that I saw and experienced
目睹卢旺达的惨案，

19
00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:24.610
in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering,
我感受到了那里的 人们所承受的苦难，

20
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.949
it did, in moments, move me to tears.
这让我落下泪水。

21
00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:30.675
But I just wish that I,  and the rest of the world,
我多么希望， 我，以及整个世界，

22
00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:33.190
had been moved earlier.
可以在一切发生前就投以同情。

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.854
And not just to tears,
不单单是落下同情的泪水，

24
00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:38.654
but to actually stop the genocide.
更要切实阻止这场惨案。

25
00:01:38.654 --> 00:01:41.112
Now by contrast, I've also been involved
与之对比，我也经历了

26
00:01:41.112 --> 00:01:46.945
with one of the world's greatest successes of compassion.
同情带来的最美好的硕果之一。

27
00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:49.891
And that's the fight against  global poverty.
这就是全世界范围内 拯救贫困的运动。

28
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.674
It's a cause that probably has involved all of us here.
这场运动或许 跟在座的每个人都相关。

29
00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:54.672
I don't know if your first introduction
我不知道是什么让 你们初次了解到世界贫困问题，

30
00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:58.037
might have been choruses of "We Are the World,"
是"天下一家"这一合唱曲，

31
00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:02.100
or maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door,
还是你们家冰箱门上贴着的 受到救济的儿童的照片，

32
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.187
or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water.
还是你把过生日的钱拿去 捐给了水质净化项目？

33
00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:09.401
I don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was
我不记得是什么让我 第一次了解到贫困问题，

34
00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:12.965
but I do remember the most jarring.

35
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.127
It was when I met Venus --

she's a mom from Zambia.

38
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:24.842
When I met her, she had walked about 12 miles

39
00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:27.515
in the only garments she owned,

40
00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:31.777
to come to the capital city and to share her story.

41
00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:35.392
She sat down with me for hours,
她坐着跟我聊了好几个小时，

42
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:39.917
just ushered me in to  the world of poverty.
让我深刻体会到了 贫穷世界究竟是何等模样。

43
00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:43.058
She described what it was like  when the coals on the cooking fire
她向我描述着一幅幅贫困的画面：

44
00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:46.787
finally just went completely cold.

45

When that last drop  of cooking oil finally ran out.

46
00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.405
When the last of the food,  despite her best efforts,

47
00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:56.513
ran out.
最后一口食物。

48
00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.916
She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,
她不得不眼睁睁地 看着小儿子 Peter

49
00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:03.698
suffer from malnutrition,
遭受营养不良的折磨，

50
00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:07.774
as his legs just slowly bowed  into uselessness.
他的双腿渐渐萎缩， 丧失了行走的能力。

51
00:03:07.774 --> 00:03:11.122
As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.

52
00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:15.300
And then as Peter finally grew cold.
直到最后，他的身子变冰冷了。

53
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.631
For over 50 years, stories like this have been moving us to compassion.

54
00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:26.481
We whose kids have plenty to eat.

55
00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:29.150
And we're moved not only  to care about global poverty,

56
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.840
but to actually try to do our part  to stop the suffering.
还尽了自己的一份力， 让贫困的人不再受苦受难。

57
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.313
Now there's plenty of room for critique  that we haven't done enough,
有很多方面我们做的还不够，

58
00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:41.535
and what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough,
我们做的很多事情效果还不够显著，

59
00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:44.665
but the truth is this:
但事实是：

60
00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:48.216
The fight against global poverty is probably the broadest,
抗击世界贫困的运动很可能是

61
00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:53.351
longest running manifestation of the  human phenomenon of compassion

in the history of our species.

63
00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:00.142
And so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight
我会给你们分享一些我的见解，

64
00:04:00.142 --> 00:04:04.435
that might forever change the way you think about that struggle.
或许会永远改变大家 对这场运动的认识。

65
00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:07.258
But first, let me begin with what you probably already know.
但首先，我来谈一下你们大多 已经知道的一些事实。

66
00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:10.740
Thirty-five years ago, when I would have been graduating from high school,
35年前，我快要从高中毕业的时候，

67
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.117
they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty.
有数据表明每天有 四万个儿童死于饥饿。

68
00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:21.489
That number, today, is now  down to 17,000.
今天，这个数字下降到一万七千。

69
00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.495
Way too many, of course,
当然，还是很多，

70
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.172
but it does mean that every year,
但这确实表明，

71
00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:31.490
there's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty.

73
00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:36.050
who are living in extreme poverty,

74
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.387
which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day,

75
00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:42.999
that has fallen from 50 percent,
已经从世界人口的50%

76
00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.233
to only 15 percent.

77
00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:48.673
This is massive progress,

and this exceeds everybody's  expectations about what is possible.
超出了所有人的预期。

79
00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:56.943
And I think you and I,
我认为我们所有人，

80
00:04:56.943 --> 00:05:01.219
I think, honestly, that we can  feel proud and encouraged
说实话， 我们应当为此而感到自豪，

81
00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.104
to see the way that compassion  actually has the power
能够见证同情迸发出的力量

82
00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:10.296
to succeed in stopping  the suffering of millions.
如何解救了数以百万计的人们。

83
00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:14.672
But here's the part that you  might not hear very much about.
但后面这个数据 你们可能没听说过。

84
00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:19.406
If you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day,
如果把贫困线稍稍上移， 设为一天2美金，

85
00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:22.405
it turns out that virtually  the same two billion people
你就会发现世界上仍然有20亿人

86
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:26.217
who were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school,

87
00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:28.098
are still stuck there,
我上高中时有这么多人，

88
00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.487
35 years later.
35年后的今天依然是。

89
00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:35.506
So why, why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty?
为什么呢？为什么有好几十亿人 深陷贫困的深渊？

90
00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:39.171
Well, let's think about Venus for a moment.
让我们再回到Venus的故事。

91
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:42.943
Now for decades, my wife and I have been moved by common compassion

92
00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.772
to sponsor kids, to fund microloans,

93
00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:49.291
to support generous levels of foreign aid.
慷慨地支持国外援救行动。

94
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.383
But until I had actually talked to Venus,
但直到我亲身跟Venus攀谈后，

95
00:05:52.383 --> 00:05:55.020
I would have had no idea that  none of those approaches
我才知道以前所做的一切 都没有切中要害，

96
00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.516
actually addressed why she had to watch her son die.
以致于她不得不眼睁睁地 看着她的孩子死去。

97
00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:06.063
"We were doing fine," Venus told me,
“本来我们过得挺好，” Venus告诉我，

98
00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:10.605
"until Brutus started to cause trouble."
”直到Brutus开始惹麻烦。“

99
00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:13.575
Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor  and "cause trouble"
Brutus是Venus的邻居， ”惹麻烦“是指

100
00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:17.101
is what happened the day after Venus' husband died,
Venus丈夫去世后的第二天，

101
00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:21.033
when Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house,

stole all their land, and robbed their market stall.

103
00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:31.162
You see, Venus was thrown  into destitution by violence.
是暴力让Venus陷入贫困。

104
00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:34.711
And then it occurred to me, of course,
这让我突然间意识到，

105
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:38.510
that none of my child sponsorships, none of the microloans,

106
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.372
none of the traditional  anti-poverty programs
传统的抗击贫困的运动，

107
00:06:42.372 --> 00:06:46.338
were going to stop Brutus,
都无法阻止Brutus，

108
00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:49.692
because they weren't meant to.
因为所做的一切都没切中要害。

109
00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:54.698
This became even more clear to me when I met Griselda.
当我遇到Griselda后， 我更加清晰地意识到这个问题。

110
00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:58.917

in Guatemala.

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:03.130
And one of the things we've learned over the years
根据我们过去的经验，

113
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.701
is that perhaps the most powerful thing
我们认为让Griselda和她的家庭

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:08.545
that Griselda and her family can do
走出贫困的最有效的办法，

115
00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:11.210
to get Griselda and her family  out of poverty

116
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.334
is to make sure that she goes to school.
Griselda能够完成学业。

117
00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:19.059
The experts call this the Girl Effect.

118
00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:23.141
But when we met Griselda,  she wasn't going to school.
但当我们遇到Griselda时， 她并没有上学。

119
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:26.698
In fact, she was rarely ever  leaving her home.

Days before we met her,

121
00:07:29.993 --> 00:07:32.638
while she was walking home from church with her family,

125
00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:46.025
See, Griselda had every opportunity to go to school,
所以，Griselda并不缺少上学的机会，

126
00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:49.446
it just wasn't safe for her to get there.
只是上学的路上太不安全了。

127
00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:52.286
And Griselda's not the only one.

128
00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:55.010
Around the world, poor women and girls

129
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.121
between the ages of 15 and 44,

00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:04.206
they are -- when victims of  the everyday violence

131
00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:07.692
of domestic abuse and sexual violence --

00:08:07.692 --> 00:08:12.504
those two forms of violence account for more death and disability
要超过因疟疾、交通事故、战争

133
00:08:12.504 --> 00:08:19.508
than malaria, than car accidents, than war combined.

The truth is, the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence.
真相是，全世界的穷人 都深陷暴力的牢笼。

135
00:08:27.895 --> 00:08:31.928
In South Asia, for instance, I could drive past this rice mill
比如说，在南亚， 我开车驶过一片稻田，

136

and see this man hoisting  these 100-pound sacks

of rice upon his thin back.

139
00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.169
that he was actually a slave,
他原来是一个奴隶，

140
00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.558
held by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school.
在我上着高中时， 他就被迫碾米作坊劳作。

141
00:08:46.648 --> 00:08:50.059
Decades of anti-poverty programs right in his community
数十年来，他所在社区的 抗击贫困的运动

142
00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:54.141
were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves
都没能解救他， 也没能解救作坊中其他

143
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.777
from the beatings and the rapes and the torture
遭受殴打、强暴、酷刑的

144
00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:01.472
of violence inside the rice mill.
百余名奴隶。

145
00:09:01.472 --> 00:09:05.852
In fact, half a century of  anti-poverty programs
事实上，相对于 人类历史上其他任何时刻，

146
00:09:05.852 --> 00:09:09.526
have left more poor people in slavery
近半世纪以来的抗击贫困的运动，

147
00:09:09.526 --> 00:09:12.891
than in any other time in human history.
让人类历史上沦为奴隶的人数达到了顶峰。

148
00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:18.870
Experts tell us that there's about 35 million people in slavery today.
专家告诉我们， 世界上目前大概有三千五百万奴隶。

149
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.531
That's about the population  of the entire nation of Canada,
这大概相当于加拿大 整个国家人口的数量，

150
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:25.999
where we're sitting today.
这就是目前的状况。

151
00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:29.303
This is why, over time, I have come to call this epidemic of violence
这就是为什么， 我将这遍布的暴力称之为

152
00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:31.592
the Locust Effect.
“蝗虫效应”。

153
00:09:31.592 --> 00:09:34.603
Because in the lives of the poor, it just descends like a plague
因为，穷人们就像 遭受了一场瘟疫般，

154
00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:37.391
and it destroys everything.
家庭支离破碎，生活惨不忍睹。

155
00:09:37.391 --> 00:09:41.774
In fact, now when you survey very, very poor communities,
事实上，如今当你跟 那些极度贫困的社区居民交流时，

156
00:09:41.774 --> 00:09:45.858
residents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence.
他们会告诉你 他们最大的恐惧，就是暴力。

157
00:09:45.858 --> 00:09:48.427
But notice the violence that they fear
注意，他们恐惧的暴力

158
00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:51.605
is not the violence of  genocide or the wars,
不是种族灭绝或战争，

159
00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.960
it's everyday violence.
而是日常暴力。

160
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.173
So for me, as a lawyer, of course, my first reaction was to think,
因此，对我而言，作为一个律师， 我的第一个反应理所当然是，

161
00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:59.487
well, of course we've got to change all the laws.
我们必须要修正法律。

162
00:09:59.487 --> 00:10:02.987
We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal.
我们必须以法律作为武器 严惩暴力行为。

163
00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:06.722
But then I found out, it already is.
但我随即发现， 相关法律条文已经有了。

164
00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:09.562
The problem is not that  the poor don't get laws,
问题不在于 没有保护穷人的法律条文，

165
00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:13.262
it's that they don't get law enforcement.
而在于法律得不到实施。

166
00:10:14.362 --> 00:10:16.005
In the developing world,
在发展中国家，

167
00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:19.070
basic law enforcement systems are so broken
践行法律的机构系统腐朽不堪，

168
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.236
that recently the U.N. issued  a report that found
联合国最近的报告显示，

169
00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:27.840
that "most poor people live outside the protection of the law."
”绝大多数穷人 得不到法律保障。“

170
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.232
Now honestly, you and I have  just about no idea
说实话，你我都想象不到，

171
00:10:30.232 --> 00:10:31.829
of what that would mean
没有法律保障意味着什么，

172
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:35.508
because we have no  first-hand experience of it.
因为我们都没有切身体会过。

173
00:10:35.508 --> 00:10:38.585
Functioning law enforcement for us  is just a total assumption.
在我们心目中， 法律的践行完全是理所当然的，

174
00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:42.957
In fact, nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers:
事实上，给我们吃定心丸的 就是那三个数字：

175
00:10:42.957 --> 00:10:45.418
9-1-1,
911，

176
00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:48.585
which, of course, is the number for the emergency police operator
不用说，这就是加拿大和美国

177
00:10:48.585 --> 00:10:51.886
here in Canada and in the United States,
通用的紧急报警号码，

178
00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:55.967
where the average response time  to a police 911 emergency call
拨打911的警方平均响应时间

179
00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:57.630
is about 10 minutes.
大概是10分钟。

180
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.815
So we take this just  completely for granted.
我们认为这完全是理所当然的。

181
00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:05.332
But what if there was no  law enforcement to protect you?
但是，如果没有法律保护你， 会发生什么？

182
00:11:06.402 --> 00:11:11.024
A woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like.
俄勒冈州的一名女子 最近就有过这样的切身经历。

183
00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:15.365
She was home alone in her  dark house on a Saturday night,
在一个周六的夜晚， 她独自呆在灯光昏暗的家中，

184
00:11:15.365 --> 00:11:18.330
when a man started to tear  his way into her home.
此时一名男子试图撬门而入。

185
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.287
This was her worst nightmare,

186
00:11:20.287 --> 00:11:24.895
because this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault
因为就在两周前， 这个男子袭击了她，

187
00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:27.013
just two weeks before.
让她受伤住进了医院。

188
00:11:27.013 --> 00:11:30.371
So terrified, she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do:
惊慌失措中，她拿起电话， 像所有人都会做的那样：

189
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:33.016
She calls 911 --
她拨打了911——

190
00:11:33.016 --> 00:11:37.848
but only to learn that because  of budget cuts in her county,

191
00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:41.217
law enforcement wasn't available  on the weekends.

can you ask him to go away?

Or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything?
或者，你知道他是不是 喝醉了之类的吗？

198
00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:57.235
Woman: I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you.
女子：我已经跟他说不要进来了。 我已经告诉他我拨911了。

199
00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:59.908
He's broken in before, busted down my door, assaulted me.
以前他就闯入过我家，侵犯了我。

200

Woman: Um, yeah, so ...

Woman: No, I can't, because he's blocking pretty much my only way out.
女子：没有，没办法， 因为他堵在我唯一的出口。

204
00:12:08.642 --> 00:12:11.788
Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do  is give you some advice,
话务员：好吧，我唯一能做的 就是给你一些建议，

205
00:12:11.788 --> 00:12:14.504
and call the sheriff's office tomorrow.
明天我会报告给警官。

206
00:12:14.504 --> 00:12:19.316
Obviously, if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon
当然，如果他闯进来，还拿着武器，

207
00:12:19.316 --> 00:12:22.642
or is trying to cause you physical harm, that's a different story.
或试图给你造成身体伤害， 那就是另一回事了。

208
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:25.309
You know, the sheriff's office doesn't work up there.

209
00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:27.065
I don't have anybody to send."

was violently assaulted, choked and raped
被残暴地殴打，窒息，强奸，

212
00:12:38.147 --> 00:12:44.191
because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law.
这就是生活在法律保障之外的情形。

213
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:49.675
And this is where billions of our poorest live.
这就是数十亿穷人所生活的环境。

214
00:12:51.835 --> 00:12:54.263
What does that look like?
具体是什么样的呢？

215
00:12:54.263 --> 00:12:58.691
In Bolivia, for example, if a man  sexually assaults a poor child,
比如，在玻利维亚，如果一个男人 对一个穷人家的孩子性骚扰，

216
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:03.364
statistically, he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying

217
00:13:03.364 --> 00:13:06.762
than he is of ever going  to jail for that crime.

218
00:13:07.822 --> 00:13:12.507
In South Asia, if you  enslave a poor person,

you're at greater risk of being  struck by lightning

220
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.480
than ever being sent  to jail for that crime.

221
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.459
And so the epidemic of everyday  violence, it just rages on.
日常暴力如瘟疫般席卷着穷人的世界。

222
00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:27.558
And it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people

223
00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:31.135
out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.
所付出的一切努力化为泡影。

224
00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:33.637
Because the data just doesn't lie.
因为数据不会说谎。

225
00:13:33.637 --> 00:13:36.696
It turns out that you can give  all manner of goods and services

226
00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:37.849
to the poor,

227
00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:40.975
but if you don't restrain the hands  of the violent bullies

228
00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:42.810
from taking it all away,
这一切的暴徒，

229
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.169
you're going to be very disappointed in the long-term impact of your efforts.
你所付出的努力会让你失望透顶。

230
00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:51.480
So you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement
因此，你们会觉得抗击 全球贫困的头等要事

231
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.495
in the developing world would be a huge priority
是解决发展中国家最基本的

232
00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:57.735
for the global fight against poverty.
法律实施问题。

233
00:13:57.735 --> 00:13:59.868
But it's not.
但并不是这样的。

234
00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:04.645
Auditors of international assistance recently couldn't find

235
00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:08.479
even one percent of aid going  to protect the poor

236
00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:12.810
from the lawless chaos  of everyday violence.
用在帮助穷人逃脱暴力方面的部分 连百分之一都不到。

237
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.116
And honestly, when we do talk about  violence against the poor,
当我们谈论穷人面对的暴力问题时，

238
00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:19.625
sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.
状况却奇怪得让人匪夷所思。

239
00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:22.708
A fresh water organization tells a heart-wrenching story

240
00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:26.300
of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water,
女孩们在打水的路上遭到强暴，

241
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.110
and then celebrates the solution of a new well

242
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.565
that drastically shortens their walk.

243
00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:35.773
End of story.
一切就这样到此为止了。

244
00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:42.173
But not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community.
压根儿就没有提到 活跃在她们社区的暴力分子。

245
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.947
If a young woman on one  of our college campuses
如果我们这有一个女大学生

246
00:14:45.947 --> 00:14:49.093
was raped on her walk to the library, 
在去图书馆的路上遭人强暴，

247
00:14:49.093 --> 00:14:54.941
we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm.
我们绝对不会赞扬 将图书馆移到宿舍附近的解决办法。

248
00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:58.932
And yet, for some reason, this is okay for poor people.
但是出于某种原因，对于穷人而言， 这种办法却是可行的。

249
00:15:00.735 --> 00:15:03.289
Now the truth is, the traditional experts
事实上，

250
00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:05.595
in economic development and poverty alleviation,
传统的发展经济和抗击贫困的专家

251
00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:07.855
they don't know how to fix this problem.
并不知道如何解决这个问题。

252
00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:09.676
And so what happens?
那要怎么办呢？

253
00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:11.767
They don't talk about it.
他们只好对此保持沉默。

254
00:15:13.057 --> 00:15:17.228
But the more fundamental reason
但发展中国家的穷人

255
00:15:16.528 --> 00:15:20.008
that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world
得不到法律援助的现状 如此遭人冷落，

256
00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:21.892
is so neglected,
其更深层次的原因在于，

257
00:15:21.892 --> 00:15:25.777
is because the people inside the developing world, with money,
发展中国家的富人们

258
00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:27.895
don't need it.
根本不需要法律援助。

259
00:15:28.985 --> 00:15:31.565
I was at the World Economic  Forum not long ago
不久之前，在一个世界经济论坛上，

260
00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:35.509
talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world
我与几位跟发展中国家 有广泛商业往来的高管们交谈，

261
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:37.591
and I was just asking them,
我问他们，

262
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:43.145
"How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence?"
“你们这些人怎么 保护家人和财产不受侵害？”

263
00:15:43.145 --> 00:15:47.967
And they looked at each other,  and they said, practically in unison,
他们面面相觑，几乎异口同声地说，

264
00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.994
"We buy it."
“我们拿钱买保障。”

265
00:15:51.294 --> 00:15:55.156
Indeed, private security forces  in the developing world
事实上，发展中国家私人保卫力量

266
00:15:55.156 --> 00:16:01.966
are now, four, five and seven times larger than the public police force.
是公共警力的 五倍、六倍，甚至八倍。

267
00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:09.428
In Africa, the largest employer  on the continent now is private security.
在非洲这片大陆上， 目前最大的生意就是私人警卫。

268
00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:14.522
But see, the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer,
富人可以用金钱买来安全， 并能不断积累财富，

269
00:16:14.522 --> 00:16:18.324
but the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected
但穷人买不起， 只能深陷在危险的环境中，

270
00:16:18.324 --> 00:16:20.894
and they keep getting thrown to the ground.
这种情况愈演愈烈。

271
00:16:22.284 --> 00:16:26.716
This is a massive and scandalous outrage.
这种无处不在的丑闻 简直让我怒不可遏。

272
00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:29.669
And it doesn't have to be this way.
事实完全不必这样发展下去。

273
00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:32.236
Broken law enforcement can be fixed.
腐朽的法律实施系统可以修复。

274

they start out broken and corrupt,

Number one: We have to start making

stopping violence indispensable  to the fight against poverty.

282
00:16:55.398 --> 00:16:59.992
that doesn't include the problem  of violence must be deemed not serious.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.598
Recently, the Gates Foundation  funded a project

in the second largest city  of the Philippines,

where local advocates and local law enforcement

the commercial sexual violence  against poor kids by 79 percent.

You know, from the hindsight of history,

298
00:17:55.122 --> 00:18:00.679
what's always most inexplicable and inexcusable

299
00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:03.900
are the simple failures of compassion.
就是同情心的丧失。

300
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.028
Because I think history convenes  a tribunal of our grandchildren

301
00:18:10.028 --> 00:18:11.789
and they just ask us,

Where were you?

306
00:18:23.643 --> 00:18:26.043
And Grandma, where were you when they were marching

307
00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:30.096
our Japanese-American neighbors off to internment camps?

310
00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:38.278
just because they were trying to register to vote?"

311
00:18:38.278 --> 00:18:42.522
Likewise, when our grandchildren ask us,

312
00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:44.963
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you

when two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos

315
00:18:53.107 --> 00:18:59.672
I hope we can say that we had compassion, that we raised our voice,
我希望我们可以回答说： 我们赋予了同情心、发出了呼吁，

316
00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:07.504
and as a generation, we were moved to make the violence stop.

Talk to us a bit about some of the things

How hard a process is that?

323
00:19:39.247 --> 00:19:42.829
GH: Well, one of the glorious  things that's starting to happen now
GH: 现在正在进行的 最令人赞叹的事情之一就是

324
00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:47.439
is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious.
这些体系的坍塌及其 后果已浮出水面，

325
00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:50.801
There's actually, now,  political will to do that.
政客们正着力解决。

326
00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:54.926
But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise.

327

328

because we've done some examples around the world

at International Justice Mission that are very encouraging.

CA: 告诉我们，在一个国家，

332
00:20:09.053 --> 00:20:12.568
to make a material difference  to police, for example --

333
00:20:12.568 --> 00:20:14.358
I know that's only one piece of it.
我知道这只是其中一小部分。

334
00:20:14.358 --> 00:20:17.574
GH: In Guatemala, for instance, we've started a project there

335
00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:20.826
with the local police  and court system, prosecutors,
训练当地的警力、司法系统和检察官，

to retrain them so that they can  actually effectively bring these cases.
提升他们的执行能力， 以有效地将罪犯绳之以法。

increase by more than 1,000 percent.

340
00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:38.482
and the kind of bang  you can get for your buck
从中得到的丰硕的回报就是，

341
00:20:38.482 --> 00:20:42.658
in terms of leveraging a criminal justice system
如果可以训练出一只强大的队伍， 激励并有效地引领他们，

342
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:47.415
that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led,
打击罪犯、维护正义的体系 就可以高效地运作起来，

343

and these countries,  especially a middle class

344
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:53.102
that is seeing that there's  really no future

with this total instability and total privatization of security

346

I think there's an opportunity, a window for change.
但我认为现在已经有了 去改变这一现状的机会了。

CA: But to make this happen, you have to look at each part in the chain --

348
00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:07.496
the police, who else?
警方，还有呢？

349
00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:09.777
GH: So that's the thing  about law enforcement,
GH: 关于法律的实施，

350
00:21:09.777 --> 00:21:11.220
it starts out with the police,
从警方开始，

351
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.903
they're the front end of the pipeline of justice,
他们维护正义，奋斗在前线，

352
00:21:13.903 --> 00:21:15.850
but they hand if off to the prosecutors,
他们将罪犯送到检察官手里，

353
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.085
and the prosecutors  hand it off to the courts,

00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:21.377
and the survivors of violence  have to be supported by social services
惨遭暴力的幸存者始终都需要

355
00:21:20.297 --> 00:21:22.313
all the way through that.
得到社会的保障与支持。

356
00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:25.495
So you have to do an approach  that pulls that all together.
所以你需要做的就是 把这几方面结合在一起。

357
00:21:25.495 --> 00:21:28.546
In the past, there's been a little bit of training of the courts,
过去，对法院的培训很少，

358
00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.390
but they get crappy evidence  from the police,
法院只能从警方得到蹩脚的证据，

359
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.357
or a little police intervention  that has to do with narcotics or terrorism
姑且不说这对惩治毒贩 和恐怖分子有多少帮助，

360
00:21:34.357 --> 00:21:37.225
but nothing to do with treating the common poor person
他们在建立完善的法律实施体系来

361
00:21:36.705 --> 00:21:38.744
with excellent law enforcement,
保障广大穷人的利益方面 几乎没有任何作为，

362
00:21:38.744 --> 00:21:40.769
so it's about pulling that all together,
因此，我们需要把 每一个环节有机地结合起来，

363
00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:43.911
and you can actually have people in very poor communities

364
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:46.094
experience law enforcement like us,
像我们一样 得到法律的切实保障，

365
00:21:46.094 --> 00:21:48.916
which is imperfect in our  own experience, for sure,
或许我们还对身边的问题满腹牢骚，

366
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:52.048
but boy, is it a great thing to sense that you can call 911
但是当你知道只要拨打911，

367
00:21:52.048 --> 00:21:55.084
and maybe someone will protect you.

00:21:55.084 --> 00:21:57.357
CA: Gary, I think you've done  a spectacular job
CA: Gary, 你太了不起了，

369
00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:59.484
