Loneliness is not a function of being alone,

the very homes we choose to live in.

And the home might be in a neighborhood like this.

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.144
this home, this neighborhood --
在这样的一个小区里

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:08.065
it's a dream.
拥有一栋这样的房子。

23
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.519
And yet the danger of achieving this dream

24
00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:13.245
is a false sense of connection

25
00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:16.540
and an increase in social isolation.

I know, I can hear you now,

and I know everyone on my block!"

30
00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:29.175
To which I would answer, "Terrific!"

And I wish there were more people like you,

They might recognize them and say hello,

36
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.641
but under their breath,

37
00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.039
they're asking their spouse,

38
00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.461
"What was their name again?"

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:52.494
so they can ask a question by name to signify they know them.
这样才能正确称呼对方 以证明彼此是相识的。

40
00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:59.474
Social media also contributes to this false sense of connection.
社交网络的存在也 加剧了这种虚假的联系感。

41
00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:01.496
This image is probably all too familiar.

and everyone's on their phone.

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:24.347
and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

I find this incredibly isolating.

It's not a new concept.

In fact, it's an age-old way of living,

58
00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.405
and it still exists in many non-European cultures

59
00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.656
around the world.

我想先介绍我的朋友，希拉与斯潘塞。

They're now my neighbors.

We live in a cohousing community that I not only designed,

This community is very intentional about our social interactions.

So let me take you on a tour.

From the outside, we look like any other small apartment building.

87
00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:59.213
In fact, we look identical to the one next door,

88
00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:00.901

and this one is Spencer and Sheila's.

96
00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:20.698
are not the homes,
并非因为这些房间，

97

the social interactions that happen in and around that central courtyard.

I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.

Spencer waving at me furiously as we're making our breakfasts.
我都能看到斯潘塞热情地对我招手。

103
00:04:38.884 --> 00:04:41.374
From our homes, we look down into the courtyard,
当我们从家里俯视楼下的院子，

104
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.750
and depending on the time of year,

105
00:04:43.774 --> 00:04:45.123
we see this:

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:48.553
kids and grownups in various combinations

107
00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:50.941
playing and hanging out with each other.

There's a lot of giggling and chatter.

109
00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:54.934
There's a lot of hula-hooping.

110
00:04:55.887 --> 00:04:59.447
And every now and then, "Hey, quit hitting me!"

114
00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:11.687
At the bottom of the courtyard, there are a set of double doors,

and those lead into the common house.

116
00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:18.179
I consider the common house the secret sauce of cohousing.
在我看来，这个大厅 才是公共住宅的核心。

117
00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:19.366
It's the secret sauce
因为这里是

118
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.264
because it's the place where the social interactions
所有社交互动以及

119
00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.810
and community life begin,
社区生活的开始，

120
00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:28.493
and from there, it radiates out through the rest of the community.

121
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.047
Inside our common house, we have a large dining room

122
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:36.653
to seat all 28 of us and our guests,
可以容纳我们28人，包括我们的客人。

123
00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:38.851
and we dine together three times a week.
每周有三个晚上大家会进行聚餐。

124
00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:42.769
In support of those meals, we have a large kitchen

125
00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:45.288
so that we can take turns cooking for each other

126
00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.550
in teams of three.
可以轮流掌勺。

127
00:05:46.574 --> 00:05:48.773
So that means, with 17 adults,
也就是说，总共17个成年人，

128
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.368
I lead cook once every six weeks.

with the preparation and cleanup.

131
00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:58.180
And all those other nights,

00:05:58.204 --> 00:05:59.441
I just show up.

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:02.695
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors,
我们共享晚餐，与邻居们聊天，

134
00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.064
and I go home, having been fed a delicious meal
吃完为我精心准备的素食晚餐后，

135
00:06:04.954 --> 00:06:07.932
by someone who cares about my vegetarian preferences.

136
00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.397
Our nine families have intentionally chosen
我们九个家庭，特意选择了

137
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:14.942
an alternative way of living.
这样一种非典型的生活方式。

138
00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:17.775
Instead of pursuing the American dream,
与所谓的美国梦相悖，

139
00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:20.697
where we might have been isolated in our single-family homes,
我们选择了公共住宅，而不是

140
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:22.388
we instead chose cohousing,
孤立隔绝的单一家庭住宅，

141
00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.550
so that we can increase our social connections.
就为了能够加强彼此之间社会联系。

142
00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:28.059
And that's how cohousing starts:
这就是公共住宅的本意：

143
00:06:27.943 --> 00:06:29.661
with a shared intention
追求协作生活的

144
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:31.245
to live collaboratively.
共同意愿。

145
00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:34.148
And intention is the single most important characteristic

146
00:06:34.172 --> 00:06:37.231
that differentiates cohousing from any other housing model.
其他住宅模式不同的地方。

147
00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.590
And while intention is difficult to see
虽然意愿这种东西不易察觉，

148
00:06:40.614 --> 00:06:42.444
or even show,
也难以示人，

149
