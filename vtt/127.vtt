You know how people tell you if you get nervous when onstage,

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.916
picture people in the audience naked?
假想观众都没穿衣服就好了。

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.316
Like it's this thing that's supposed to make you feel better.
说的就像这真能让你感觉好点一样。

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.596
But I was thinking --
但是我一直在想——

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.036
picturing all of you naked in 2018 feels kind of weird and wrong.
在2018年想象你们都没穿衣服 实在有点不太对啊。

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.076
Like, we're working really hard on moving past stuff like that,
我们都有在努力克服这样的问题，

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.716
so we need a new method of dealing with
所以我们需要一种新方法，

10
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.830
if you get nervous onstage.
来应付舞台恐惧症。

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.036
And I realized that what I'd really like
我意识到，我真正想要的是

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.116
is that I can look at you as much as you're looking at me --
我能跟你们看着我一样看着你们，

13
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.556
just to even things out a little bit.
只是为了公平一点。

14
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.316
So if I had way more eyeballs,
所以如果我有更多眼睛的话，

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.116
then we'd all be really comfortable, right?
那我们就都会很舒服，对吧？

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.876
So in preparation for this talk, I made myself a shirt.
所以为了准备这次演讲 我给自己做了件T恤。

17
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.050
(Rattling)
（窸窸窣窣的声音）

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.740
(Laughter)
（笑声）

19
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.596
It's googly eyes.
这就是大眼睛T恤。

20
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.716
It took me 14 hours
花了我14个小时，

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.436
and 227 googly eyes to make this shirt.

22
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.516
And being able to look at you as much as you're looking at me
能够像你们看着我一样 看着你们这件事，

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.036
is actually only half of the reason I made this.
其实只是我制作 这件T恤的部分原因。

24
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.996
The other half is being able to do this.
另一半原因是我可以这么玩儿。

25
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.356
(Googly eyes rattle)
（大眼睛T恤的响声）

26
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.636
(Laughter)
（笑声）

27
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.396
So I do a lot of things like this.
我做过很多这样的事。

28
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.236
I see a problem and I invent some sort of solution to it.
我发现了一个问题， 就会发明某个解决方法来应对它。

29

For example, brushing your teeth.

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.036
Like, it's this thing we all have to do, it's kind of boring,
这就是一件大家都得做， 但是又有点无聊的事，

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.156
and nobody really likes it.
而且没人真正喜欢刷牙。

32
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.556
If there were any seven-year-olds in the audience,

33
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.076
they'd be like, "Yes!"
他们肯定会大喊“就是这样！”

34
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.940
So what about if you had a machine that could do it for you?
那么要不要来一台 自动帮你刷牙的机器呢？

35
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.740
(Laughter)
（笑声）

36
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.780
I call it ...
我给它取了名，

37
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.140
I call it "The Toothbrush Helmet."

38
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.500
(Laughter)
（笑声）

39
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.036

(Applause)
（掌声）

42
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.356
So my toothbrush helmet is recommended by zero out of 10 dentists,
10位牙医中，有0位 推荐了我的牙刷头盔，

43
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.556
and it definitely did not revolutionize the world of dentistry,
它也肯定不算颠覆 牙医界的伟大发明，

44
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.756
but it did completely change my life.
但它确实改变了我的生活。

45
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.236
Because I finished making this toothbrush helmet three years ago

46
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.796
and after I finished making it,

I went into my living room and I put up a camera,

and I filmed a seven-second clip of it working.

49
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.796
And by now,

50
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.716
this is a pretty standard modern-day fairy tale

She ignores all of them, starts a YouTube channel

and keeps on building robots.

as an inventor of useless machines,
无用机器发明者。

60
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.076

the easiest way to be at the top of your field

85
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.276
On the flip side of that,

I struggled with very severe performance anxiety.

The thing I'm writing about in the email and the thing I'm so upset about

is that I got a B on a math test.

I got interested in building robots,

and I wanted to teach myself about hardware.

106
00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.586

It has a high likelihood of failure
失败几率非常高，

it has a high likelihood of making you feel stupid.
这很有可能让你 觉得自己超级智障。

110

And that was my biggest fear at the time.
而那就是我当时最大的恐惧。

111
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.716
So I came up with a setup that would guarantee success 100 percent of the time.
所以我做了一个一定能 保证100%成功率的设定。

112
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.116
With my setup, it would be nearly impossible to fail.

And that was that instead of trying to succeed,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.700
I was going to try to build things that would fail.

building stupid things was actually quite smart,
但实际上，制作一无是处东西 其实还是个挺聪明的点子。

because as I kept on learning about hardware,

for the first time in my life,
我人生中第一次，

119
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.100
I did not have to deal with my performance anxiety.
不用应对自我表现方面的焦虑。

120
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.396
And as soon as I removed all pressure and expectations from myself,

121
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.796
that pressure quickly got replaced by enthusiasm,

122
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.580
and it allowed me to just play.
我就可以只是瞎玩了。

123
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.956

I'm interested in things that people struggle with.

that I can solve.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.876
So before I came here,

I sat down and I thought of some of the potential problems I might have

(Laughter)

141
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.440
Or that when I get nervous, my hands start shaking

142
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.636
and I'm really self-conscious about it.

143
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.796
Or that my fly has been open this entire time

and all of you noticed but I didn't,

but it's closed so we're all good on that one.

147
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.636
I remember when I was a kid,

I would have my notes on a piece of paper,

and I would put a notebook behind the paper

151
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.236
so that people wouldn't be able to see the paper quivering.

152
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.980
And I give a lot of talks.
我做过很多演讲。

153
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.876
I know that about half of you in the audience are probably like,

154
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.876
"Building useless machines is really fun,
“制作无用机器确实挺好玩，

155
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.556
but how is this in any way or form a business?"
但这怎么可能是商机呢？”

156
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.516
And giving talks is a part of it.
演讲就是其中的一部分，

157
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.596
And the arrangers always put out a glass of water for you onstage

and I always so badly want to drink that water,

160
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.756
but I don't dare to pick the glass up

161
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.076
because then people might be able to see that my hands are shaking.

162
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.196
So what about a machine that hands you a glass of water?

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.396
Sold to the nervous girl in the googly-eye shirt.

I still don't know what to call this,

but I think some sort of "head orbit device,"

171
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.876
because it rotates this platform around you

I already have

because I've built myself this job

or that I could --

It's something that I could never have planned for.

243
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.796
Instead it happened just because I was enthusiastic about what I was doing,

and I was sharing that enthusiasm with other people.

246
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.996
because it's this acknowledgment

247
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.420
that you don't always know what the best answer is.
你不一定知道最好的答案是什么。

248
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.316
And it turns off that voice in your head
它让你不再盲目认为 

249
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.796
that tells you that you know exactly how the world works.

250
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.156
And maybe a toothbrush helmet isn't the answer,

251
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.116
but at least you're asking the question.

252
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.356
