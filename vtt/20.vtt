[AI] 他不仅比第二个跑得快百分之一。

91
00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:55.962
but he doesn't run 10 times faster than I do --
[AI] 但他跑得并不比我快10倍--

92
00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:58.167
and I'm not a good runner. trust me on that.

98
00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:14.760
It varies only in a narrow range.

137
00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.980
And the reason I like this number is because it shows that. really.
[AI] 我喜欢这个数字的原因是因为它显示了这一点。真正地

138
00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:08.734
when it comes to success. it's unbounded.
[AI] 说到成功。它是无限的。

139
00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:14.619
that the best doesn't only get slightly more than the second best
[AI] 最好的不只是比第二好的多一点

140
00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.340
but gets orders of magnitude more.
[AI] 但得到的数量级更多。

141
00:07:17.364 --> 00:07:20.158
because success is a collective measure.
[AI] 因为成功是一个集体的尺度。

142
00:07:20.182 --> 00:07:24.558
We give it to them. rather than we earn it through our performance.
[AI] 我们把它给他们。而不是通过我们的表现来赢得。

143
00:07:24.582 --> 00:07:29.958
So one of things we realized is that performance. what we do. is bounded.
[AI] 所以我们意识到的一点是性能。我们所做的。是有界的。

144
00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:32.664
but success. which is collective. is unbounded.
[AI] 但是成功。这是集体的。是无限的。

145
00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:34.000
which makes you wonder:
[AI] 这让你想知道：

146
00:07:34.024 --> 00:07:36.935
How do you get these huge differences in success
[AI] 你是如何获得这些巨大的成功差异的

147
00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:39.865
when you have such tiny differences in performance?
[AI] 当你在表现上有如此微小的差异时？

148
00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:44.144
And recently. I published a book that I devoted to that very question.
[AI] 最近。我出版了一本书，专门讨论这个问题。

149
00:07:44.168 --> 00:07:47.007
And they didn't give me enough time to go over all of that.
[AI] 他们没有给我足够的时间来检查这些。

150
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.102
so I'm going to go back to the question of.
[AI] 所以我要回到这个问题上。

151
00:07:49.126 --> 00:07:52.261
alright. you have success; when should that appear?
[AI] 好吧你成功了；什么时候会出现？

152
00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:56.043
So let's go back to the party spoiler and ask ourselves:
[AI] 那么，让我们回到派对的扰流者，问问自己：

153
00:07:57.035 --> 00:08:00.374
Why did Einstein make this ridiculous statement.
[AI] 爱因斯坦为什么做出这种荒谬的声明。

154
00:08:00.398 --> 00:08:03.554
that only before 30 you could actually be creative?
[AI] 只有在30岁之前你才有创造力？

155
00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:08.258
Well. because he looked around himself and he saw all these fabulous physicists
[AI] 好因为他环顾四周，看到了所有这些神奇的物理学家

156
00:08:08.282 --> 00:08:10.869
that created quantum mechanics and modern physics.
[AI] 这创造了量子力学和现代物理学。

157
00:08:10.893 --> 00:08:14.629
and they were all in their 20s and early 30s when they did so.
[AI] 他们这么做的时候都是20多岁和30出头。

158
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.770
And it's not only him.
[AI] 而且不仅仅是他。

159
00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:18.417
It's not only observational bias.
[AI] 这不仅仅是观察偏差。

160
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:22.438
because there's actually a whole field of genius research

161
00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:24.718
that has documented the fact that.

162
00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:27.902
if we look at the people we admire from the past
[AI] 如果我们看看过去崇拜的人

163
00:08:27.926 --> 00:08:31.284
and then look at what age they made their biggest contribution.
[AI] 然后看看他们做出最大贡献的年龄。

164
00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:33.404
whether that's music. whether that's science.
[AI] 不管那是音乐。这是否是科学。

165
00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:35.047
whether that's engineering.
[AI] 不管那是工程。

most of them tend to do so in their 20s. 30s. early 40s at most.
[AI] 他们中的大多数人往往在20多岁时这样做。30多岁。最多40出头。

167
00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:44.525
But there's a problem with this genius research.

(Laughter)
[AI] （众笑）

172
00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:59.521
And it also has an observational bias.
[AI] 而且它也有观测偏差。

173
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:04.507
because it only looks at geniuses and doesn't look at ordinary scientists
[AI] 因为它只关注天才，不关注普通科学家

174
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.496
and doesn't look at all of us and ask.
[AI] 而不是看着我们所有人问。

175
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.705
is it really true that creativity vanishes as we age?
[AI] 创造力真的会随着年龄的增长而消失吗？

176
00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:12.079
So that's exactly what we tried to do.

177
00:09:12.103 --> 00:09:15.906
and this is important for that to actually have references.
