00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:14.353
You may not realize this,
或许你并没有意识到，

2
00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:19.233
but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy.
你身体里的细菌比银河系中的星星还要多。

3
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.987
This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us
我们体内这迷人的“细菌宇宙”

4
00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.263
is an integral part of our health,
是我们身体健康不可缺少的组成部分，

5
00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:27.352
and our technology is evolving so rapidly
而高科技的迅速发展

6
00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:32.111
that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers.
允许我们像处理计算机程序一样处理这些细菌。

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.759
Now, the diagram that you see here,
现在，你看到的这张图，

8
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.290
I know it looks like some kind of sports play,
我知道这看起来像是某种体育运动的示意图，

9
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.446
but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed.
但实际上是我开发的第一个细菌程序。

10
00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:44.767
And like writing software, we can print and write DNA
就像写软件代码那样，我们可以依据不同的算法

11
00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.994
into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria.
输出和撰写DNA序列，并在细菌内部编写程序。

12
00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:52.777
What this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion
这个程序做的事情就是按照一定的节奏生产荧光蛋白，

13
00:00:52.777 --> 00:00:54.379
and generates a small molecule
并生成一个小分子，

14
00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.957
that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize,
让细菌可以彼此联系，实现信息同步，

15
00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.795
as you're seeing in this movie.
正如你在这个影片里看到的。

16
00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.605
The growing colony of bacteria that you see here
这个成长中的菌落，

17
00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:03.598
is about the width of a human hair.
和人类头发的宽度差不多大小。

18
00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:06.105
Now, what you can't see is that our genetic program
但你们看不到我们的基因程序如何

19
00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.588
instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules,
指导这些细菌各自产生小分子，

20
00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:13.001
and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria
这些分子在数千个细菌个体之间游移，

21
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.717
telling them when to turn on and off.
告诉它们什么时候开启和关闭相应的功能。

22
00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:18.968
And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale,
在这个尺度下，细菌同步表现得很好，

23
00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.962
but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast,
但因为这些让细菌同步的分子移动速度非常快，

24
00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:29.440
in larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other,
在比较大的菌落里，将导致在相距较远的细菌个体间产生传导波动，

25
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.176
and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen.
你可以看到这样的波动从荧幕的右边向左移动。

26
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:37.137
Now, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing,
我们的遗传程序依赖于一种叫做“群体感应”的自然现象，

27
00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:40.469
in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors
一旦菌落达到临界密度，细菌之间就会开始激发相互协调，

28
00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.410
once they reach a critical density.
有时甚至会产生致命后果的行为。

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.065
You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie,
在这段视频中，你能观察到活动中的“群体感应”现象，

30
00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:52.078
where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density.
成长中的菌落只有在达到高密度或临界密度的时候才会开始发光。

31
00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.920
Our genetic program
我们的基因程序

32
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.439
continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards.
在菌落向外蔓延时，有节奏地持续制造荧光蛋白。

33
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.130
This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova,
我们称这个特别的影片和这个实验为“超级新星”，

34
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.160
because it looks like an exploding star.
因为这看起来很像星星大爆炸。

35
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.550
Now, besides programming these beautiful patterns,
除了编译这些美丽的图样外，

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.141
I wondered, what else can we get these bacteria to do?
我开始思考，我们还能让这些细菌做些什么？

37
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.720
And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria
我决定探索研究要如何编程细菌

38
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.509
to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer.
去发现和治疗身体内的疾病，比如癌症。

39
00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.127
One of the surprising facts about bacteria
细菌的一个不可思议之处在于，

40
00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:23.564
is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors.
它们可以在肿瘤内部自然地生长。

41
00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:25.328
This happens because typically tumors
这是因为，一般的肿瘤

42
00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:27.743
are areas where the immune system has no access,
是免疫系统涉及不到的区域，

43
00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:29.740
and so bacteria find these tumors
所以当细菌发现这些肿瘤时，

44
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.571
and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive.
会将肿瘤当做避风港，在其中茁壮成长。

45
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.405
We started using probiotic bacteria
我们开始使用益生菌，

46
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.029
which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit,
它们安全并且对健康有益，

47
00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.490
and found that when orally delivered to mice,
随后发现，当老鼠口服益生菌时，

48
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.646
these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors.
这些益生菌会选择生长在肝脏的肿瘤里。

49
00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:46.600
We realized that the most convenient way
我们意识到最简便的

50
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.681
to highlight the presence of the probiotics,
标记出益生菌，

51
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.544
and hence, the presence of the tumors,
进而让肿瘤现形的方式，

52
00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:52.773
was to get these bacteria to produce a signal
是让这些益生菌产生

53
00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.889
that would be detectable in the urine,
可以在尿液中被检测到的信号，

54
00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.301
and so we specifically programmed these probiotics
所以我们特别编译了这些益生菌，

55
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.180
to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine
让它们产生可以改变你尿液颜色的分子，

56
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.990
to indicate the presence of cancer.
以此实现癌症的检测。

57
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.000
We went on to show that this technology
我们随后证明了这项技术

58
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.960
could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer,
对肝癌的检测具有高灵敏度和准确度，

59
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.880
one that is challenging to detect otherwise.
而肝癌很难通过其他方式检测到。

60
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.710
Now, since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors,
既然知道这些细菌能准确定位肿瘤，

61
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.298
we've been programming them to not only detect cancer
我们又试着实现不止能检测癌症，

62
00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:19.086
but also to treat cancer
还能治疗癌症的编译，

63
00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:22.313
by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment
通过从肿瘤内部产生治疗分子，

64
00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:24.635
that shrink the existing tumors,
让现有的肿瘤萎缩，

65
00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:27.390
and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs
而我们已经在用群体感应程序来实现这一过程了，

66
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.233
like you saw in the previous movies.
就像之前影片中看到的一样。

67
00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:32.930
Altogether, imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic
想象一下，未来可以通过服用这些编译后的细菌

68
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.409
that could detect and treat cancer,
来检测和治疗癌症，

69
00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.990
or even other diseases.
甚至是其他疾病。

70
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.424
Our ability to program bacteria
我们能够编译细菌

71
00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:42.119
and program life
以及生命的能力，

72
00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.068
opens up new horizons in cancer research,
为癌症研究打开了新的天地，

73
00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:47.803
and to share this vision, I worked with artist Vik Muniz
为了分享这个美好的愿景，我和艺术家Vik Muniz合作，

74
00:03:47.803 --> 00:03:49.619
to create the symbol of the universe,
创作了这个完全由细菌和

75
00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.260
made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells.
癌症细胞所组成的宇宙符号。

76
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:58.465
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe
最终，我希望这个美丽的微观世界和它的存在意义，

77
00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:03.364
can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research.
能够给未来的癌症研究方法带来新的创意。

78
00:04:03.364 --> 00:04:05.988
Thank you.
谢谢。

79
00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:09.754
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
