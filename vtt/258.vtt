Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me,

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.476
because trusting big institutions,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.300

and that has made my story so different.

23
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.276
Instead of running away from big institutions,

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.116
I've actually run toward them.

I've had the chance over the course of my career

the White House

I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave,

that the institution of the global capital markets,

global capital markets, positive social change,

42

that is not affected by our wishes or desires.

46

47
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.236
or retirement accounts can do

is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles

and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones,

50
00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:24.876
but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts

51
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.396
don't affect the tides,

don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.

53
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.836
But why is that?
但原因何在呢？

54
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.196
Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital

55
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.836
actually belongs to individuals like us,

56
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.916
and most of the rest of the capital markets

57
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.156
is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority

58
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.956
and their capital from us,

59
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.116
as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.
我们是成员、参与者、受益人、股东或者公民。

60
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.980
So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets,
既然我们是资本市场的最终拥有者，

61
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.180
why aren't we able to make our voices heard?

62
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.740
Why can't we make some waves?

63
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.676
So let me ask you a different question:
我先问你们另一个问题：

64
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.916
did any of you buy fair trade coffee
你们最近一次去超市或者星巴克，

65
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.596
the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks?

66
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.036
OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant

67
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.716
and order the sustainably farmed trout
为了环保，点养殖鲑鱼，

68
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.276
instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass

69
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.020
that you really wish you could have?
尽管你很想吃野生的？

70
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.660
Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
有没有人开混合动力车甚至电动车？

71
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.356
So why do we do these things?
我们究竟为什么要做这些事情？

72
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.236
Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion
对吧？1辆电动车对12亿辆燃油车，

73
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.740
combustion engine vehicles.
简直太微不足道。

74
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.260
One fish is just one fish in the sea.
一条鱼对于整个海洋算不了什么。

75
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.156
And one cup of coffee
一杯咖啡

76
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.740
doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
对于堆积成山的咖啡豆同样微不足道。

77
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.756
But we do these things because we believe they matter,
但我们做这些事情， 是因为我们相信它有意义，

78
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.036
that our actions add up,
我们的行动能积少成多，

79
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.956
that our choices might influence others
能影响周围的人，

80
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.140
and collectively, what an impact we can have.

81
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.676
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.
我包里有一个咖啡杯，好几年前买的。

82
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.636
It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it.
它能反复使用。 上面印了许多话。

83
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.756
Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.
其中几句是这样说的。

84
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.316
"This one cup can be used again and again."

86
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.516
"This one cup helps save the planet."

87
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.996
I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.
我真没想到一个塑料杯子这么牛。

88
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.116
(Laughter)
（笑声）

89
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.036
So why do we think that our choice
因此，我们为何会认为

90
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.876
of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee
购买4美元一杯的公平贸易树荫咖啡，

91
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.076
in a reusable mug matters,
用可重复使用的马克杯就有意义，

92
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.862
but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account
而善用我们的退休金投资账户 里的4000美金，

93
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.286
for our IRA doesn't?
就没意义呢？

94
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.716
Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets
为什么我们不告诉超市，告诉资本市场

95
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.156
that we care,
我们并不冷漠，

96
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.436
that we care about fair labor standards,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.796

and about healthy communities?

99
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.716
Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars,
为何我们不靠投资来表明态度，

100
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.380
but we would vote with our lattes?
而要靠拿铁？

101
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.556
So I think it has something to do with the myths,
我觉得这跟我们的错误观念有关，

102
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.796
the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.
而这一观念在我们的集体意识中根深蒂固。

103
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.396
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?
大家还记得《格林童话》中那个神奇的粥锅吗？

104
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.796
If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil,"
如果你对粥锅说， “煮吧，小锅，煮吧”

105
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.116
it would fill up with sweet porridge.
它就会煮出一锅香甜的粥。

106
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.236
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"
如果你说，“停止吧，小锅，别煮了”

107
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.460
it would stop.
它就会停下来。

108
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.436
But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen,
但如果你记错了咒语， 小锅就不会听你的，

109
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.220
and things could go terribly awry.
事情会变得一团糟。

110
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.196
So I think when it comes to markets,
因此当我们讲到市场的时候，

111
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.716
we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.
我们心里会有一个错觉。

112
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.076
We believe that the markets is this magic pot
我们觉得市场就像那个神奇的小锅一样，

113
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.956
that obeys only one command:

114
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.020
make more money.
赚更多的钱。

115
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.636
Only those words said exactly that way
只有准确无误地说出这句咒语，

116
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.500
will make the pot fill up with gold.
小锅才会装满金子。

117
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.796
Add in some extra words like "protect the environment,"
一旦加上多余的话，比如“保护环境”，

118
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.460
the spell might not work.
咒语就失效了。

119
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.980
Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice,"
加上几个错误的词，比如“促进社会公平”，

120
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.396
and you might see your gold coins shrink
你的金币就缩水了，

121
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.260
or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.
甚至完全消失，这就是我们的错觉。

122
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.036
So we asked people, what do you really think?
因此我们问了很多人，你们到底是怎么想的？

123
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.276
And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors,

124
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.316
and we found something fascinating.

125
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.836
Overwhelmingly,
绝大部分的人，

126
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.476
people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.

71 percent of people said yes,

they were interested in sustainable investing,

129
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.116

that you already have traditionally

131
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.956
and adding in the extra information you get

132
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.236
when you think about the environment and society and good governance.

133
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.996
71 percent wanted that.

135
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.516
would actually do better financially.

136
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.196
So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.
由此看来，人们真的相信善有善报。

137
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.636
But here was the weird thing:

138
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.196
54 percent of the people

139

141
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.316

Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee

143
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.380
instead of drinking it?
你会亏吗？

144
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.836
Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees
伯特小蜜蜂和本杰利公司的投资者

145
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.636
