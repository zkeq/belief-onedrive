I wanted to be a psychologist since I was a teenager,

我没有在医院或诊所全职工作， 而是选择了这一步险棋，

I walked home to my apartment

then it shuddered and stalled between floors.

And the man who dealt with emergencies for a living

began poking at the buttons and banging on the door, saying,

I had nothing left to give, and that confused me.

For a few terrible weeks,

I questioned whether I'd made a mistake.

The problem wasn't the work I did in my office.

35
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.667
It was the hours I spent ruminating about work

I closed the door to my office every night,

38
00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:07.758
but the door in my head remained wide-open

39

That's the interesting thing about work stress.

00:02:13.853 --> 00:02:17.318
We don't really experience much of it at work.

to de-stress and do things we enjoy,

49
00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:36.469

50
00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:38.326
Because each time we do it,

51
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.580
we're actually activating our stress response.
其实是在激活我们 的压力反应。

52
00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:44.531
Now, to ruminate means to chew over.

The word refers to how cows digest their food.

(Laughter)
（笑声）

61
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.758

It does not work for humans.

Because what we chew over are the upsetting things,

the distressing things,

00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:20.834
It's the hours we spend obsessing about tasks we didn't complete

replaying the same thoughts and worries over and over again,

significantly disrupts our ability to recover and recharge in the off hours.

77
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:52.531
The more we ruminate about work when we're home,

78
00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.206

更别提对我们的亲密关系 和家庭生活造成的负担，

85
00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:17.855
because people around us can tell we're checked out and preoccupied.
因为我们身边的人能察觉 我们魂不守舍、心不在焉。

86
00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.340
Now, those same studies found

87
00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:23.276
that while ruminating about work when we're home
虽然在家时反刍工作

88
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.753
damages our emotional well-being,

89
00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:30.530
thinking about work in creative or problem-solving ways does not.

90
00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:35.087
Because those kinds of thinking do not elicit emotional distress

And they are very difficult to resist,

101
00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:08.464
because thinking of all our unfinished tasks feels urgent.

Anxiously worrying about the future feels compelling.

I decided to keep a journal for a week

In total, that week, it was almost 14 hours.
那个星期的反刍时间加起来 总计近 14 个小时。

126

But ruminating was destroying that love

and it was destroying my personal life, too.

So I read every study I could find,

and I went to war against my ruminations.

Now, habit change is hard.
