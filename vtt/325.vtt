00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.876
Twelve years ago, I picked up a camera for the first time
十二年前，我第一次拿起相机

2
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.020
to film the olive harvest in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.
去拍摄一个位于约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦村庄的橄榄收割活动

3
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.116
I thought I was there to make a single documentary
我本打算去那里拍一个纪录片

4
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.996
and would then move on to some other part of the world.
然后就会离开去其他地方

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.300
But something kept bringing me back.
但有些东西让我一直割舍不开

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.116
Now, usually, when international audiences hear about that part of the world,
现如今，当国际上的听众了解世界的那个部分后

7
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.676
they often just want that conflict to go away.
他们只希望冲突早点结束

8
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.340
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad, and we wish it could just disappear.
巴以冲突严重，我们只想它能消失

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.300
We feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world.
我们对世界上的其他冲突也怀有同样的感受

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.116
But every time we turn our attention to the news,
但好像每次我们注意到新闻

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100
it seems like one more country has gone up in flames.
都会有另一个国家陷入战火

12
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.836
So I've been wondering
所以我一直在想

13
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.180
whether we should not start looking at conflict in a different way --
我们是否应该从不同的角度看待冲突

14
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.956
whether instead of simply wishing to end conflict,
是否应该聚焦于冲突是如何发动的

15
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.996
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.
而不是仅仅希望能结束冲突

16
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.076
This has been a big question for me,
这对我而言一直是个大问题

17
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.740
one I've pursued together with my team at the nonprofit Just Vision.
一个我和我在非盈利组织Just Vision的团队一直在追寻的问题

18
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.236
After witnessing several different kinds of struggles in the Middle East,
在目睹了中东地区几种不同的尝试之后

19
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.476
I started noticing some patterns on the more successful ones.
我开始注意到那些更为成功的尝试所具有的方式

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.636
I wondered whether these variables held across cases, and if they did,
我想知道这些变量是否存在于其他情况，如果是的话

21
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:34.420
what lessons we could glean for waging constructive conflict, in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.
我们能从中学到哪些以在巴基斯坦、以色列等开展建设性冲突

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.740
There is some science about this.
这背后有其科学道理

23
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.756
In a study of 323 major political conflicts from 1900 to 2006,
在一项关于1900年~2006年间的323起政治冲突的研究中

24
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.076
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns
Maria Stephan 和 Erica Chenoweth发现非暴力运动

25
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.340
were almost 100 percent more likely to lead to success than violent campaigns.
相较于暴力运动高出接近一倍的成功率

26
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.196
Nonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm

27
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.156
to those waging the campaign,
造成身体上的伤害

28
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.316
as well as their opponents.
对其对手而言也是如此

29
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.220
And, critically, they typically lead to more peaceful and democratic societies.
并且，严格说来，也通常会得到更和平和民主的社会

30
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.956
In other words, nonviolent resistance is a more effective and constructive way
换句话说，非暴力抵抗是一个更高效和建设性的

31
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.180
of waging conflict.
发起抗争的方法

32
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.740
But if that's such an easy choice, why don't more groups use it?
但如果这是个显而易见的选择，为什么没有更多的团体运用它？

33
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.716
Political scientist Victor Asal and colleagues
政治学家 Victor Asal 和他的同事

34
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.100
have looked at several factors that shape a political group's choice of tactics.
调查了影响政治团体策略选择的几个因素

35
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:41.156
And it turns out that the greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence or violence
结果表明影响一个运动采取非暴力或是暴力的决定的最大影响因素

36
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.516
is not whether that group is more left-wing or right-wing,
不是这个团体是更偏向左翼还是右翼

37
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.636
not whether the group is more or less influenced by religious beliefs,
也不是团体被宗教信仰影响的多少

38
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.716
not whether it's up against a democracy or a dictatorship,
不是它反抗的是民主还是独裁

39
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.340
and not even the levels of repression that that group is facing.
甚至也不是这个团体遭受镇压迫的水平

40
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.140
The greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence
影响一个运动的采用非暴力的决定的最大因素是

41
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.380
is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life.
它关于女人在公共生活中角色的意识形态

42
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.420
(Applause)
[掌声]

43
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.916
When a movement includes in its discourse
当一个运动在其议题中

44
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.676
language around gender equality,
包含性别平等时

45
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.036
it increases dramatically the chances it will adopt nonviolence,
它采取非暴力的几率戏剧性增长

46
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.380
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.
如此一来，它成功的可能性也相应增长

47
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.236
The research squared up with my own documentation of political organizing in Israel and Palestine.
这项研究和我自己对巴以政治组织的记录结论不谋而合

48
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.676
I've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions,
我注意到那些欢迎女性进入领导层的运动

49
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.996
such as the one I documented in a village called Budrus,
比如我在一个叫做Budrus的村子记录的一个例子

50
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.620
were much more likely to achieve their goals.
就非常容易实现他们的目标

51
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.756
This village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map
当以色列开始修建隔离墙的时候

52
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.620
when Israel started building the separation barrier.
这个村子面临这被从地图上抹去的切实危险

53
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.236
The proposed route would require

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.756
the destruction of this community's olive groves, their cemeteries
摧毁这个社区的橄榄园、他们的墓地

55
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.620
and would ultimately enclose the village from all sides.
还会将这个村子从各个方向上完全隔离开来

56
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.356
Through inspired local leadership,

57
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.020
they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening.

58

59
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.740

a 15-year-old girl

61
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.236
who courageously jumped in front of a bulldozer

which was about to uproot an olive tree, stopping it.

63
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.036
In that moment, the community of Budrus realized what was possible

64
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.660
if they welcomed and encouraged women to participate in public life.
如果他们欢迎并鼓励女人参与到公共生活中去

65
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.236
And so it was that the women of Budrus went to the front lines day after day,
也正是Budrus的女人们日复一日地到前线

using their creativity and acumen to overcome multiple obstacles they faced in a 10-month unarmed struggle.
发挥她们的创造性和敏锐性以克服她们在为期10个月的非武装斗争中面临的众多障碍

正如你可以想见的那样

68
00:04:48.844 --> 00:04:50.044
they win at the end.
她们最终赢了

69

I want to pause for a second, which you helped me do,

because I do want to tackle two very serious misunderstandings

women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.996

reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways

92
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.676
Now to the second potential misunderstanding.
至于第二个可能的误解

I've been talking a lot about my experiences in the Middle East,

94
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.556
and some of you might be thinking now

that the solution then is for us to educate Muslim and Arab societies

to be more inclusive of their women.

but they tend to be invisible to the international community.

101
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.636
Our cameras are largely focused on the men

who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes

103
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.260
that we find so irresistible in our news cycle.

104
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.716
And we end up with a narrative that not only erases women from the struggles in the region

105
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.380
but often misrepresents the struggles themselves.
而且错误描述了运动本身的叙事方法

In the late 1980s, an uprising started in Gaza,
在20世纪80年代后期，一场起义发端于加沙

and people who have any visual memory of it

110
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.620

were the only activities taking place in the Intifada.

cutting across generations, factions and class lines.

They did this through networks of popular committees,

121
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.236
and their use of direct action and communal self-help projects

122
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.380
challenged Israel's very ability to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.
直接挑战了以色列持续统治西岸和加沙的能力

123
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.756
According to the Israeli Army itself,

124
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.340
97 percent of activities during the First Intifada were unarmed.
大起义期间，百分之97的活动是没有武装的

For 18 months in the Intifada,
