你设计了一种产品

3
00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.600
a new type of product, called the human immune system.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.446
You're pitching this product
你在向一个持质疑态度

5
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.627
to a skeptical, strictly no-nonsense manager.
不容许讲废话的经理推销这种产品

6
00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:29.644
Let's call him Bob.
让我们叫他鲍勃

7
00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:31.830
I think we all know at least one Bob, right?
我想每个人都至少认识一个鲍勃，对吧

8
00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:34.533
How would that go?
将会发生什么呢

9
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.777
Bob, I've got this incredible idea
鲍勃，我有了一个美妙的想法

10
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.433
for a completely new type of personal health product.
我要做一种全新的个人健康产品

11
00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.628
It's called the human immune system.

12
00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:46.496
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.
我能从你的反应看出你不太相信

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.596
Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.
不要担心，我知道这不好理解

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.277
I don't want to take you through the gory details,
我不会赘述令人肉麻的细节

15
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.529
I just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product.
我只想告诉你这种产品的几个惊人之处

16
00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:58.482
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy
首先，它巧妙地使用了庞大性

17
00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:01.638
by having millions of copies of each component --
它拥有上百万备用的同种组织

18
00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.847
leukocytes, white blood cells --
——比如血白细胞——

19
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:09.140
before they're actually needed, to create a massive buffer against the unexpected.
来制造应对突发情况的有效方案

20
00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:13.456
And it cleverly leverages diversity
其次它有着多样性

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.201
by having not just leukocytes but B cells, T cells,
不只是有白血细胞，还有B细胞、T细胞、

22
00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:19.433
natural killer cells, antibodies.
自然杀伤细胞和抗体

23
00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.465
The components don't really matter.
重要的不是它的组成部分

24
00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.059
The point is that together,
重要的是合在一起

25
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:27.699
this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything
这种有着不同种类的多样性

26
00:01:27.723 --> 00:01:29.876
that evolution has been able to throw up.
几乎可以解决进化中出现的所有问题

27
00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:35.112
And the design is completely modular.
而且它的设计十分模块化

28
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.969
You have the surface barrier of the human skin,
有着人体皮肤的表面保护

29
00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:42.214
you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system
不仅有与生俱来的反应敏捷的免疫机制

30
00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:46.260
and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
还有着适应力极强的高效免疫系统

31
00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:50.682
The point is, that if one system fails, another can take over,
即使一种机制失效另一种也能及时补上

32
00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.757
creating a virtually foolproof system.
创造出十分安全的系统

33
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.281
I can see I'm losing you, Bob, but stay with me,
我知道你开始听不懂了，鲍勃但请听我说完

34
00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:00.609
because here is the really killer feature.
因为现在才是产品的杀手锏

35
00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:04.160
The product is completely adaptive.
这种产品具有极强的适应力

36
00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.151
It's able to actually develop targeted antibodies

37
00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:11.691
to threats that it's never even met before.
制造出相应的抗体

38
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.300
It actually also does this with incredible prudence,
它还十分精准

39
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:20.999
detecting and reacting to every tiny threat,
发现并对每种危机做出反应

40
00:02:21.023 --> 00:02:25.358
and furthermore, remembering every previous threat,
并且记住每一次外界入侵

41
00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:27.952
in case they are ever encountered again.
以防再次遭遇同种危险

42
00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:32.225
What I'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product.
我今天想和你们讲的其实不是一种独立运作的产品

43
00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.804
The product is embedded in the larger system of the human body,
这种产品与整个人体相结合

44
00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:40.741
and it works in complete harmony with that system,
并且和整体和谐共处

45
00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.819
to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
创造出了史无前例的生物保护机制

46
00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:47.068
So Bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?
鲍勃，请你诚实地告诉我你觉得这款产品怎么样？

47
00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:50.686
And Bob may say something like,
鲍勃可能会说

48
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.625
I sincerely appreciate the effort and passion
我真挚地赞赏你在展示中

49
00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.492
that have gone into your presentation,
所表现出的努力和热情

50
00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:57.670
blah blah blah --
啦啦啦啦……

51
00:02:57.694 --> 00:02:58.874
(Laughter)
（笑声）

52
00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:01.951
But honestly, it's total nonsense.
但是讲实话，简直是胡说八道

53
00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:07.270
You seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product
你似乎在讲你产品的买点

54
00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:09.995
are that it is inefficient and complex.
是它的极其低效和冗杂

55
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.590
Didn't they teach you 80-20?
你难道没有学过80/20法则吗？

56
00:03:13.513 --> 00:03:16.941
And furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed.
而且你还似乎在说这种产品很浪费

57
00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:18.901
It overreacts,
它反应过激

58
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:20.464
makes things up as it goes along
制造出东西又无的放矢

59
00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:22.979
and is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.
效益明显不高

60
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:26.610
I'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't think this one is a winner.
很抱歉让你遗憾了但它肯定没有希望

61
00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:29.033
If we went with Bob's philosophy,
如果我们同意鲍勃的观点

62
00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:32.525
I think we'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system.
我们实际上肯定了一种更为高效的免疫系统

63
00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.555
And efficiency is always important in the short term.
而且效率在短期来说往往十分重要

64
00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:40.118
Less complex, more efficient, more bang for the buck.
少些复杂，多些效率更合算些

65
00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:41.500
Who could say no to that?
谁会拒绝这些好处呢？

66
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.358
Unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem,
不幸的是，有一个小小的问题

67
00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:47.647
and that is that the user of this product, you or I,
那就是如果你我有着这样的免疫系统

68
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.344
would probably die within one week of the next winter,
那么在遭遇新型传染病毒时

69
00:03:51.368 --> 00:03:55.232
when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.
你我可能活不过下一个冬天的头一周

70
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:01.181
I first became interested in biology and business,
我第一次对生物与商业

71
00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:03.584
and longevity and resilience,
以及持久性和抗压性赶到兴趣

72
00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:08.555
when I was asked a very unusual question by the CEO of a global tech company.
是在被一个全球科技公司的CEO问了一个问题时

73
00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:10.527
And the question was:
那个问题是

74
00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:16.713
What do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?
怎样确保我们的公司能够持续运作100年？

75
00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:20.201
A seemingly innocent question,
看上去是一个幼稚的问题

76
00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:23.036
but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think,
但是问题远没有你想的这么简单

77
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:28.387
considering that the average US public company now
美国现在普通的公共公司

78
00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:31.909
can expect a life span of only 30 years.
通常只有30年的寿命

79
00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:35.574
That is less than half of the life span
这几乎是它的员工

80
00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:38.424
that its employees can expect to enjoy.
工作寿命的一半

81
00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:41.819
Now, if you were the CEO of such a company,
现在，如果你是这样一个公司的CEO

82
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.530
badgered by investors and buffeted by change,
被投资者纠缠不放因变化而遭受打击

83
00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.714
we might forgive you for not even worrying too much
可以理解你不为

84
00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:50.439
about what happens 30 years out.
之后30年的事操心太多

85
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.168
But here's something that should keep you awake at night:
但有些事可能会让你难以入眠

86
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.245
the probability that your company will not be around in five year's time,
你的公司在5年后倒闭的可能性

87
00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:02.908
on average, is now a staggering 32 percent.
平均在32%上下浮动

88
00:05:03.984 --> 00:05:08.028
That's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over
也就是有三分之一的几率

89
00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:10.845
or will fail within just five years.
你的公司会在5年后被转手或是倒闭

90
00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:15.830
Let's come back to our tech CEO's question.
又来说说科技公司老板的问题

91
00:05:15.854 --> 00:05:19.633
Where better to turn for advice than nature,
哪里有向比大自然求教更好的呢？

92
00:05:19.657 --> 00:05:24.241
that's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company?
大自然已经在生死轮回的游戏中比任何公司存活得都要久了

93
00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:28.750
As a lapsed biologist,
作为一个不务正业的生物学家

94
00:05:28.774 --> 00:05:32.135
I decided to immediately call a real biologist,
我马上联系了一个更专业的生物学者

95
00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.173
my friend Simon Levin,
我朋友赛门·莱文

96
00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:37.401
Professor of Biology and Mathematics at Princeton University.
普林斯顿大学的生物学和数学教授

97
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:41.911
Together, we looked at a variety of biological systems,
我们共同研究了许多生态系统

98
00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:45.201
ranging from natural tropical rainforests
从自然热带雨林

99
00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:48.147
through to managed forests and fisheries.
到人造森林和鱼塘

100
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:49.895
And we asked ourselves the question:
我们问了自己一个问题

101
00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.777
What makes these systems resilient and enduring?
是什么使这些系统具有抗压能力和持续性

102
00:05:55.996 --> 00:06:00.141
And what we found was that the same six principles
我们发现恰恰是支撑着人体免疫系统的

103
00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:03.190
that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system
六条规律

104
00:06:03.214 --> 00:06:06.275
actually cropped up again and again,
一次又一次地表现出来

105
00:06:06.977 --> 00:06:10.011
from redundancy through to embeddedness.
从庞大性到镶嵌性

106
00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.095
In fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems,
事实上，我们不只是在生物持久的系统中发现这些规律

107
00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:20.401
we also found them being very characteristic of long-lived social systems,
我们还发现 它们在寿命长久的社会系统中也表现得十分突出

108
00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.643
like the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church,
就像在罗马帝国和天主教堂中的表现

109
00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:23.965
believe it or not.
——信不信由你——

110
00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:25.827
We also went on to look at business,
我们还研究了商界

111
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.707
and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses
也发现它们在坚韧且长久的企业中

112
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.691
that were resilient and long-lived,
表现的非常明显

113
00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:36.834
and we noted their absence from ones which were short-lived.
并且发现了短命的企业中这种品质的缺失

114
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:44.193
Let's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses.
先来看看当企业的免疫机制失效时会发生什么

115
00:06:45.022 --> 00:06:50.911
This beautiful building is part of the Shitennoji Temple Complex in Osaka, Japan.
这栋美丽的建筑是日本大阪四天王寺寺庙的一部分

116
00:06:51.492 --> 00:06:54.332
In fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.
事实上它是日本最老的建筑之一

117
00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:57.213
It was built by a Korean artisan,
它由一个韩国工匠修建

118
00:06:57.237 --> 00:07:00.306
because at the time, Japan was not yet building temples.
由于在那时日本还不会修建寺庙

119
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:05.493
And this Korean artisan went on to found a temple-building company.
这个韩国工匠创建了一个修建寺庙的公司

120
00:07:06.837 --> 00:07:10.242
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,
十分神奇的是，他的公司Kongō Gumi

121
00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:15.490
was still around 1,428 years later.
在1480年后仍然存在

122
00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:20.382
In fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world.
实际上，它成为了世界上持续经营的最古老的公司

123
00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:23.819
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?
Kongō Gumi现在怎么样了呢

124
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.557
Not too well, I'm afraid.
恐怕不是很好

125
00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:32.534
It borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the Japanese economy,
在日本经济泡沫时期借了很重的债

126
00:07:32.558 --> 00:07:34.021
to invest in real estate.
来投资房地产

127
00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:37.476
And when the bubble burst, it couldn't refinance its loans.
当经济泡沫破裂时它不能偿还债务

128
00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:39.571
The company failed,

129
00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:42.812
and it was taken over by a major construction company.
被一所主流建筑公司收购

130
00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:50.505
Tragically, after 40 generations of very careful stewardship by the Kongō family,
可悲的是，在 Kongō家族40代的苦心经营之后

131
00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:59.309
Kongō Gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence.
Kongō Gumi最终屈服于在精准运营上的巨大失败

132
00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:01.864
Speaking of company failures:
讲到公司倒闭

133
00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:06.087
we're all familiar with the failure of Kodak,
我们都熟悉柯达公司的失败

134
00:08:06.728 --> 00:08:10.939
the company that declared bankruptcy in January 2012.
柯达在2012年一月宣布破产

135
00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:17.081
Much more interesting, however, is the question:
然而更为有趣的是:

136
00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:18.726
Why did Fujifilm --
为什么富士胶片

137
00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:24.725
same product, same pressures from digital technology, same time --
——同样的产品，相同的数码科技界的压力同样的时间段——

138
00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:28.455
why was Fujifilm able to survive and flourish?
为什么富士胶片能够存活下来并且欣欣向荣？

139
00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:36.637
Fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry, material science and optics
富士胶片运用了自己在化学，材料科学和光学上的造诣

140
00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:40.133
to diversify into a number of areas,
将自己的涉及领域多样化

141
00:08:40.773 --> 00:08:43.821
ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,
从化妆品到医药

142
00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:45.831
to medical systems to biomaterials.
到医学系统、到生物材料

143
00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.540
Some of these diversification attempts failed.
有一些多样化的尝试失败了

made business far more dynamic and unpredictable.

Sounds a little impractical, a little theoretical, perhaps?

naturally thinks and acts biologically.

00:13:50.224 --> 00:13:51.375
Why?

234
00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:55.347
Because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force.

It lacks the scale to buffer change,

for a start-up to survive.

that every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company.

240
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.051

many have lost this ability to think and act biologically.

245
00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:34.775
Every company I know spends plenty of time

00:14:39.622 --> 00:14:41.964
In addition, let's also consider

00:14:41.988 --> 00:14:46.049
the second, more biological and equally important question:
第二个，更为生物化而且同等重要的问题：

250
00:14:46.073 --> 00:14:48.479
How long will that game last?
我们还能坚持多久？

251
00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:50.082
Thank you very much.
