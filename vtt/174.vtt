00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:14.367
It's 2008,

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:17.891
and I'm just finishing my first year of design school.
我刚刚完成 设计学院第一年的课程。

3
00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:21.751
And I'm at my first year-end review,
第一学年末的评审正在进行，

4
00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:28.642
which is a form of ritual torture for design students,
这几乎算是每个 学设计的学生的噩梦，

5
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.389
where they make you take everything you made over the course of the year
因为需要你把 这一年课程中所有的作品

6
00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:34.753
and lay it out on a table
摆在桌上，

7
00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:37.638
and stand next to it while a bunch of professors,
你站在桌边，一群教授，

8
00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.383
most of whom you've never seen before,
他们中的大部分你可能都没见过，

9
00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.026
give you their unfiltered opinions of it.
会直接给出他们的意见。

10
00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.710
So it's my turn and I'm standing next to my table,
轮到我了，我站在自己的桌子旁，

11
00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.530
everything neatly lined up,

12
00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:54.354
and I'm just hoping that my professors can see

13
00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:59.951
how much effort I've put into making my designs practical

and ergonomic and sustainable.

15
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.110
And I'm starting to get really nervous,

16
00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:10.425
because for a long time, no one says anything.

17
00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:12.400
It's just completely silent.
一片寂静。

18
00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:15.767
And then one of the professors starts to speak, and he says,

19
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.268
"Your work gives me a feeling of joy."
“你的作品让我感到快乐。”

20
00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:20.377
Joy?
快乐？

21
00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:24.670
I wanted to be a designer because I wanted to solve real problems.
我做设计师是为了解决真正的问题。

22
00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:29.052
Joy is nice, I guess, but it's kind of light --
快乐算是不错的评价吧， 但是没什么分量……

23
00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:30.515
not substantial.
不是那么实在。

24
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:33.313
But I was also kind of intrigued,
但我也觉得好奇，

25
00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:37.824
because joy is this intangible feeling,
因为快乐是一种无形的感受，

26
00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:41.399
and how does that come from the stuff on the table next to me?
为什么我桌子上的东西 会带来这种感觉呢？

27
00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:43.506
I asked the professors,
我问教授，

28
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.939
"How do things make us feel joy?

29
00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:50.926
How do tangible things make us feel intangible joy?"
有形的事物怎么会 让我们感受到无形的快乐呢？”

30
00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:56.310
They hemmed and hawed and gestured a lot with their hands.
他们嘀嘀咕咕， 挥舞双手比划了半天，

31
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.602
"They just do," they said.

32
00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:01.555
I packed up my things for the summer,

33
00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.731
but I couldn't stop thinking about this question ...
但还是忍不住在想这个问题，

34
00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:07.396
and this launched a journey --
它也让我开始了一段旅程——

35
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.552
one that I didn't know at the time would take me 10 years --

36
00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:14.039
to understand the relationship between the physical world
我想去理解物理世界 和这神秘而虚幻的，

37
00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:19.043
and the mysterious, quixotic emotion we call "joy."
我们称之为“快乐”的情感 到底有什么关系。

38
00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:23.957
And what I discovered is that not only are they linked,
我发现，它们之间不仅有联系，

39
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:27.615
but that the physical world can be a powerful resource to us
而且物理世界对我们来说，

40
00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.244
in creating happier, healthier lives.
可以成为打造更快乐， 更健康生活的有利资源。

41
00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:33.361
After my review,
在那次评审过后，

42
00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.858
I thought, "I know what joy feels like,
我在想，“我知道快乐是什么感觉，

43
00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:38.191
but what is it, exactly?"
但快乐到底是什么呢？”

44
00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:41.964
And I found that even scientists don't always agree,
我发现就连科学家 也得不出一致的结论，

45
00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:45.463
and they sometimes use the words "joy" and "happiness" and "positivity"
他们有时候会将“快乐” “幸福”和“乐观”这几个词

46
00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:47.281
more or less interchangeably.
互换着来用。

47
00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.698
But broadly speaking, when psychologists use the word joy,
但大体上来说，当心理学家 使用快乐这个词的时候，

48
00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:55.127
what they mean is an intense, momentary experience
他们所指的是一种强烈却短暂的，

49
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:56.594
of positive emotion --
乐观的情绪过程，

50
00:02:56.618 --> 00:03:00.615
one that makes us smile and laugh and feel like we want to jump up and down.
会让我们微笑、大笑， 兴奋得想要跳起来。

51
00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.831
And this is actually a technical thing.

52
00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:04.856
That feeling of wanting to jump up and down

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.141
is one of the ways that scientists measure joy.

54
00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:10.825
It's different than happiness,

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.484
which measures how good we feel over time.
幸福是一种更加长久的感觉。

56
00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:16.492

57
00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:17.666
right now.
是当下的感觉。

58
00:03:18.827 --> 00:03:20.301
And this was interesting to me
这一点让我很感兴趣，

59
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.843
because as a culture, we are obsessed with the pursuit of happiness,
因为作为一种文化， 我们总是痴迷于追求幸福，

60
00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:27.727
and yet in the process, we kind of overlook joy.
然而在这个过程中， 我们往往忽略了快乐。

61
00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:33.724
So this got me thinking:
这不禁让我思考：

62
00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:35.686
Where does joy come from?

I started asking everyone I knew,

00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:41.155
and even people I just met on the street,

about the things that brought them joy.

On the subway, in a café, on an airplane,

I felt like a detective.

69
00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:54.612
I was like, "When did you last see it?

Who were you with? What color was it?

I was the Nancy Drew of joy.

73
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:01.601
(Laughter)
（笑声）

And after a few months of this, I noticed that there were certain things

that started to come up again and again and again.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.369
(Laughter)
（笑声）

81
00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:27.498
and ice cream cones, especially the ones with the sprinkles.
还有冰淇淋甜筒， 尤其是上面撒了糖豆的那种。

82
00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:33.857
These things seemed to cut across lines of age and gender and ethnicity.

83
00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:35.840
I mean, if you think about it,

we all stop and turn our heads to the sky

when the multicolored arc of a rainbow streaks across it.

it gave me this indescribably hopeful feeling.

100
00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.681
in fact, they're really important,

because they remind us of the shared humanity we find

in our common experience of the physical world.

But I still needed to know:

What is it about these things that makes them so joyful?

I had pictures of them up on my studio wall,
我把这些照片挂在工作室的墙上，

When I saw it this way,

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:22.402
I realized that though the feeling of joy is mysterious and elusive,

116

we can access it through tangible, physical attributes,

117
00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:28.582
or what designers call aesthetics,

a word that comes from the same root as the Greek word "aísthomai,"
这个词来源于希腊语的 同根词“aisthomai”，

120
00:06:37.488 --> 00:06:41.939
And since these patterns were telling me that joy begins with the senses,

121
00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:44.806
I began calling them "Aesthetics of Joy";

the sensations of joy.

I noticed something that as I walked around,

I began spotting little moments of joy everywhere I went --

I was seeing it everywhere.

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:13.014
It was like these little moments of joy were hidden in plain sight.
这些快乐的小瞬间 就藏在我们眼皮底下。

132
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.268
And at the same time,
与此同时，

133
00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:17.625
I had another realization,
我还发现，

134
00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:20.698
that if these are the things that bring us joy,
如果刚刚提到的这些东西 能带给我们快乐，

135
00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:23.197
then why does so much of the world look like this?

136
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:24.850

141
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:41.039
that are most vulnerable among us:

How did we end up in a world that looks like this?

147
00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:56.890
We all start out joyful,
我们小时候都非常快乐，

148
00:07:56.914 --> 00:08:00.488
but as we get older,
但随着年龄的增长，

149
00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:05.025
being colorful or exuberant opens us up to judgment.
太过色彩绚丽或者热情洋溢 会让我们遭受非议。

150
00:08:05.703 --> 00:08:10.878
Adults who exhibit genuine joy are often dismissed as childish
成年人如果展现出纯粹的快乐， 经常就会被误解为孩子气，

151
00:08:10.902 --> 00:08:12.962
or too feminine

152
00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:15.148

or self-indulgent,

154
00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:21.554
and so we hold ourselves back from joy,
于是我们开始远离快乐，

155
00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:24.161
and we end up in a world that looks like this.
于是我们的世界 就变成了这个样子。

156
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:27.662
But if the aesthetics of joy can be used

to help us find more joy in the world around us,

then couldn't they also be used to create more joy?

159
00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:35.791
I spent that last two years scouring the planet,

160
00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:39.774
looking for different ways that people have answered this question.
寻找不同的人来回答这个问题。

161
00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.052
And this led me to the work of the artist Arakawa

162
00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:44.807
and the poet Madeline Gins,
还有诗人玛德琳 · 基恩斯，

163
00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:49.623
who believed that these kinds of environments are literally killing us.
他们认为这样的环境正在毁灭我们。

164
00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:54.339
And so they set out the create an apartment building

165
00:08:54.363 --> 00:08:56.878
that they believed would reverse aging.

166
00:08:58.133 --> 00:08:59.303
And this is it.
它长这样。

167
00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:03.061
(Laughter)

(Applause)
（掌声）

169
00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:09.571
It's a real place, just outside Tokyo.

I spent a night there, and it's a lot.

00:09:13.246 --> 00:09:15.945
(Laughter)
（笑声）

172
00:09:15.969 --> 00:09:17.706
The floors undulate,
地板是起伏不平的，

173
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.995
so you don't end up walking around
因此你无法在屋子里正常行走，

174
00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:22.521
so much as kind of bouncing around the apartment,
只能跌跌撞撞地前进，

175
00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.777
and there are bright colors in every direction.
到处是明亮的色彩。

176
00:09:28.085 --> 00:09:30.422
I'm not sure I left any younger,
我不知道离开的时候 有没有变年轻一点，

177
00:09:30.446 --> 00:09:34.650
but it's as if, by trying to create an apartment

178
00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.746

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.100
they ended up creating one that was joyful.

180
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.629
And yes, this is a bit much for everyday life,
当然，如果每天都这样， 会有点吃不消，

181
00:09:43.653 --> 00:09:47.059
but it made me wonder: What about the rest of us?
但是这让我思考： 我们其他人该怎么办呢？

182
00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:51.494
How do we bring these ideas back into the real world?

183
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:55.129
So I started finding people who were doing just that.
于是我开始寻找 那些在做同样事情的人。

184
00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:59.763
For example, this hospital, designed by the Danish artist Poul Gernes.
比如这家医院， 是丹麦画家波尔 · 杰恩斯设计的。

185
00:10:00.494 --> 00:10:01.974
Or these schools,

186
00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:04.446
transformed by the non-profit Publicolor.
由非盈利机构“公众色彩”改造。

187
00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:08.554
What's interesting is that Publicolor has heard from school administrators

188
00:10:08.578 --> 00:10:11.708
who say that attendance improves,
说出勤率上升了，

189
00:10:11.732 --> 00:10:13.608

00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:17.373
and kids actually say they feel safer in these painted schools.

191
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.907
And this aligns with research conducted in four countries,

192
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:24.558
which shows that people working in more colorful offices

196
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.032
Why would this be the case?

197
00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:38.047
Well, as I started to trace back our love of color,

198
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:42.373
I found that some researchers see a connection to our evolution.
我发现，有些研究者认为 这跟我们的进化有关。

199
00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:48.383
Color, in a very primal way, is a sign of life, a sign of energy.
颜色，从最原始的角度来看， 象征着生命和活力。

200
00:10:48.883 --> 00:10:50.912
And the same is true of abundance.

201
00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:54.286
We evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous,
在我们生存的世界，匮乏是危险的，

202
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.995
and abundance meant survival.

203
00:10:57.911 --> 00:11:01.134
So, one confetto --

204
00:11:01.158 --> 00:11:03.388
which happens to be the singular of confetti,

in case you were wondering --

206
00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.198
(Laughter)
（笑声）

207

isn't very joyful,

208
00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:09.730

The architect Emmanuelle Moureaux uses this idea in her work a lot.
建筑师爱玛努埃勒 · 穆罗 在很多作品中运用了这一点。

And what about all those round things I noticed?
关于圆形的东西， 我有什么发现呢？

215
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:32.271
Well, it turns out neuroscientists have studied this, too.
神经学家已经做过研究。

216
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:34.716
They put people into fMRI machines,
他们把人放进功能性磁共振成像机，

217
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.087
and they showed them pictures of angular objects and round ones.
分别给他们看带尖角的 和圆形的物体。

218
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:42.237
And what they found is that the amygdala,

219
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:45.887
a part of the brain associated in part with fear and anxiety,

lit up when people looked at angular objects,

221
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.124
but not when they looked at the round ones.
而看向圆形物体的时候则没有。

222
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.650
They speculate that because angles in nature

are often associated with objects that might be dangerous to us,

224
00:11:58.231 --> 00:12:03.246
that we evolved an unconscious sense of caution around these shapes,
于是看到尖锐的物体， 我们会下意识地变得警觉，

225
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.865
whereas curves set us at ease.
而曲线会让我们放松。

226
00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:10.333
You can see this in action in the new Sandy Hook Elementary School.

227
00:12:11.077 --> 00:12:13.080
After the mass shooting there in 2012,

the architects Svigals + Partners

knew that they needed to create a building that was secure,

but they wanted to create one that was joyful,

231
00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:22.348
and so they filled it with curves.

232
00:12:22.372 --> 00:12:25.213
There are waves running along the side of the building,

233

and these squiggly canopies over the entryway,

Each moment of joy is small,

238
00:12:44.373 --> 00:12:47.712
