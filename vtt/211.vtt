136
00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:13.203
that doing this might actually affect their attention.

137
00:07:13.227 --> 00:07:14.849
And that's indeed what we found.

138
00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:18.032
If we present stressful images while they're doing this experiment.
[AI] 如果我们在他们做这个实验的时候展示有压力的图片。

139
00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:21.707
this gap of attention shrinks. its power diminishes.
[AI] 这种注意力差距缩小了。它的力量减弱了。

140
00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:26.193
So in some of our other studies. we wanted to see. OK. great --
[AI] 所以在我们的其他一些研究中。我们想看看。好啊伟大的--

141
00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:29.360
not great. actually. bad news that stress does this to the brain --
[AI] 不太好。事实上坏消息是压力会对大脑产生影响--

142
00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:33.389
but if it is the case that stress has this powerful influence on attention

147
00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.747
we had to basically come up with an experiment

148
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.294
in which we could have people generate their own mind-wandering.

149
00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:48.143

while we're engaged in an ongoing task of some sort.

151
00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:56.391

[AI] 从本质上讲，让人走神的诀窍就是这样。你让人厌烦。

152
00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:58.419
So hopefully there's not a lot of

162
00:08:18.073 --> 00:08:21.423
Well. one trick was that sometimes. the face would be upside down.

163
00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:23.289
and it would happen very infrequently.

164
00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:26.209
On those trials they were told just to withhold the response.
[AI] 在这些试验中，他们被告知不要做出反应。

165
00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:29.858

[AI] 很快。我们可以看出，他们成功地实现了心灵漫游。

166

[AI] 尽管很明显它是颠倒的。

173
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:50.753
also shrinks the gap of attention.

176
00:08:56.715 --> 00:08:59.327
They tell us that attention is very powerful
