Today, I'd like to talk with you

2
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.996
about something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.940
But, unfortunately, it's become incredibly controversial.
但很不幸， 这个话题现在变得饱受争议。

4
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.592
This year, if you think about it,
想想看，就在今年，

5
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.740
over a billion couples will have sex with one another.
有超过十亿对伴侣发生性关系。

6
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.660
Couples like this one,
比如这对，

7
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.220
and this one,
还有这对，

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.236
and this one,
这对，

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.460

even this one.

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.036
(Laughter)
（大笑）

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.620
And my idea is this --
而我是这样想的——

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.996
all these men and women should be free to decide
所有这些男男女女都应该自由决定

14
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.700
whether they do or do not want to conceive a child.
他们是否愿意生育子女。

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.956
And they should be able to use one of these birth control methods

16
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.260
to act on their decision.
使用某种避孕方法。

17
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.716
Now, I think you'd have a hard time
现在应该已经很难找到

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.100
finding many people who disagree with this idea.
很多不同意这个观点的人了。

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.060
Over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all.

20
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.780
They want the power to plan their own lives

and to raise healthier, better educated and more prosperous families.
想要营造一个更健康、教育程度更高、 更富裕的家庭。

22
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.380
But, for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private,
然而，避孕这么一个在私底下 被广泛接受的想法，

23
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.540
birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public.
在公开场合却遭到了诸多反对。

24
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.756
Some people think when we talk about contraception
有些人觉得当我们谈论避孕时，

25
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.300
that it's code for abortion,

26
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.060
which it's not.

Some people -- let's be honest --
坦白地说，有些人

28
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.220
they're uncomfortable with the topic because it's about sex.
对这个话题感到不自在， 因为它和性有关。

29
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.876
Some people worry

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.260
that the real goal of family planning is to control populations.

31
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.356
These are all side issues

32
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.156
that have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women
男女各方应该自由决定 什么时候要孩子

33
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.900
should be able to decide when they want to have a child.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.636
And as a result, birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared

35
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.260
from the global health agenda.

36
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.316

and South Asia.

38
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.236
Here in Germany, the proportion of people that use contraception

39
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.996
is about 66 percent.

40
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.140
That's about what you'd expect.
应该跟各位预期的差不多。

41
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.180
In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.

Thailand, 64 percent.
在泰国，是64%

43
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.596
But let's compare that to other places,
但把这个数字和其他地方比较一下，

44
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.316
like Uttar Pradesh, one of the largest states in India.
比如北方邦，印度最大的邦（省）之一。

45
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.116
In fact, if Uttar Pradesh was its own country,

46
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.620
it would be the fifth largest country in the world.
它会成为世界上人口数量 第五大的国家。

47
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.180
Their contraception rate -- 29 percent.
那里避孕率只有29%。

48
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.660
Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, 10 percent.

50
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.596
Let's just take one country in Africa, Senegal.
我们来看看非洲的一个国家， 塞内加尔。

51
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.676
Their rate is about 12 percent.

52
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.500
But why is it so low?
为什么会这么低？

53
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.700
One reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available.
其中一个原因是最常用的避孕工具 在那里都很难获得。

54
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.276
Women in Africa will tell you over and over again
非洲的女性会一次又一次地告诉你，

55
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.396
that what they prefer today is an injectable.

56
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.436
They get it in their arm -- and they go about four times a year,
（把避孕药物）注射在手臂上， 一年四次。

57
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.516
they have to get it every three months -- to get their injection.
每三个月就要去注射一次。

58
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.820
The reason women like it so much in Africa is they can hide it from their husbands,
非洲女人喜欢这种方法， 是因为这样可以瞒着丈夫，

59

who sometimes want a lot of children.

60
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.596
The problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,

61
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.380
that injection is stocked out.
注射剂都处于断货状态。

It's stocked out 150 days out of the year.

63
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.076

she walks all this way to go get her injection.

and it's not there.

67
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.462
And she doesn't know when it's going to be available again.

68
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.140
This is the same story across the continent of Africa today.
今天，整个非洲大陆都是这样的情况。

69
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.315
And so what we've created as a world has become a life-and-death crisis.
因此，我们在当今世界上创造了一个 出生和死亡的危机。

然后她们却死于分娩—— 整整10万名女性，每一年。

who say they didn't want to be pregnant in the first place,

74
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.276
and they give birth to a baby

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.500
and her baby dies in that first month of life.

I know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children.

77
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.436
But somewhere along the way, we got confused by our own conversation.

78
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.500
And we stopped trying to save these lives.

79
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.820
So if we're going to make progress on this issue,

80
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.980
we have to be really clear about what our agenda is.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.956
What I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives,

things like fight diseases.

We also need to help small farmers --

they use these tools during their life.

there's a global movement waiting to happen

"Even though you've had this great education,
"虽然你接受了良好的教育，

141
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.740
if you decide to get married and have kids right away,
但如果你决定马上结婚生子，

142
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.060
that's OK by us, too."
我们都会支持你的。"

143
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.156
They wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest.
他们希望我能做令我最开心的事情。

144
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.116
I was free to decide what that would be.
我有自己做决定的自由。

145
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.300
It was an amazing feeling.

146
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.396
In fact, I did want to have kids --
其实，我确实想要孩子——

147
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.660
but I wanted to have them when I was ready.
但我想在做好准备的情况下再去生。

148
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.900
And so now, Bill and I have three.
现在，我和比尔拥有三个孩子。

149
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.020
And when our eldest daughter was born,
当我们的长女出生时，

150
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.476
we weren't, I would say, exactly sure how to be great parents.
我们不确定如何当好父母。

151
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.460
Maybe some of you know that feeling.
可能你们当中会有人明白那种感觉。

152
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.140
And so we waited a little while before we had our second child.
于是，我们隔了一段日子 才生下第二个孩子。

153
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.516
And it's no accident that we have three children
我们三个孩子的出生都隔了三年的时间，

154
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.780
that are spaced three years apart.
这并不难理解。

155
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.300
Now, as a mother, what do I want the very most for my children?
身为母亲， 我对孩子最大的期望是什么呢？

156
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.540
I want them to feel the way I did --
我希望他们会和当年的我 有同样的感受——

157
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.020
like they can do anything they want to do in life.
比如他们一生都可以做 所有自己想做的事。

158
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.476
And so, what has struck me
过去的十年里，

159
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.500
as I've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world
我为了基金会的事情走遍了世界，

160
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.060
is that all women want that same thing.
发现所有女性也都想要这样的生活。

161
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.276
Last year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums, in one called Korogocho --
去年，我拜访了内罗毕（非洲）的 一个叫科罗戈乔的贫民窟——

162
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.860
which literally means when translated, "standing shoulder to shoulder."
地名直译的意思是"肩并肩地站着"。

163
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.716
And I spoke with this women's group that's pictured here.

164

And the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums,

166
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.940
And they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control.

167
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.876

she summed up that entire two-hour conversation

169
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.980
in a phrase that I will never forget.

170
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:59.420
She said, "I want to bring every good thing to this child

171
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.740
before I have another."

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.660
That's universal.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.660
We all want to bring every good thing to our children.

175
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.100
But what's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing.
但不是所有人都有能力 为孩子提供最好的。

176
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.476
So many women suffer from domestic violence.
很多女人都遭受家庭暴力。

177
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.556
And they can't even broach the subject of contraception,

178
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.420
even inside their own marriage.

There are many women who lack basic education.

don't have access to contraceptives.

have been deciding to have smaller families.

185
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.820
across cultures and across geographies,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:00.100
with the glaring exception of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
除了南非洲和南亚地区以外。

在18世纪中期， 法国人就开始减小家庭规模。

在接下来的150年里， 这个趋势蔓延到了整个欧洲。

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.396
The surprising thing to me, as I learned this history,
我在学习这段历史的时候， 令我惊讶的是，

190
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:23.236
was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines.
导致这种趋势蔓延的并不是 社会科学的考量，而是文化的考量。

191
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.116
People who spoke the same language made that change as a group.

whether they were rich or whether they were poor.

194
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.436
The reason that trend toward smaller families spread
倾向小家庭的趋势之所以会蔓延，

195
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.660
was that this whole way was driven by an idea --

196
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.156
the idea that couples can exercise conscious control

over how many children they have.

It means that parents have the ability to affect the future,

not just accept it as it is.

过渡期如此之长主要是因为 那时侯的避孕方式效果并不好。

在德国，这个趋势在19世纪末 就已经开始了，仅仅五十年的时间

for family size to stabilize in this country.

亚洲和拉美的过渡期发生在1960年代，

207
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.700

因为有了现代的避孕法， 过渡期更短了。

208
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.796
I think, as we go through this history, it's important to pause for a moment
但我认为，在我们回顾这短历史的时候， 应该停下来想想，

209
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.876
and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue.
这个话题为什么如此惹争议。

210
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.556

比如，在1960年代， 印度制定了很具体的数字指标，

and they paid women to accept having an IUD placed in their bodies.

Now, Indian women were really smart in this situation.

They waited a few hours or a few days,

it became known as the Mississippi appendectomy --

a tragic chapter in my country's history.

227

The most startling thing about this

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.396
is that these coercive policies weren't even needed.

where parents already wanted to lower their family size.

parents have wanted to have smaller families.

that African women have innately different desires.

236
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.396
The question is:

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.900
will we invest in helping all women get what they want now?
我们会竭尽所能帮助 全体女性争取她们的权利吗？

as if this was still revolutionary France

is a force for good throughout the world.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.356
In that same slum in Nairobi, I met a young businesswoman,
