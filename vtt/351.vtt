1
00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.717
Design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon,
设计是一件难以定义，难以描述的事。

2
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.002
which has meant different things at different times.
在不同时期，它的意义也不同。

3
00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:23.294
But all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common:
但所有真正有启发性的设计作品都有一个共同点：

4
00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:25.144
they began with a dream.
它们始于一个梦想。

5
00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:26.937
And the bolder the dream,
梦想越是宏远，

6
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.602
the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it.
所需要的设计技艺就越大胆

7
00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:34.520
And this is why the greatest designers are almost always
而这就是为什么最伟大的设计师总是

8
00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:38.232
the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades.
最大的梦想家、叛逆者和革新者。

9
00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:41.390
This has been the case throughout history,
这样的例子在历史中比比皆是。

10
00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:45.335
all the way back to the year 300 BC,
300 公元前，

11
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:52.945
when a 13-year-old became the king of a remote, very poor and very small Asian country.
一个十三岁的孩子成为了一个偏僻贫穷的亚洲小国家的君主。

12
00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:58.471
He dreamt of acquiring land, riches and power through military conquest.
他梦想通过武力征服得到土地，财富和权利。

13
00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:04.794
And his design skills -- improbable though it sounds -- would be essential in enabling him to do so.
而他的设计能力对他实现梦想必不可少，尽管这听起来不可能。

14
00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:06.575
At the time,
那时，

15
00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.009
all weapons were made by hand to different specifications.
所有武器都是手工制造以至于规格都不同，

16
00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:13.339
So if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle,
所以当一个弓箭手在一场战争中射完了所有的箭，

17
00:01:13.363 --> 00:01:19.158
they wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows from their bow.
他们不一定能用自己的弓射出其他弓箭手的箭。

18
00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:22.743
This of course meant that they would be less effective in combat
这自然意味着他们在战斗中将缺乏战斗力，

19
00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.671
and very vulnerable, too.
也很容易受伤。

20
00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.761
Ying solved this problem
嬴解决了这个问题。

21
00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:30.876
by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically,
他坚持所有弓和箭都要设计得一模一样，

22
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.631
so they were interchangeable.
这样它们就能被交换使用。

23
00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:36.657
And he did the same for daggers, axes, spears, shields
他也统一了短剑，战斧，矛，盾

24
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.166
and every other form of weaponry.
及其它各种形式的武器。

25
00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:43.728
His formidably equipped army won batter after battle,
他武装精良的军队打赢了一场场战斗。

26
00:01:43.752 --> 00:01:45.542
and within 15 years,
在15年里，

27
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:51.573
his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger, richer, more powerful neighbors,
他的小国家成功攻占了所有更广阔，更富饶，更强大的邻国，

28
00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:54.120
to found the mighty Chinese Empire.
成为了强大的秦（中国）帝国。

29
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.390
Now, no one, of course,
如今，当然没有人

30
00:01:56.414 --> 00:02:00.192
would have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time --
会想到把嬴政描述成那时的设计家——

31
00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:01.424
why would they?
他们为什么会呢？

32
00:02:01.448 --> 00:02:05.251
And yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively
但是赢在不知不觉中本能地

33
00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:09.427
but with tremendous ingenuity to achieve his ends.
运用了非常巧妙的设计实现了他的目标。

34
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:13.991
And so did another equally improbable, accidental designer,
还有另一个听起来不可能，却偶然造就的设计家。

35
00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:17.770
who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted.
他也是用武力得到了他想要的。

36
00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:23.456
This was Edward Teach, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard.
他就是爱德华·蒂奇，作为英国海盗以黑胡子闻名。

37
00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:26.097
This was the golden age of piracy,
这是海盗的黄金时代，

38
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.794
where pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas.
海盗威慑公海。

39
00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:31.787
Colonial trade was flourishing,
那时殖民贸易繁荣，

40
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:34.072
and piracy was highly profitable.
海上劫掠很是有利可图。

41
00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:38.935
And the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils,
像蒂奇这样更加聪明的海盗意识到，为使利益最大化，

42
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.586
they needed to attack their enemies so brutally
他们要残忍地攻击敌人，

43
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.403
that they would surrender on sight.
以使敌人一见到他们就投降。

44
00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:46.578
So in other words,
也就是说，

45
00:02:46.602 --> 00:02:49.148
they could take the ships without wasting ammunition,
他们可以不费一枪一弹，

46
00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:51.213
or incurring casualties.
不伤一兵一卒地夺取船只。

47
00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.902
So Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard
所以爱德华·蒂奇变得残忍无情，

48
00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:57.178
by playing the part of a merciless brute.
重塑自己成为了黑胡子。

49
00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:01.639
He wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height.
他穿沉重的外套，戴很大的帽子以突显他的身高。

50
00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:05.158
He grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face.
他留浓密的黑胡子以模糊他的面容。

51
00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:08.729
He slung braces of pistols on either shoulder.
他把手枪背带搭在肩上。

52
00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:12.651
He even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight,
他甚至把点燃的火绳系在帽檐上，

53
00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:16.805
so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack.
这样在海盗们准备攻击时，火绳就会威胁着咝咝作响。

54
00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.401
And like many pirates of that era,
就像那个时代的很多海盗一样，

55
00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:22.314
he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols
他在船上挂一面印有可怕标志的旗，

56
00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:25.798
of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones,
旗上有人的骷髅头骨和一对交叉着的骨头，

57
00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:31.513
because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries,
这些图案几百年来在很多文化中都代表着死亡，

58
00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:34.399
that their meaning was instantly recognizable,
所以即使是在公海这没有法制，没有文化的世界，

59
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:37.963
even in the lawless, illiterate world of the high seas:
它们的含义立刻就能被理解：

60
00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:40.463
surrender or you'll suffer.
投降，否则你会受到惩罚。

61
00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.742
So of course, all his sensible victims surrendered on sight.
因此，那些明智的受害者一看到他就投降了。

62
00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:45.796
Put like that,
这样看的话，

63
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.495
it's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates
就很容易理解为什么爱德华·蒂奇和他的海盗朋友们

64
00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.994
could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design,
能被当作现代传播学的设计先驱，

65
00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:56.942
and why their deadly symbol --
以及为什么他们的死亡标志

66
00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:58.028
(Laughter)
（笑声）

67
00:03:58.052 --> 00:03:59.203
there's more --
还有——

68
00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:02.212
why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones
为什么他们头骨和交叉骨头的死亡标志

69
00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:04.526
was a precursor of today's logos,
会成为现今标识的前身，

70
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.897
rather like the big red letters standing behind me,
而不是我身后立着的大的红色字母。

71
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.100
but of course with a different message.
当然，这些字母传播着不同的信息。

72
00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:11.128
(Laughter)
（笑声）

73
00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:14.162
Yet design was also used to nobler ends
设计也被一个同样聪慧，同样看似不可能的设计家

74
00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:18.400
by an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer,
用于更加崇高的目标，

75
00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:22.260
the 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale.
她就是十九世纪的英国护士，弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔。

76
00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:26.603
Her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone.
她以为所有人提供良好的医疗护理为使命。

77
00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:31.603
Nightingale was born into a rather grand, very wealthy British family,
南丁格尔生于英国的一个名门富有之家，

78
00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:35.668
who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals
当她志愿在克里米亚战争中的军医院工作时，

79
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.326
during the Crimean War.
她的家人都感到震惊。

80
00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:40.112
Once there, she swiftly realized
一到战地医院，她很快意识到

81
00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:43.749
that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there,
很多病人不是死于战争受伤，

82
00:04:42.353 --> 00:04:47.541
in the filthy, fetid wards, than they were of battle wounds.
而是死于在肮脏恶臭的病房中的感染。

83
00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:53.608
So she campaigned for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics to be designed and built.
所以她主张设计和建造更干净、更明亮、更通风的诊所。

84
00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:55.394
Back in Britain,
回到英国后，

85
00:04:55.418 --> 00:04:56.908
she mounted another campaign,
她发起了又一次运动，

86
00:04:56.932 --> 00:04:58.990
this time for civilian hospitals,
这一次是为了建立平民医院，

87
00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.887
and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them.
并坚持使用同样的设计准则。

88
00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:06.068
The Nightingale ward, as it is called,
这所南丁格尔医院

89
00:05:06.092 --> 00:05:09.772
dominated hospital design for decades to come,
几世纪来都对医院设计起了决定性影响，

90
00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:12.838
and elements of it are still used today.
一些原理沿用至今。

91
00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:14.909
But by then,
但是从那以后，

92
00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:17.961
design was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age.
设计就被当作工业时代的一种工具。

93
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.711
It was formalized and professionalized,
它变得正式和专业，

94
00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:23.228
but it was restricted to specific roles
但也受到了局限，

95
00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:26.330
and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals
它被普遍地用于商业追求，

96
00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:28.629
rather than being used intuitively,
而不是被自然地使用，

97
00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:32.879
as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done.
就像被弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔，黑胡子，和嬴政的做法一样。

98
00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.702
By the 20th century,
到二十世纪，

99
00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:37.739
this commercial ethos was so powerful,
这种商业思维非常强大

100
00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:40.287
that any designers who deviated from it
以至于任何背离了它的设计家

101
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:43.918
risked being seen as cranks or subversives.
都冒着被看作怪人或颠覆者的危险。

102
00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:48.174
Now among them is one of my great design heroes,
他们中有一个我崇拜的伟大设计家，

103
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.726
the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.
杰出的拉兹洛·莫霍利·纳吉。

104
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.517
He was the Hungarian artist and designer

105
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:58.987
whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life were so powerful
他关于科技对日常生活影响的著名实验

106
00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:05.057
that they still influence the design of the digital images we see on our phone and computer screens.
依然影响着我们在手机和电脑上看到的数字图像设计

107
00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:10.175
He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany,
在二十世纪二十年代的德国，他使包豪斯艺术学院变得激进，

108
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.946
and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him
然而几年后当他在芝加哥努力要建一所新的包豪斯时，

109
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.588
when he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later.
他之前的一些同事都躲着他。

110
00:06:18.014 --> 00:06:22.228
Moholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever,
莫霍利拥有前所未有、大胆敏锐的想法，

111
00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:25.979
but his approach to design was too experimental,
但是他的设计方法太具实验性，

112
00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:29.487
as was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it,
就如他坚持见证他的想法一样，用他的话说，

113
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.810
as an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.
这是一种态度，而不是合时宜的一种表达。

114
00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.455
And sadly, the same applied
遗憾的是，另外一位特立独行的设计者

115
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.963
to another design maverick: Richard Buckminster Fuller.
理查德·巴克敏斯特·富勒也有同样遭遇。

116
00:06:40.987 --> 00:06:46.118
He was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist,

117
00:06:46.142 --> 00:06:50.706
who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society

118
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.610
in such a forward-thinking way
这种设计思维那么具有前瞻性，

119
00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:55.974
that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism
以至于在二十世纪二十年代

120
00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:58.751
in design in the 1920s.
他就开始讨论环境保护在设计中的重要性。

121
00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.905
Now he, despite his efforts,
虽然他如此努力

122
00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:06.662
was routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment,
但他一直被很多人嘲笑为设计领域的怪人。

123
00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:07.854
and admittedly,
诚然，

124
00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:09.671
some of his experiments failed,
他的一些实验失败了，

125
00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.689
like the flying car that never got off the ground.
比如从没有飞起来的飞行汽车。

126
00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:18.109
And yet, the geodesic dome, his design formula to build an emergency shelter
但他用来建造紧急庇护所的设计方案，

127
00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:20.814
from scraps of wood, metal, plastic,
也就是用木片、金属、塑料

128
00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:24.084
bits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting --
小块的树木、旧毯子、塑料薄膜

129
00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:26.855
just about anything that's available at the time --
几乎是那时任何可用的东西

130
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:33.137
is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design, and has provided sorely needed refuge
建成的测量圆屋顶，是最伟大的人道设计之一

131
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:38.254
to many, many people in desperate circumstances ever since.
此后给在绝境中的无数人提供了亟需的庇护。

132
00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:44.180
Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy
如今，巴克和莫霍利这些激进设计家的勇气和热情

133
00:07:44.204 --> 00:07:46.477
that drew me to design.
在吸引我深入设计领域。

134
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:50.537
I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent.
我开始工作时是一个新闻记者和国外通讯记者。

135
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:53.979
I wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs,

136
00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:57.829
and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields.
本可以选择专攻其中的任一领域。

137
00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:59.597
But I picked design,
但是我选择了设计，

138
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:05.772
because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life.
因为我相信它是我们可以使用以提高生活质量的最有力工具之一。

139
00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:10.153
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.
谢谢，同为TED的设计爱好者们。

140
