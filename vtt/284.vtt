1
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.796
So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.
我在佛罗里达州的奥兰多市长大

2
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.116
I was the son of an aerospace engineer.
我是航空工程师的儿子

3
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.876
I lived and breathed the Apollo program.
阿波罗计划与我的生活息息相关

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.956
We either saw the launches from our backyard
我们不是在后院里看着发射器

5
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.636
or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape.
就是开上好几个小时车到开普敦镇去看它

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.518
I was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it,
显然，空间科学对我产生了深刻的影响

7
00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:33.447
but I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it.
但最让我印象深刻的是这背后的工程学

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.236
Behind me you see an amazing view,
你看到的在我身后的壮观景象

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.156
a picture that was taken from the International Space Station,
是一幅从国际空间站拍的图片

10
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.356
and it shows a portion of our planet
它展示了我们星球的一部分

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.796
that's rarely seen and rarely studied
罕见而且极少被研究的一部分

12
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.116
and almost never explored.
几乎从未被探索的一个地方

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.676
That place is called the stratosphere.
这一部分被称为平流层

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.836
If you start on the planet and you go up and up and up,
如果你从地面出发一直往上往上往上

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.436
it gets colder and colder and colder,
周围会变得愈来愈冷

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.836
until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere,
直到你进入平流层

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.476
and then an amazing thing happens.
接下来神奇的事情发生了

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.516
It gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up,
变冷的速度变慢了许多，然后开始暖和起来

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.196
and then it gets warmer and warmer
然后越来越暖和

20
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.156
until the point where you can almost survive without any protection,
直到你几乎不需要任何保护措施也能生存

21
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.996
about zero degrees,
大约到达了零度

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.315
and then you end up getting colder and colder,
接下来你会愈来愈冷愈来愈冷

23
00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:19.556
and that's the top of the stratosphere.
这就是平流层的顶部了

24
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.516
It is one of the least accessible places on our planet.
这是我们这个星球极少有人到达的地方之一

25
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.276
Most often, when it's visited,
大多数情况下，当它被造访时，

26
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.196
it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it
那是宇航员们乘坐着火箭

27
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.076
at probably several times the speed of sound,
以大约是音速数倍的速度穿过它

28
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.076
and they get a few seconds on the way up,
宇航员在上升时停留了几秒钟

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.876
and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in,
还有就是他们返航时，坐着烧成火球的返回舱

30
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.836
on the way back in.
回到地面上

31
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.156
But the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere?
但我想问的问题是，是否有可能在平流层逗留？

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.516
Is it possible to experience the stratosphere?
是否有可能去体验平流层？

33
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.060
Is it possible to explore the stratosphere?
是否有可能去探索平流层？

34
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.236
I studied this using my favorite search engine
我用我最喜欢的搜索引擎来研究这个问题

35
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.276
for quite a while, about a year,
研究了大约有一年

36
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.796
and then I made a scary phone call.
然后我根据一个朋友的参考意见

37
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.516
It was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum
给Taber MacCallum打了一通吓人的电话

38
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.276
from Paragon Space Development Corporation,
他在Paragon空间发展公司工作

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.681
and I asked him the question:
我问了他这个问题：

40
00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:15.065
is it possible to build
有没有可能

41
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.956
a system to go into the stratosphere?
建造一个去平流层的系统？

42
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.556
And he said it was.
他回答说，“可以。”

43
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.276
And after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that.
此后大约过了三年，我们开始着手筹划

44
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.780
And on October 24 of last year,
在去年的十月24号

45
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.700
in this suit,
穿着这套设备

46
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.660
I started on the ground,
我从地面出发

47
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.580
I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --
我在一个气球中上升到离地135,890英尺的高度

48
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.396
but who's counting?
但谁关心数字呢？

49
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.876
(Laughter)
（笑声）

50
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.300
Came back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.
回地球的速度高达822公里每小时

51
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.660
It was a four-minute and 27-second descent.
我下降了四分27秒

52
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.500
And when I got to 10,000 feet, I opened a parachute and I landed.
当我到达10，000英尺，我打开降落伞然后在地面着陆

53
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.500
(Applause)
（鼓掌喝彩）

54
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.876
But this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk,
但这是一次关于科学的演讲，关于工程技术的演讲

55
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.196
and what was amazing to me about that experience
这次体验让我感到不可思议的是

56
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.876
is that Taber said, yes, I think we can build a stratospheric suit,
Taber说，我们可以制作一套适用于平流层的装备，

57
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.516
and more than that, come down tomorrow
不止如此，明天过来

58
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.900
and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it.
让我们和制作出装备的小组的核心人员深入探讨。

59
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.556
And they did something which I think is important,
他们做了一些我认为很重要的事情，

60
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.916
which is they took the analogy of scuba diving.
他们参考了潜水器的设计。

61
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.636
So in scuba diving,
在潜水器里，

62
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.476
you have a self-contained system.
有一个自携装置。

63
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.836
You have everything that you could ever need.
你所需要的一切都有。

64
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.900
You have a scuba tank.
你有一个氧气瓶。

65
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.956
You have a wetsuit.
你有潜水服。

66
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.716
You have visibility.
你有可视装置。

67
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.476
And that scuba is exactly this system,
潜水装置就是我们想要的系统，

68
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.940
and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere.
我们要把一种类似的装置发射到平流层去。

69
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.900
Three years later, this is what we have.
三年研究后，这是我们的改良装置。

70
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.676
We've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover.
ILC Dover为我们制作了一套令人惊叹的服装装置。

71
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.156
ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits
ILC Dover公司提供了阿波罗计划的所有保护套装

72
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.596
and all of the extravehicular activity suits.
和所有外太空活动的保护套装

73
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.876
They had never sold a suit commercially,
他们从来不向私人出售，

74
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.476
only to the government,
只和政府打交道，

75
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.116
but they sold one to me, which I am very grateful for.
但他们向我提供了一套，我对此很是感激。

76
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.300
Up here we have a parachute. This was all about safety.
在这里我们有一个降落伞包。安全起见。

77
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.876
Everyone on the team knew
我们团队里的人都知道

78
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.636
that I have a wife and two small children --
我有妻子和两个很小的孩子 --

79
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.236
10 and 15 --
一个十岁另一个十五岁 ——

80
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.315
and I wanted to come back safely.
我想平安地回来。

81
00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.769
So there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute,
有一个主降落伞包和一个备用降落伞包，

82
00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:32.993
and if I do nothing,
如果我什么都不做（译注：失去意识或行为能力），

83
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.247
the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device.
备用降落伞包将会被自动启用装置打开。

84
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.116
The suit itself can protect me from the cold.
这套保护服会为我御寒。

85
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.076
This area in the front here has thermal protection.
前面的部分有高温保护装置。

86
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.276
It will actually heat water that will wrap around my body.
它会加热环绕我身体的水。

87
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.756
It has two redundant oxygen tanks.
它有两个冗余的氧气瓶。

88
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.836
Even if I was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit,
即使我在这套保护服上弄出一个四分之一英寸的小孔，

89
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.436
which is extremely unlikely,
当然这个几率很小，

90
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.260
this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space.
这套装置依然能在低压环境中保护我。

91
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.796
The main advantage of this system is weight and complexity.
这套系统主要的优点是重量很轻，复杂性相对教低。

92
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.796
So the system weighs about 500 pounds,
整套系统重500磅，

93
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.636
and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere,
如果跟其它穿越平流层的装备比的话，

94
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.916
they used a capsule.
别人使用的是太空舱。

95
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.916
And to do a capsule, there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it,
制作太空舱需要极其复杂的工艺，

96
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.876
and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,
重量约为3000磅，

97
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.596
and to raise 3,000 pounds to an altitude of 135,000 feet,
要让3000磅的装置升到135,000英尺，

98
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.756
which was my target altitude,
那是我的目标高度，

99
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.940
it would have taken a balloon that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.
需要一个4.5到5千万立方英尺的气球。

100
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.996
Because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system,
而整个系统加我在内只有500磅，

101
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.236
we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that,
我们可以用一个小五倍的气球代替，

102
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.676
and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler
这样我们就可以用一个简便多了的发射系统

103
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.340
than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon.
不需要那些大气球需要的复杂装备。

104
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.956
So with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.
现在，我带你们看看10月24日的罗斯威尔市，在新墨西哥州。

105
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.676
We had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night.
我们有一个在深夜工作的伟大的团队。

106
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.276
And here's the suit.
这就是保护服。

107
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.436
Again, this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second,
再次说明，这是用抓钩机吊起来的，你们马上会再见到，

108
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.676
and I want to play you a video of the actual launch.
我想放一段发射现场的视频。

109
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.716
Roswell's a great place to launch balloons,
罗斯威尔是发射气球的好场所，

110
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.916
but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute,
更是一个降落伞降落的绝佳场所，

111
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.340
especially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started.
尤其是你要从70英里的高空降落时。

112
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.500
That's a helium truck in the background.
背景里的是一辆装氢气的卡车。

113
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.436
It's darkness.
天黑了。

114
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.676
I've already spent about an hour and a half pre-breathing.
我已经花了一个半小时调整呼吸。

115
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.100
And then here you see the suit going on.
然后你看到的是装备保护服的过程。

116
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.060
It takes about an hour to get the suit on.
整个过程用了一个小时。

117
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.036
Astronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van
宇航员乘坐空调专车去发射点

118
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.636
to go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader.
但我是被抓钩机吊着送去的。

119
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.836
(Laughter)
（笑声）

120
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.396
You can see the top. You can see the balloon up there.
你可以看见最上面。你可以看见那上面的气球。

121
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.940
That's where the helium is.
里面填充的是氢气。

122
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.100
This is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for 15 miles.
这是Dave和联邦航空管理局在帮我清出来15英里的飞行空间。

123
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.380
And there we go.
现在我们升空了。

124
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.036
(Laughter)
（笑声）

125
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.756
That's me waving with my left hand.
这是我在挥动我的左手。

126
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.836
The reason I'm waving with my left hand
我挥动左手的原因是

127
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.516
is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway.
挥动右手表示紧急刹停。

128
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.116
(Laughter)
（笑声）

129
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.980
My team forbade me from using my right hand.
我的团队禁止我用我的右手。

130
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.436
So the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.
向上的旅途十分美妙。有点像反过来播放的谷歌地图。

131
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.276
(Laughter)
（笑声）

132
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.396
It took two hours and seven minutes to go up,
向上花了两个小时七分钟，

133
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.156
and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes.
那是最平静的两小时七分钟。

134
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.060
I was mostly trying to relax.
大多时间我试着放松。

135
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.756
My heart rate was very low
我的心率极其缓慢

136
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.900
and I was trying not to use very much oxygen.
我尽可能少用氧气。

137
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.396
You can see how the fields in the background
你可以在背景里看到地面建筑

138
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.036
are relatively big at this point,
现在还是相对比较大的，

139
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.116
and you can see me going up and up.
你可以看见我一直在上升。

140
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.156
It's interesting here, because if you look,
这里十分有趣，你看，

141
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.556
I'm right over the airport, and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,
我在机场的正上方，大约50,000英尺高，

142
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.276
but immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind
但马上我就要进入平流层风带

143
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.020
of over 120 miles an hour.
那里风的时速超过120英里。

144
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.996
This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher
这是我的飞行指导员告诉我

145
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.236
than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon,
我比任何用气球上去的人到得更高，

146
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.940
and I was about 4,000 feet from release.
我离自由落体点还有4,000英尺。

147
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.860
This is what it looks like.
终于抵达了最终的高度

148
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.965
You can see the darkness of space, the curvature of the Earth,
你可以看见太空中的暗处，地球的曲线，

149
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.220
the fragile planet below.
底下的脆弱的星球。

150
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.220
I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now.
当时正在脑海中演练紧急情况处理流程。

151
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.476
If anything goes wrong, I want to be ready.
如果有意外发生，我希望能稳妥应对。

152
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.676
And the main thing that I want to do here
在这里的我想做的主要事情是

153
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:35.116
is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable.
稳稳当当地降落在目的地。

154
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.060
(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?
（视频）地面控制台。所有人都准备好了吗？

155
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.780
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
五！四！三！二！一！

156
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.089
Alan Eustace: There's the balloon going by, fully inflated at this point.
现在飘过去的是气球，已经充好气了。

157
00:09:04.498 --> 00:09:08.356
And there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second,
现在你看到的是减速伞，我马上会介绍，

158
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.956
because that's really important.
因为这非常重要。

159
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.980
There's the balloon going by a second time.
这是第二次看到气球

160
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.180
Right now, I'm about at the speed of sound.
现在，我马上要以音速飞行。

161
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.180
There's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound,
我对音速没有什么好描述的，

162
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.476
and very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get,
很快我就到达了所能达到的最高速，

163
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.140
822 miles an hour.
时速822英里。

164
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.973
(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.
（视频）地面控制台：我们的通信中断了

165
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.396
AE: So now I'm down low right now
现在我开始下降了、

166
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.716
and you can basically see the parachute come out right there.
你们能看见降落伞在这边出现。

167
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.502
At this point, I'm very happy that there's a parachute out.
那时，我非常开心降落伞打开了。

168
00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:07.276
I thought I was the only one happy,
我以为我是唯一一个觉得开心的人，

169
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.636
but it turns out mission control was really happy as well.
但我发现任务控制中心也非常开心。

170
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.756
The really nice thing about this is the moment I opened --
最妙的时刻是我打开降落伞时 --

171
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.156
I had a close of friend of mine, Blikkies, my parachute guy.
我的好朋友，Blikkies，我的降落伞教练，

172
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.116
He flew in another airplane, and he actually jumped out
他乘坐另一架飞机，他真的在机上跳下来

173
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.116
and landed right next to me.
然后在我身旁降落。

174
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.396
He was my wingman on the descent.
他是我下降过程的军师。

175
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:30.636
This is my landing, but it's probably more properly called a crash.
这是我的降落过程，更准确的说是撞击地面的过程。

176
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.876
(Laughter)
（笑声）

177
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.356
I hate to admit it, but this wasn't even close to my worst landing.
我非常不愿意承认，这是我最最槽糕的降落。

178
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.236
(Laughter)
（笑声）

179
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.580
(Applause)
（掌声）

180
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.476
(Video) Man: How are you doing?
（视频）男人：你好吗？

181
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.780
AE: Hi there!
AE：你好啊！

182
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.316
Yay.
棒极了。

183
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.636
(Laughter)
（笑声）

184
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.156
So I want to tell you one thing
我想告诉你们一件事情

185
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.476
that you might not have seen in that video,
你可能没有在视频里看过，

186
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.356
but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release
但是整件事情中最重要的部分是刚刚脱离时

187
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.236
and what happens right after you release.
和接下来的十几秒钟。

188
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.556
And what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute,
我们尝试用了降速伞，

189
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.276
and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me.
降速伞是帮助我平稳下降的。

190
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.356
And I'll show you one of those right now.
我马上要给你展示其中一个。

191
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.020
If any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving,
如果你们中有人试过串联跳伞，

192
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.460
you probably used one of these.
你可能用过这个。

193
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.956
But the problem with one of these things
但还有一个问题

194
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.916
is right when you release, you're in zero gravity.
当你自由落体是，你处于零重力。

195
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.556
So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you.
所以这个东西就很容易绕着你打转。

196
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.860
And before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning,
在你反应过来之前，就会被缠住或者打起转来，

197
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.796
or you can release this drogue late,
如果你晚一点打开减速伞，

198
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.876
in which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,
这时候你就会以800英里的时速下降，

199
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.396
and this thing is going to destroy itself
这东西就会自己被破坏

200
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.620
and not be very useful.
变得毫无用处。

201
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.516
But the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea,
但联合降落伞科技的人想出这种办法，

202
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.476
and it was a roll that looks like that,
翻转看起来是这样的，

203
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.180
but watch what happens when I pull it out.
但我把它拉出来以后。

204
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.980
It's forming a pipe.
它形成了一个管道。

205
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.700
This pipe is so solid
这个管道非常坚固

206
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.956
that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around,
让你可以把减速伞包裹在上面，

207
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.300
and there's no way it will ever tangle with you.
它就无法缠扰你了。

208
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.740
And that prevented a very serious potential problem.
这避免了非常危险的潜在问题。

209
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.316
So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people.
当有一个梦幻的团队是没有事情是不可能的。

210
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.796
The core of this was about 20 people
队伍的核心是20个成员

211
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.916
that worked on this for the three years,
他们在这上面花了三年，

212
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.556
and they were incredible.
他们非常了不起。

213
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.356
People asked me what the best part of this whole thing was,
人们问我整件事情最美妙的部分在哪，

214
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.836
and it was a chance to work with the best experts
那是与最好的专业人员共事的

215
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.476
in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology
在气象学，热气球和降落伞科技共事的机会

216
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.956
and environmental systems and high altitude medicine.
还有环境系统和高空用药。

217
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.116
It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people.
那太美妙了。和他们一起共事是每个工程师梦想。

218
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.396
And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google,
同时我想感谢在谷歌的朋友，

219
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.276
both for supporting me during this effort
感谢你们对我努力成果的支持

220
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.596
and also covering for me in the times that I was away.
和在我不在的时间里为我分担。

221
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.916
But there's one other group I wanted to thank, and that's my family.
还有另一个我想致谢的团队，我的家庭。

222
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.156
Yay.
你们真棒。

223
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:19.396
(Applause)
（掌声）

224
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.116
I would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology,
我会持续不断的告诉他们科学的安全性，

225
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.340
and they weren't hearing any of it.
但他们一点也不会听进去。

226
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.276
It was super hard on them,
这对他们来说太难了，

227
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.876
and the only reason that my wife put up with it
我妻子容忍下来的唯一一个原因

228
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.396
was because I came back incredibly happy after each of the 250 tests,
是每次当我完成测试（共250项）测试后回到家都非常开心，

229
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.596
and she didn't want to take that away from me.
她不想让我失去这份快乐。

230
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.396
So I want to close with a story.
我想以一个故事收场。

231
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.996
My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old, she and I were in the car,
我的15岁的女儿Katelyn, 和我在车里，

232
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.476
and we were driving down the road, and she was sitting there,
我们沿着路开，她坐在那

233
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.876
and she had this idea, and she goes, "Dad, I've got this idea."
她想到一个主意，她说，“爸爸，我有一个主意。”

234
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.420
And so I listened to her idea and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."
我听了她的主意然后说，“Katelyn,这是不可能的。”

235
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.756
And she looks at me
她看着我

236
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.116
and she goes, "Dad, after what you just did,
她说，“爸爸，在你做到这件事情之后，

237
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.540
how can you call anything impossible?"
还有什么事情可以被你称作不可能的？“

238
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.836
And I laughed, and I said, "OK, it's not impossible,
我大笑，然后我说，“好的，这不是不可能的，

239
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.260
it's just very, very hard."
只是非常，非常的困难。”

240
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.556
And then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn,
然后我停顿了一秒，接着说，“Katelyn,

241
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.316
it may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard,
或许并不是不可能，甚至也不是难，

242
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.116
it's just that I don't know how to do it."

243
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.356
Thank you.
