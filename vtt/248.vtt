00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.936
This is me building a prototype

2
00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.856
for six hours straight.
足足花了6个小时，

3
00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:21.777
This is slave labor to my own project.
完全是苦力活。

4
00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:26.767
This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.
这就是所谓的自己动手做和自造者运动。

5
00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:31.533
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world
这也是今日全球建筑和制造业的缩影：

6
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.321
with brute-force assembly techniques.
到处可见费尽蛮力的组装技术。

7
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:37.155
And this is exactly why I started studying
这也是我为什么开始研究

8
00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:41.424
how to program physical materials to build themselves.
如何让物理材料根据特定程序来组装自己。

9
00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.184
But there is another world.
但是，还有另外一个世界。

10
00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:45.179
Today at the micro- and nanoscales,
如今在微观纳米级上，

11
00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.930
there's an unprecedented revolution happening.
正在发生一场空前的革命。

12
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.062
And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials

13
00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:54.786
to change shape, change properties
改变形状、改变属性的能力，

14
00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.772
and even compute outside of silicon-based matter.
它的应用范围甚至超过了硅基物质。

15
00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:00.279
There's even a software called cadnano
甚至已经有了一个叫cadnano的软件

16
00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:03.062
that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes
我们可以用它来设计各种三維物体。

17
00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.146
like nano robots or drug delivery systems
比如纳米机器人或者药物传输系统，

18
00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.449
and use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.
以及利用DNA自我组装各种功能结构。

19
00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:12.522
But if we look at the human scale,
但是，如果我们再看宏观的人类社会生活，

20
00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:15.578
there's massive problems that aren't being addressed
还有很多问题没有被

21
00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:17.946
by those nanoscale technologies.
这些纳米级技术解决。

22
00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:20.045
If we look at construction and manufacturing,
如果我们看看建筑业和制造业，

23
00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:24.238
there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption
有很多效率严重低下的地方，比如能源消耗

24
00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:26.565
and excessive labor techniques.
和过多的人工技能需求。

25
00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:29.070
In infrastructure, let's just take one example.
在基础设施方面，我们举个例子，

26
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.553
Take piping.
比如说铺设管道。

27
00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:34.278
In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes
水管，我们的水管都是固定容积，

28
00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:38.737
that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.
固定流量的，除了昂贵的水泵和水阀以外。

29
00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:40.028
We bury them in the ground.
我们把它们埋在地底下，

30
00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:42.649
If anything changes -- if the environment changes,
如果有任何变动 － 比如环境变化，

31
00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.286
the ground moves, or demand changes --
地基移动或者需求改变－

32
00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:49.536
we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.
我们就得从头再来, 把它们挖出来再换新的。

33
00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:52.904
So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,
所以我建议把这两个世界结合起来，

34
00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:58.075
that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials
把纳米级上可程序化、能自我调节的材料

35
00:01:58.075 --> 00:01:59.752
and the built environment.
和生产环境结合起来。

36
00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.938
And I don't mean automated machines.
我的意思不是自动化设备。

37
00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:04.397
I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.
我指的也不仅仅是让智能机器替代人类劳动，

38
00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:08.281
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves.
而是那些可以可程序化的材料实现自我组装。

39
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:10.337
And that's called self-assembly,
这就叫做自我组装，

40
00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:14.854
which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure
一种把各个无序的零部件组成一个有序的结构的过程，

41
00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:17.347
through only local interaction.
这一切都只通过材料自身的相互作用来完成。

42
00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:20.522
So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?
那么要把它应用于人类社会生活，我们又需要些什么呢？

43
00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:22.497
We need a few simple ingredients.
我们只需要一些简单的条件，

44
00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:25.336
The first ingredient is materials and geometry,
第一个就是材料和几何形状，

45
00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:28.805
and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.
这需要和能源材料紧密结合起来。

46
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:30.463
And you can use passive energy --
我们可以用被动式能源 －

47
00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:35.147
so heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.
比如热力、抖动、气压、重力、磁力。

48
00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:38.222
And then you need smartly designed interactions.
同时我们也需要设计得非常巧妙的交互方式。

49
00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:40.355
And those interactions allow for error correction,
而且这些交互方式可以纠错，

50
00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:44.355
and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.
可以让已成型的物体改变状态。

51
00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:47.587
So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,
我现在要为大家展示我们已经做好的一些项目，

52
00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:50.871
from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional
从一维、二维、三维

53
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.938
and even four-dimensional systems.
甚至到四维的系统。

54
00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.824
So in one-dimensional systems --
在一维系统里 －

55
00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:58.731
this is a project called the self-folding proteins.
我们有个项目叫 "自我折叠蛋白质"。

56
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:03.438
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein --
思路是我们拿一个蛋白质的三維结构模型 －

57
00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:06.119
in this case it's the crambin protein --
这里我们用的是花菜蛋白 －

58
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.765
you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions --
我们拿出它的主链 － 没有交叉链接的地方或者与环境的相互作用

59
00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.916
and you break that down into a series of components.
－ 我们把它分解成一系列的组成部分。

60
00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.190
And then we embed elastic.
然后我们嵌入一定的弹性松紧度。

61
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.531
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it,
然后我把它抛向空中再接住，

62
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:22.382
it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
它就变成了蛋白质本身复杂的三維结构。

63
00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.482
And this gives us a tangible model
它为我们展示了一个形象的

64
00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:28.216
of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds
三維蛋白质模型，它是如何折叠的

65
00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:30.500
and all of the intricacies of the geometry.
以及它的几何复杂性。

66
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.948
So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.
所以我们可以利用这个实际直观的模型来研究蛋白质。

67
00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:36.750
And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems --
同时我们也把这个想法应用到二维系统里－

68
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.049
so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.
比如使平板能够自我折叠形成三維结构。

69
00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.502
In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal
对于三維系统，我们去年在TEDGlobal和Autodesk(欧特克)

70
00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:47.466
with Autodesk and Arthur Olson
以及Arthur Olson做了一个项目。

71
00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:49.164
where we looked at autonomous parts --
我们研究了分散独立的零件 －

72
00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:53.483
so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.
就是怎样让各自分散的部分自发的组合在一起。

73
00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.249
And we built 500 of these glass beakers.
我们一共做了500个这样的烧杯。

74
00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.716
They had different molecular structures inside
里面有不同的分子结构

75
00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:00.940
and different colors that could be mixed and matched.
以及不同的可以相互混杂搭配的颜色。

76
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.189
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.
我们把它们给了所有在场的TED观众。

77
00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.690
And so these became intuitive models
这些形象的模型帮助我们

78
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.182
to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.
在宏观上理解分子是如何自我组装的。

79
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.999
This is the polio virus.
这个是脊髓灰质炎病毒。

80
00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.931
You shake it hard and it breaks apart.
你使劲儿一摇，它就散架了。

81
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:14.377
And then you shake it randomly
然后你随便摇瓶子

82
00:04:14.377 --> 00:04:17.881
and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.
它就开始纠错然后自己组合成本来的结构形状。

83
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:20.848
And this is demonstrating that through random energy,
这个例子说明了我们可以利用不规则的运动能量

84
00:04:20.848 --> 00:04:25.476
we can build non-random shapes.
形成规则的物体形状。

85
00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:29.000
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.
我们甚至证明了它同样适用于更加宏观的层面。

86
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.154
Last year at TED Long Beach,
去年在TED的 Long Beach，

87
00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:34.365
we built an installation that builds installations.
我们做了一个可以制造其它设备的装置。

88
00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:37.902
The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?
想法就是我们能不能自我组装家具大小的物体呢？

89
00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.403
So we built a large rotating chamber,
所以我们做了一个大的滚动的空间，

90
00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:43.616
and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,
然后人们过来或快或慢的滚动它

91
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.201
adding energy to the system
来给这个系统增加能量

92
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.647
and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works
从而更形象的理解了自我组装是怎么一回事，

93
00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:50.026
and how we could use this
以及我们怎样

94
00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:54.772
as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.
在产品的宏观建设或制造技术上利用它。

95
00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:56.439
So remember, I said 4D.
还记得我刚才提到了四维，

96
00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.134
So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,
今天我们首次向大家展示一个新项目，

97
00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.020
which is a collaboration with Stratasys,
这是和Stratasys公司一同合作的，

98
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.855
and it's called 4D printing.
它叫做4D(四维)打印。

99
00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:05.815
The idea behind 4D printing
4D(四维)打印指的是

100
00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:08.815
is that you take multi-material 3D printing --
我们利用多材料进行三維打印 －

101
00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:11.004
so you can deposit multiple materials --
就是我们可以使用多种材料 －

102
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.888
and you add a new capability,
同时我们又新加一种能力，

103
00:05:12.888 --> 00:05:14.754
which is transformation,
就是变形。

104
00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:16.071
that right off the bed,
一但从车床上下来，

105
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:20.398
the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.
这些不同的零部件就可以直接自发的变成其他的形状，

106
00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:23.898
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.
就像是没有电线或者马达驱动的机器人。

107
00:05:23.898 --> 00:05:25.549
So you completely print this part,
所以我们把一个部分完整的打印出来，

108
00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:28.353
and it can transform into something else.
它就可以自己变成其它的物体形状。

109
00:05:28.353 --> 00:05:33.314
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.
我们也和Autodesk（欧特克）合作了他们正在开发的Project Cyborg软件。

110
00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:36.437
And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior
这个项目让我们可以模拟自我组装这种行为

111
00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:39.639
and try to optimize which parts are folding when.
以及优化哪些部件应该在何时折叠变形。

112
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.369
But most importantly, we can use this same software
但是，最重要的是，我们可以利用同样的软件

113
00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:45.277
for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems
设计纳米级的自我组装系统

114
00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:48.120
and human scale self-assembly systems.
以及人类生活中的自我组装系统。

115
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.633
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.
这些是用多材料属性打印出来的零件

116
00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.350
Here's the first demonstration.
这是第一个演示，

117
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.254
A single strand dipped in water
把一条链子浸在水里

118
00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.603
that completely self-folds on its own
它可以完全自我折叠成

119
00:05:57.603 --> 00:06:01.521
into the letters M I T.
字母M. I. T （美国麻省理工学院）。

120
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.343
I'm biased.
我确实偏心。

121
00:06:03.343 --> 00:06:06.792
This is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank
另外一个演示，把一条链子浸在一个大缸里，

122
00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:11.415
that self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.
它会自我折叠变成一个三維结构的立方体，

123
00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:13.266
So no human interaction.
没有任何人力的影响。

124
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:15.155
And we think this is the first time
我们认为这是首次

125
00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:17.402
that a program and transformation
把一个程序软件和变形

126
00:06:17.402 --> 00:06:20.652
has been embedded directly into the materials themselves.
一起直接的嵌入（应用）到材料中去。

127
00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:23.382
And it also might just be the manufacturing technique
或许这将是一种制造技术，

128
00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:27.516
that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.
能让我们在未来生产更多的可自我调节的基础设施设备。

129
00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:28.702
So I know you're probably thinking,
我知道大家现在大概会想，

130
00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:32.934
okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?
好吧，看着挺酷的，但是我们怎么把它应用到生产环境里？

131
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.189
So I've started a lab at MIT,
我在MIT（美国麻省理工学院）开展了一个实验室，

132
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:37.071
and it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.
它叫做“自我组装实验室”。

133
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.215
And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials
我们致力于为实际生产环境开发

134
00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:41.406
for the built environment.
可程序化的材料。

135
00:06:41.406 --> 00:06:43.369
And we think there's a few key sectors
我们认为有几个关键部分

136
00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.683
that have fairly near-term applications.
它们可以在相当短期内得到应用。

137
00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:47.738
One of those is in extreme environments.
其中之一就是在极限环境下。

138
00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:50.284
These are scenarios where it's difficult to build,
有些情况是建造起来非常困难，

139
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.772
our current construction techniques don't work,
我们现有的建造技术行不通的。

140
00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:56.332
it's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.
它太大，太危险，太昂贵，太庞杂。

141
00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.699
And space is a great example of that.
太空就是一个非常好的例子。

142
00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.065
We're trying to design new scenarios for space
我们正在为太空环境设计新的

143
00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:04.365
that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures
可以完全重置和自我组装的结构。

144
00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:08.055
that can go from highly functional systems from one to another.
它们可以自我转化成各种功能强大的系统。

145
00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:10.166
Let's go back to infrastructure.
我们再回到基础设施建设。

146
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:14.065
In infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.
在这个领域，我们正和波士顿一家叫Geosyntec的公司合作，

147
00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:16.865
And we're developing a new paradigm for piping.
正在开发一种新的管道模板。

148
00:07:16.865 --> 00:07:20.488
Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract
想象一下如果水管可以膨胀或者收缩

149
00:07:20.488 --> 00:07:23.238
to change capacity or change flow rate,
来改变容积、改变流量、

150
00:07:23.238 --> 00:07:27.772
or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.
它甚至可以自己起伏蠕动来传输水。

151
00:07:27.772 --> 00:07:30.382
So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.
这就不需要昂贵的水泵或者水阀了。

152
00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:34.665
This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.
这是一个完全可程序化和自我调节的管道。

153
00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:36.480
So I want to remind you today
我今天想要提醒大家的是 －

154
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.864
of the harsh realities of assembly in our world.
当今残酷的组装现实。

155
00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:43.329
These are complex things built with complex parts
这些庞杂的集合体是用复杂的零件

156
00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:46.114
that come together in complex ways.
以繁复的方式组装起来的。

157
00:07:46.114 --> 00:07:49.313
So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from
所以，我真诚的邀请大家，不管你们来自哪个领域，

158
00:07:49.313 --> 00:07:53.366
to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,
和我们一起重塑和重新想象这个世界，

159
00:07:53.366 --> 00:07:57.065
how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,
怎样将微观纳米世界和宏观人类生活的事物结合在一起。

160
00:07:57.065 --> 00:08:00.140
so that we can go from a world like this
从而，我们可以从这样一个世界过渡到

161
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.090
to a world that's more like this.
一个更类似于这样的世界。

162
00:08:12.452 --> 00:08:14.362
Thank you.
谢谢大家。

163
00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:16.663
