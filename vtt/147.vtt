00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:05.618
we've done a study called "Singles in America."

We don't poll the Match population,

151
00:07:07.474 --> 00:07:09.434
we poll the American population.

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:12.427
We use 5,000-plus people,

I see some of the same patterns.

not necessarily last year, but in their lives --

00:07:43.816 --> 00:07:46.735
I have doubted that for a long time;

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.651
the patterns are too strong.
毕竟这种模式太普遍

167
00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:51.403
There's got to be some Darwinian explanation --
肯定有某种类似于达尔文生物进化的地方

168
00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:53.753
Not that many people are crazy.
总不会是那么多人都丧失了理智？

169
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:57.665
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic that really came home to me.

170
00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:00.686
It was a very interesting academic article

178
00:08:22.408 --> 00:08:24.084

And in an age where we have too many choices,

we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease

I think people are taking their time to love.

192
00:08:58.228 --> 00:08:59.879
And actually, what's happening is,

193
00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:03.764
what we're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage

194
00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.524
before you tie the knot.

195
00:09:05.854 --> 00:09:08.580
Where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship,

196
00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:10.273
now it's the finale.

197
00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:12.973

(Laughter)
（笑声）

199
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.844
The human brain always triumphs,

200
00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:18.763
and indeed, in the United States today,
如今 在美国

201
00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:22.285
86 percent of Americans will marry by age 49.
86%的美国人将在49岁结婚

202
00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:25.855
And even in cultures around the world where they're not marrying as often,
即便在世界上结婚率不高的文化里

203
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:29.154
they are settling down eventually with a long-term partner.
最终他们也会和长期伴侣安定下来

204
00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:31.013
So it began to occur to me:
于是 我突然想到：

205
00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:35.604
during this long extension of the precommitment stage,
在这个长期婚前准备期

206
00:09:35.628 --> 00:09:38.801
if you can get rid of bad relationships before you marry,

207
00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:41.272
maybe we're going to see more happy marriages.

208
00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:46.533
So I did a study of 1,100 married people in America --
于是，我研究了美国1100位已婚人士

209
00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:48.284
not on Match.com, of course --

210
00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:50.424
and I asked them a lot of questions.
我问了很多问题

211
00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:51.955
But one of the questions was,

"Would you re-marry the person you're currently married to?"

And 81 percent said, "Yes."

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:06.912
In fact, the greatest change in modern romance and family life

215
00:10:06.936 --> 00:10:08.336
is not technology.

216
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.384
It's not even slow love.

217
00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:13.818
It's actually women piling into the job market

in cultures around the world.
大量女性进入职场的结果

And women were regarded as just as economically, socially

"Love is the crooked thing."

He said, "The dark, uneasy world of family life --
他说：在枯燥繁琐的家庭生活中

264
00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:19.914
where the greatest can fail, and the humblest succeed."

265
00:12:20.599 --> 00:12:22.486

00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:45.652
the rules that govern our relationships, I think,
以及控制双方关系的规则

297
00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:47.703
are changing fundamentally.
正在发生根本性的改变

298
00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:50.627
We come from a model that, until now,
直到最近 我们一直处于一种模式

299
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:54.114
was primarily regulated around duty and obligation,
即主要由责任和义务

300
00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:56.535
the needs of the collective and loyalty.
集体和忠诚主义支配的模式

301
00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:57.739
And we have shifted it
而现在 我们转向了另一种模式

302
00:13:57.763 --> 00:14:02.093
to a model of free choice and individual rights,
即追崇自主选择 个人权利

303
00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:05.193
and self-fulfillment and happiness.
自我实现与幸福的模式

304
00:14:05.217 --> 00:14:07.537
And so, that was the first thing I thought,
这是我脑子里冒出的第一个想法

305
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:09.329
that the need doesn't change,
爱的需求没有改变

306
00:14:09.353 --> 00:14:13.161
but the context and the way we regulate these relationships
但大环境和人们处理情感关系的方式

307
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.463
changes a lot.
发生了很大的变化

308
00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:16.327
On the paradox of choice --
关于选择悖论

309
00:14:18.502 --> 00:14:20.829
you know, on the one hand we relish the novelty
我认为 一方面我们追求

310
00:14:20.853 --> 00:14:22.445
and the playfulness, I think,
多重选择给我们带来的

311
00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:25.180
to be able to have so many options.
新鲜感和趣味性

312
00:14:25.204 --> 00:14:26.565
And at the same time,
同时

313
00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:29.003
as you talk about this cognitive overload,
就像你提到的“认知负荷”

314
00:14:29.027 --> 00:14:32.475
I see many, many people who ...
我看到许多人

315
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:38.317
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt
对堆砌成堆的选项所带来的不确定性

316
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:40.890
that comes with this massa of choice,
和不自信而感到担忧

317
00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:43.173
creating a case of "FOMO"
从而制造出某种“害怕错过的恐惧症”

318
00:14:43.197 --> 00:14:44.839
and then leading us --
于是便引领我们--

319
00:14:44.863 --> 00:14:48.178
FOMO, fear of missed opportunity, or fear of missing out --
“FOMO”，表现为害怕机会流失

320
00:14:48.202 --> 00:14:51.160
it's like, "How do I know I have found 'the one' --
就好比“我怎么知道这个人就是

321
00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:52.356
the right one?"
我命中注定的那一个呢？”

322
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.063
So we've created what I call this thing of "stable ambiguity."
这种现象我称为“稳定的模棱两可”

323
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.125
Stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone
指的是你害怕被剩下来 孤独终老

324
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:04.184
but also not really willing to engage in intimacy-building.
但又不愿打开心扉 与人建立亲密关系

325
00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:09.502
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship
这是一种策略 不仅会使这段关系的不确定性期延长

326
00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:12.133
but also the uncertainty of the breakup.
还能拖延分手的不确定性

327
00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:15.139
So, here on the internet you have three major ones.
网络上将其分为三个阶段

328
00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:17.484
One is icing and simmering,
一是冰冻期和温吞水

329
00:15:17.508 --> 00:15:20.383
which are great stalling tactics
这是很好的拖延战术

330
00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:22.884
that offer a kind of holding pattern
它使人们处于某种停滞状态

331
00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:26.702
that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship
在这种状态下 强调情感关系中的不界定属性

332
00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:30.833
but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency
但同时能让你维持这段关系

333
00:15:30.857 --> 00:15:33.614
and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries.
以及自由做出选择的空间

334
00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:35.464
(Laughter)
（笑声）

335
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.060
Yeah?
说的对吗？

336
00:15:37.084 --> 00:15:38.632
And then comes ghosting.
接下来就到了“幽灵阶段”

337
00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:40.628
And ghosting is, basically,
“幽灵阶段”基本上是指

338
00:15:40.652 --> 00:15:45.172
you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot,
你突然不再做出选择

339
00:15:45.196 --> 00:15:48.981
and you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another,
不再应对你给对方带来的痛苦

340
00:15:49.005 --> 00:15:51.603
because you're making it invisible even to yourself.
因为你自己都掩耳盗铃

341
00:15:51.627 --> 00:15:52.814
(Laughter)
（笑声）

342
00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:53.996
Yeah?
对吗？

343
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.757
So I was thinking -- these words came up for me as I was listening to you,
当我在听你演讲的时候 我想到了这些

344
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:03.944
like how a vocabulary also creates a reality,
正如语言重现现实一样

345
00:16:03.968 --> 00:16:05.523
and at the same time,
与此同时

346
00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:07.231
that's my question to you:
我也有个问题要问你：

347
00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:10.195
Do you think when the context changes,
当环境发生变化时

348
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.859
it still means that the nature of love remains the same?
你认为爱的本质还是一样的吗？

349
00:16:13.883 --> 00:16:17.981
You study the brain and I study people's relationships and stories,
你研究大脑 而我研究情侣关系

350
00:16:18.005 --> 00:16:21.991
so I think it's everything you say, plus.
我认可你的观点

351
00:16:22.511 --> 00:16:26.413
But I don't always know the degree to which a changing context ...
但我不明白的是环境改变的程度--

352
00:16:27.271 --> 00:16:29.801
Does it at some point begin to change --
它是从某一点开始改变的呢？

353
00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:32.438
If the meaning changes, does it change the need,
如果意义变了 需求是否也会改变呢？

354
00:16:32.462 --> 00:16:34.925
or is the need clear of the entire context?
或需求本身不受整个大环境影响？

355
00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:37.037
HF: Wow! Well --
海伦：哇！

356
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:39.492
(Laughter)
（笑声）

357
00:16:39.516 --> 00:16:42.691
(Applause)
（掌声）

358
00:16:42.715 --> 00:16:45.683
Well, I've got three points here, right?
海伦：好的，我分为三点来说

359
00:16:46.556 --> 00:16:48.382
First of all, to your first one:
首先，回答你第一个问题：

360
00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:51.999
there's no question that we've changed, that we now want a person to love,
人类变了，这一点毋庸置疑 现在人们依然渴望爱情

361
00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:54.868
and for thousands of years, we had to marry the right person
而几千年来 人们都遵从必须

362
00:16:54.892 --> 00:16:57.283
from the right background and right kin connection.
和来自匹配的背景和关联的人结婚

363
00:16:57.317 --> 00:17:00.538
And in fact, in my studies of 5,000 people every year,
每年我对5000人进行调研

364
00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:02.688
I ask them, "What are you looking for?"
我问他们：“你想找什么样的人？”

365
00:17:02.712 --> 00:17:05.470
And every single year, over 97 percent say --
每年 超过97%的人会说

366
00:17:05.494 --> 00:17:06.704
EP: The list grows --
诶斯特：清单越来越长了吧

367
00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:07.888
HF: Well, no.
海伦：呃，没有

368
00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:11.235
The basic thing is over 97 percent of people
超过97%的人都表示想找

369
00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:13.350
want somebody that respects them,
尊重自己

370
00:17:13.374 --> 00:17:15.662
somebody they can trust and confide in,
值得信任的 能交心的

371
00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:17.342
somebody who makes them laugh,
能逗你笑的

372
00:17:17.366 --> 00:17:19.248
somebody who makes enough time for them
花时间陪自己的

373
00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:23.269
and somebody who they find physically attractive.
以及长相看着顺眼的人

374
00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.576
That never changes.
这几点从未改变过

375
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.778
And there's certainly -- you know, there's two parts --
大概有两部分--

376
00:17:27.802 --> 00:17:29.382
EP: But you know how I call that?
诶斯特：你知道我怎么定义这种现象吗？

377
00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:31.656
That's not what people used to say --
过去人们并不是这样的择偶标准

378
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.910
HF: That's exactly right.
海伦：是的

379
00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:36.233
EP: They said they wanted somebody with whom they have companionship,
诶斯特：过去人们会说他们想找能够与自己作伴

380
00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:37.548
economic support, children.

382
00:17:40.182 --> 00:17:41.191
(Laughter)
（笑声）

383
00:17:41.215 --> 00:17:44.196
We did it in the larger culture, and we're doing it in marriage.
在其他文化中我们已经这么做了 现在我们把它带到婚姻中

384
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.768
HF: Right, no question about it.
海伦：是的，这一点毫无疑问

385
00:17:45.792 --> 00:17:49.702
But it's interesting, the millennials actually want to be very good parents,
但有趣的是 如今千禧一代非常渴望成为合格的家长

386
00:17:49.726 --> 00:17:53.846
whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage
而他们的上一代人希望有个美满的婚姻

387
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.092
but is not as focused on being a good parent.
但却不向他们一样专注于成为合格的家长

388
00:17:56.116 --> 00:17:58.199
You see all of these nuances.
你可以看到这些细微的差别

389
00:17:58.223 --> 00:18:00.779
There's two basic parts of personality:
人格有两个基本构成部分：

390
00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:04.378
there's your culture -- everything you grew up to do and believe and say --
你的文化—成长过程 信仰和言行--

391
00:18:04.402 --> 00:18:05.801
and there's your temperament.
以及性格

392
00:18:05.825 --> 00:18:08.652
Basically, what I've been talking about is your temperament.
我讨论的基本上都是性格

393
00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:11.994
And that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times
而性格一定会随着时间和信仰的改变

394
00:18:12.018 --> 00:18:13.319
and changing beliefs.
而改变

395
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:16.858
And in terms of the paradox of choice,
就选择悖论而言

396
00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:19.289
there's no question about it that this is a pickle.
这确实是个两难的境地

397
00:18:19.313 --> 00:18:22.177
There were millions of years where you found that sweet boy
千百万年以来

398
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.926
at the other side of the water hole,
如果人们在河边看到心动的对象

399
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.101
and you went for it.
便会去争取

400
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.276
EP: Yes, but you --
诶斯特：是的，但是--

401
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.047
HF: I do want to say one more thing.
海伦：还有一件事

402
00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:30.688
The bottom line is, in hunting and gathering societies,
归根结底，在狩猎及采集社会中

403
00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:34.310
they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives.
人们一生中通常有2到3个伴侣

404
00:18:34.334 --> 00:18:35.492
They weren't square!
他们并不是两两相对的

405
00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:37.172
And I'm not suggesting that we do,
我当然不是建议我们也这么做

406
00:18:37.196 --> 00:18:41.172
but the bottom line is, we've always had alternatives.
但重要的是我们始终 可以做出其他选择

407
00:18:41.196 --> 00:18:42.675
Mankind is always --
人类一直如此

408
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:45.891
in fact, the brain is well-built to what we call "equilibrate,"
实际上，人类大脑的构造是平衡对称的

409
00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:47.066
to try and decide:
去试探或下决心：

410
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.524
Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?
来或走？去或留？

411
00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:51.096
What are the opportunities here?
留下来有什么样的机遇？

412
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.422
How do I handle this there?
怎么处理这件事？

413
00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:55.407
And so I think we're seeing another play-out of that now.
我想现在上演的正是大脑决策的另一出戏

414
00:18:55.872 --> 00:18:57.495
KS: Well, thank you both so much.

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:00.725
I think you're going to have a million dinner partners for tonight!

416
00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:02.728
(Applause)
（掌声）

417
00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:03.933
Thank you, thank you.
谢谢！
