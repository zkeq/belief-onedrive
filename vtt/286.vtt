Do you look me up and down,

wondering how hot I must get

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.081
What if I wore my scarf like this?

I can walk down the street in the exact same outfit

and what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.591
depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth.

15
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.705
But this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab
这并不是又一个关于伊斯兰妇女头巾的独白

16
00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:59.681
because Lord knows, Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth
因为上帝知道伊斯兰妇女远不是一条头巾就能代表的

17
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:03.640
they choose, or not, to wrap their head in.
无论他们是否选择佩戴

18

This is about looking beyond your bias.

you'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer,

because it's true.

that surprise and the behaviors associated with it
你们感到的惊讶和作出的行为

29
00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.820

or implicit prejudice.

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:50.066
Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.
嗨，澳大利亚联邦内阁

35
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.138
(Applause)
（掌声）

36
00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:55.147
Let me just set something out from the outset:
我想先讲讲这个

37
00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.509
Unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination.
无意识偏见不同于有意识的歧视

38
00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.019
I'm not saying that in all of you,  there's a secret sexist or racist
我并非指在座各位都是秘密的性别歧视者或种族歧视者

39
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:04.661
or ageist lurking within,  waiting to get out.
或年龄歧视者你们等待着把歧视公之于众

40
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.398
That's not what I'm saying.
我并非这个意思

41
00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:08.350
We all have our biases.
我们都有自己的偏见

42
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.689
They're the filters through which we see the world around us.
偏见是我们观察这个世界的过滤器

43
00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.664
I'm not accusing anyone,
我不是在指责任何人

44
00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:15.158
bias is not an accusation.
偏见并非罪过

45
00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:17.699
Rather, it's something that  has to be identified,
反而我们需要意识到这些偏见

46
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.902
acknowledged and mitigated against.
承认偏见，减轻偏见

47
00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:22.296
Bias can be about race,
偏见可以是关于种族

48
00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:23.500
it can be about gender.
可以是关于性别

49
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.203
It can also be about class, education, disability.
也可以是关于阶级、教育程度和残障

50
00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:30.226
The fact is, we all have biases against what's different,
事实上，我们都对与众不同的事物抱有偏见

51
00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:33.155
what's different to our social norms.
对那些和社会习俗不同的事物抱有偏见

52
00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:36.179
The thing is, if we want  to live in a world
问题是如果我们希望

53
00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.314
where the circumstances of your birth
自己出身的环境

54
00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:41.755
do not dictate your future
不会决定我们的未来

55
00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:43.960
and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,
到处都是平等的机会的话

56
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.517
then each and every one of us has a role to play
那么我们每个人都要做出努力

57
00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:50.780
in making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives.
确保无意识偏见无法决定我们的命运

58
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.729
There's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias
曾有一个著名的关于性别领域中无意识偏见的实验

59
00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.457
and that's in the space of gender in the 1970s and 1980s.
那是在上世纪七八十年代

60
00:02:59.457 --> 00:03:03.492
So orchestras, back in the day, were made up mostly of dudes,
当时的交响乐团大部分都由男性组成

61
00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:06.293
up to only five percent were female.
只有5%的女性成员

62
00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:09.561
And apparently, that was because men played it differently,
显然这是因为

63
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:12.375
presumably better, presumably.
人们假设男性成员演奏得更好

64
00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:15.337
But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra
但在1952年波士顿交响乐团

65
00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:17.102
started an experiment.
开始了一项实验

66
00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:18.945
They started blind auditions.
他们开始了“盲听”选拔

67
00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:22.774
So rather than face-to-face auditions, you would have to play behind a screen.
演奏者在幕布后面演奏而不是进行面对面的试音

68
00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:24.286
Now funnily enough,
非常有趣的是

69
00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.574
no immediate change was registered
事情并没有立刻发生变化

70
00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:31.398
until they asked the audition-ers to take their shoes off before they entered the room.
直到演奏者被要求在进入试音房间前脱去鞋子

71
00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.438
because the clickity-clack  of the heels
因为光是鞋跟踩在硬木地板上的嗒嗒声

72
00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:37.648
against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away.
就足以出卖那些女性演奏者

73
00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.154
Now get this,
于是

74
00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:44.016
there results of the audition showed that there was a 50 percent increased chance
试音的结果表示

75
00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:46.946
a woman would progress past the preliminary stage.
女性演奏员通过试音前几关的机会提高了50%

76
00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:51.400
And it almost tripled  their chances of getting in.
她们最后通过的几率提高了3倍

77
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.913
What does that tell us?
这个故事告诉了我们什么呢

78
00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.749
Well, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently,
不幸的是我得告诉男士们男性并没有演奏得更好

79
00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.649
but there was the perception that they did.
只是大家这样以为罢了

80
00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.966
And it was that bias that was determining their outcome.
正是这种偏见决定了他们的结果

81
00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:06.064
So what we're doing here  is identifying and acknowledging
所以我们现在要做的就是

82
00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:07.112
that a bias exists.
认识到并且承认偏见是存在的

83
00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:08.730
And look, we all do it.
我们都有

84
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.517
Let me give you an example.
让我来举个列子

85
00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:14.295
A son and his father are in  a horrible car accident.
一个儿子和他的父亲遭遇了一场可怕的车祸

86
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.159
The father dies on impact
父亲当场死亡

87
00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.819
and the son, who's severely injured, is rushed to hospital.
而身受重伤的儿子被送去了医院

88
00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.201
The surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like,
当他们到达后外科医生看着儿子说

89
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.608
"I can't operate."
我不能进行手术

90
00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:27.514
Why?
为什么呢？

91
00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:30.720
"The boy is my son."
这个男孩是我儿子

92
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.068
How can that be?
怎么会呢？

93
00:04:32.068 --> 00:04:33.288
Ladies and gentlemen,
女士先生们

94
00:04:33.288 --> 00:04:36.154
the surgeon is his mother.
那名外科医生是他的母亲

95
00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:37.897
Now hands up -- and it's okay --
现在举手没有关系

96
00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:41.657
but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy?
但如果你最假设那名医生是男性的观众请举手。

97
00:04:42.737 --> 00:04:45.658
There's evidence that that unconscious bias exists,
有证据表明无意识偏见是存在的

98
00:04:45.658 --> 00:04:48.690
but we all just have to acknowledge that it's there
只是我们需要承认它的存在

99
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.078
and then look at ways  that we can move past it so that we can look at solutions.
并寻求解决方法

100
00:04:54.408 --> 00:05:00.177
Now one of the interesting things around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas.
在无意识偏见领域有一个很有趣的话题就是选拔问题

101
00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:02.502
And this something  that's often brought up.
这是经常会被提到的问题

102
00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:05.813
And of of the criticisms  is this idea of merit.
被诟病最多的就是有关优点这一概念

103
00:05:05.813 --> 00:05:08.985
Look, I don't want to be picked  because I'm a chick,
听着我不想因为我长得漂亮被挑选

104
00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:11.252
I want to be picked because  I have merit,
我想因为有能力而被挑选

105
00:05:11.252 --> 00:05:13.428
because I'm the best person for the job.
因为我是最适合这份工作的人

106
00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:16.327
It's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers
这是很多女性工程师都有的想法

107
00:05:16.327 --> 00:05:18.233
that I work with and that I know.
至少我共事过的我认识的都是这样

108
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.134
And yeah, I get it, I've been there.
是啊，我理解我也这样想过

109
00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:22.473
But, if the merit idea was true,
但如果真是这样的话

110
00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:27.240
why would identical resumes,  in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,
为何在耶鲁大学2012年所做的一个实验中

111
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.834
identical resumes sent out for a lab technician,
应聘实验室技术人员时发出的两份完全相同的简历

112
00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:35.050
why would Jennifers be deemed less competent,
会使得面试人认为约翰比詹妮弗能力更高

113
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.314
be less likely to be offered the job,
更有可能得到工作

114
00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:40.991
and be paid less than Johns.
得到更高的工资呢

115
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:43.444
The unconscious bias is there,
无意识偏见的确存在

116
00:05:43.444 --> 00:05:45.880
but we just have to look at how we can move past it.
只是我们需要想办法克服它

117
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.501
And, you know, it's interesting,
而且有趣的是

118
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.314
there's some research that talks about
有过很多研究

119
00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:52.166
why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox.
都在讨论这类问题这被称作优点悖论

120
00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:54.687
And in organizations -- and this is kind of ironic --
对很多机构来说有点讽刺的是

121
00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:58.514
in organizations that talk about merit being their primary value-driver
那些声称雇佣人才时

122
00:05:58.514 --> 00:05:59.886
in terms of who they hire,
首先考虑应聘者自身价值的机构

123
00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:03.381
they were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more
都更倾向于雇佣男性付给男性更高工资

124
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.988
because apparently merit  is a masculine quality.
因为优秀显然是男性的特质

125
00:06:06.988 --> 00:06:08.250
But, hey.
但是，嘿

126
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.564
So you guys think you've got  a good read on me,
所以你们以为已经了解我了

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:13.995
you kinda think you know what's up.
你们以为你们知道是怎么回事

128
00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:17.568
Can you imagine me running one of these?
但你们能想象我来做这件事吗

129
00:06:17.568 --> 00:06:19.855
Can you imagine me walking in and being like,
你们能想象我走进屋子然后说

130
00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:22.960
"Hey boys, this is what's up. This is how it's done."
嘿各位，就得这样了没办法

131
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.500
Well, I'm glad you can.
那好吧，我很欣慰你们能想象出来

132
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.983
(Applause)
（掌声）

133
00:06:37.053 --> 00:06:40.130
Because ladies and gentlemen, that's my day job.
因为女士们、先生们这就是我每天的工作

134
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.067
And the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining.
其中好的一点就是这做起来挺愉快的

135
00:06:43.067 --> 00:06:44.755
Actually, in places like Malaysia,
其实在马来西亚这类地方

136
00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:47.215
Muslim women on rigs  isn't even comment-worthy.
船上的穆斯林女人不足为奇

137
00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:48.584
There are that many of them.
因为她们比比皆是

138
00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:49.812
But, it is entertaining.
但是有时候挺有趣的

139
00:06:49.812 --> 00:06:51.869
I remember, I was telling one of the guys,
我记得我对一个男人说

140
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.440
"Hey, mate, look, I really want  to learn how to surf."
嘿，老兄我真的很想学冲浪

141
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.001
And he's like, "Yassmin, I don't know how you can surf
然后他说Yassmin我真的不知道你该怎么冲浪

142
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:59.372
with all that gear you've got on,
因为你穿成那样

143
00:06:59.372 --> 00:07:02.046
and I don't know any women-only beaches."
而且我也不知道有只允许女人去的海滩

144
00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:04.330
And then, the guy came up  with a brilliant idea,
紧接着这个人想出了一个绝妙的点子

145
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.588
