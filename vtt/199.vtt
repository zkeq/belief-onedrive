1
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.820
For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,
对于我来说，这个故事是15年前开始的。

2
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.820
when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.
当时我是芝加哥大学安养院的医生，

3
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families
在芝加哥的南边地区

4
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.820
in the South Side of Chicago.
照顾临终的病人和他们的亲属。

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.820
And I was observing what happened to people and their families
我借此来观察疾病晚期

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.820
over the course of their terminal illness.
病人和家属所经历的一切。

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,
而在我的实验室里，我当时正在研究“寡妇效应”，

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.820
which is a very old idea in the social sciences,
是社会科学中非常古老的一个观点，

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
going back 150 years,
可追述到150年前，

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.820
known as "dying of a broken heart."
当时被称为是“心碎之死”。

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,
举个例子来说，如果我去世的话，

12
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.820
for instance, in the first year.
我妻子在我逝世之后一年的死亡率会加倍。

13
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,
我当时照料的病人中，有一位

14
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820
a woman who was dying of dementia.
是正死于痴呆症的女士。

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.820
And in this case, unlike this couple,
和夫妻的例子不同的是，

16
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820
she was being cared for
当时照顾这位女士的

17
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
by her daughter.
是她的女儿。

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.
这个女儿因为照顾老母而筋疲力竭，

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.820
And the daughter's husband,
而女儿的丈夫

20
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.820
he also was sick
也因为妻子的疲劳

21
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.820
from his wife's exhaustion.
而患上疾病。

22
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820
And I was driving home one day,
有一天我正开车回家，

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,
收到一通来自这个丈夫的朋友的电话，

24
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820
calling me because he was depressed
原因是因为他为他朋友所经历的一切

25
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.820
about what was happening to his friend.
感到忧郁。

26
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.820
So here I get this call from this random guy
我就这样神奇地接到一个陌生人的电话，

27
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820
that's having an experience
全因为他的经历

28
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
that's being influenced by people
受到了一些

29
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.820
at some social distance.
和他有一定“社会距离”的人的影响。

30
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
And so I suddenly realized two very simple things:
我也因此突然意识到了两件很简单的事情。

31
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820
First, the widowhood effect
首先，是“寡妇效应”

32
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
was not restricted to husbands and wives.
不仅仅局限于丈夫和妻子之间。

33
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.820
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.
其二，它也不仅仅局限于两个人之间。

34
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.820
And I started to see the world
我开始以全新的视角

35
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820
in a whole new way,
观察这个世界，

36
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
like pairs of people connected to each other.
将世界看成是成双成对联系在一起的人们。

37
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.820
And then I realized that these individuals
我随后又意识到这些人，如果俩俩相配，

38
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.
便会变成四人小组。

39
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.820
And then, in fact, these people
事实上，这些人

40
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820
were embedded in other sorts of relationships:
都身处在其他各种人际关系中──

41
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.820
marriage and spousal
婚姻、伴侣、

42
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820
and friendship and other sorts of ties.
友情、等等。

43
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
And that, in fact, these connections were vast
事实上，这些关联是如此之广泛，

44
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.820
and that we were all embedded in this
我们所有人都身处在这个广博的网络中，

45
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
broad set of connections with each other.
与彼此相连。

46
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
So I started to see the world in a completely new way
所以我开始以全新的角度看待这个世界，

47
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.820
and I became obsessed with this.
并沉迷其中。

48
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.820
I became obsessed with how it might be
我为我们是如何陷入这些社会网络中而着迷

49
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820
that we're embedded in these social networks,
也为这些网络是如何影响我们的生活

50
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
and how they affect our lives.
而着迷。

51
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.820
So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,
这些社会网络是错综的艺术之作，

52
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.820
and they're so elaborate and so complex
它们是如此的精致、如此复杂、

53
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820
and so ubiquitous, in fact,
如此无所不在，使得我们不得不询问

54
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.820
that one has to ask what purpose they serve.
它们存在的意义是什么。

55
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
Why are we embedded in social networks?
我们为什么会身陷这些社会网络中？

56
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?
它们是如何成立的？是如何工作的？

57
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
And how do they effect us?
它们是如何影响我们的？

58
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.820
So my first topic with respect to this,
而我据此的第一个研究课题，

59
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.820
was not death, but obesity.
不是死亡，而是肥胖症。

60
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.820
It had become trendy
突然间，讨论肥胖症的流行

61
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
to speak about the "obesity epidemic."
变成了一个热门的话题。

62
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.820
And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,
我与我的同事James Fowler

63
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.820
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic
开始研讨肥胖症是否真的是一种流行病，

64
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.820
and could it spread from person to person
是否可以从一个人传染到另一个人身上，

65
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.820
like the four people I discussed earlier.
就如我之前讨论的那四个人一样。

66
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.820
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.
这里看到的是我们的初步研究结果。

67
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.
这是2000年接受研究的2200人。

68
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.820
Every dot is a person. We make the dot size
每个圆点代表着一个人。圆点的大小

69
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.820
proportional to people's body size;
和人的身形正比。

70
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.820
so bigger dots are bigger people.
所以大的圆点代表身形大的人。

71
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820
In addition, if your body size,
除此之外，如果你的体重指数

72
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.820
if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --
超过30的话，

73
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.820
if you're clinically obese --
如果你被诊断有肥胖症，

74
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.820
we also colored the dots yellow.
我们便把圆点涂成黄色。

75
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see
如果你这么大略地看看这张图的话，

76
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
that there are clusters of obese and
你也许可以看到肥胖的人和非肥胖的人

77
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.820
non-obese people in the image.
有聚集的显现。

78
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.820
But the visual complexity is still very high.
但是这个视觉复杂性还是很高的，

79
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.820
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.
很难确切地说清其中的关联。

80
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.820
In addition, some questions are immediately raised:
如此之外，很多问题也立即产生。

81
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.820
How much clustering is there?
到底有多少聚集？

82
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.820
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?
所产生的聚集是不是要比单纯的巧合下所产生的聚集要多？

83
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.820
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?
聚集的大小是怎样？可以触及到多远？

84
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820
And, most importantly,
最重要的是，

85
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
what causes the clusters?
聚集的原因是什么？

86
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.820
So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.
所以我们用数学的办法研究了一下这些聚集的大小。

87
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.820
This here shows, on the Y-axis,
在这里可以看到，纵轴上代表的是

88
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.820
the increase in the probability that a person is obese
如果一个人的社会联系人中有人患有肥胖症的话，

89
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.820
given that a social contact of theirs is obese
那么这个人患有肥胖症的几率会增加多少；

90
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.820
and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.
横轴上代表的是，这两个人之间的分离指数。

91
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.820
On the far left, you see the purple line.
在最左端，你看到那条紫色线。

92
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.820
It says that, if your friends are obese,
它显示如果你的朋友们有肥胖症，

93
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.820
your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.
你肥胖的可能性就会高出45%。

94
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820
And the next bar over, the [red] line,
接下来的那条红色线

95
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.820
says if your friend's friends are obese,
现实如果你的朋友的朋友们有肥胖症，

96
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.820
your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.
你患肥胖症的可能性就会高出25%。

97
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.820
And then the next line over says
下一条线显示

98
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.820
if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,
如果你朋友的朋友的朋友──你可能都不认识这个人──患有肥胖症的话，

99
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.820
your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.
你患肥胖症的可能性就会高出10%。

100
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.820
And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends
一直追溯到你朋友的朋友的朋友的朋友的时候，

101
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.820
that there's no longer a relationship
这层关系才会消失，

102
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.820
between that person's body size and your own body size.
这个人的身形和你的身形才不再会有关联。

103
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.820
Well, what might be causing this clustering?
所以，造成这种聚集的原因有哪些呢？

104
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.820
There are at least three possibilities:
至少有三种可能。

105
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.820
One possibility is that, as I gain weight,
第一种就是当我体重增加时，

106
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820
it causes you to gain weight.
也导致了你的体重增加，

107
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.820
A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.
类似电磁感应，由一个人传到另一个人。

108
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.820
Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,
另一种可能，很显然，就是同类的聚合效应，

109
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.820
or, birds of a feather flock together;
物以类聚、人以群分。

110
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.820
here, I form my tie to you
我之所以和你建立关系

111
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.820
because you and I share a similar body size.
正是因为我们俩身形相似。

112
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.820
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,
而最后一种可能，叫做混杂因素，

113
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.820
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.
因为它模糊我们找到真正原因的能力。

114
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain
这意味着我的增肥

115
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.820
is causing your weight gain,
并没有直接导致你体重增加，

116
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.820
nor that I preferentially form a tie with you
我也不是因为咱俩身形相似

117
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.820
because you and I share the same body size,
才和你建立关系，

118
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.820
but rather that we share a common exposure
而是因为我们俩都接触到了相同的经历，

119
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.820
to something, like a health club
比如说健康俱乐部，

120
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.820
that makes us both lose weight at the same time.
导致我们俩同时减肥。

121
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.820
When we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,
而当我们进一步研究这些数据的时候，我们发现了支持这三种可能的证据，

122
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820
including for induction.
包括磁场感应。

123
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.820
And we found that if your friend becomes obese,
我们发现如果你的朋友患有肥胖症，

124
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.820
it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent
你在同一时期，患肥胖症的可能性

125
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820
in the same given time period.
会增加57%。

126
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.820
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:
造成这一现象的机理可以有很多。

127
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.820
One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --
一种可能是你的朋友对你说──

128
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.820
you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --
他们的行为传染了你，

129
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.820
like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"
比如他们会说：“咱俩一起去吃点糕点，喝瓶啤酒吧。”，

130
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.820
which is a terrible combination. (Laughter)
致命的搭配

131
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.820
But you adopt that combination,
但你还是接受了这个搭配，

132
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.820
and then you start gaining weight like them.
你也开始和你朋友一般开始增肥。

133
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.820
Another more subtle possibility
另一个潜在的可能性

134
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.820
is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas
是当他们开始增肥的时候，你对合理身形的概念

135
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.820
of what an acceptable body size is.
也随之发生了改变。

136
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820
Here, what's spreading from person to person
在这种情况下，从一个人传到另一个人身上的

137
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.820
is not a behavior, but rather a norm:
不再是行为，而是准则。

138
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820
An idea is spreading.
一个想法在得以蔓延。

139
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.820
Now, headline writers
一些新闻头条记者

140
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.820
had a field day with our studies.
借机盗用我们的研究。

141
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.820
I think the headline in The New York Times was,
我记得当时《纽约时报》的头条是

142
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.820
"Are you packing it on?
“你越来越肥吗？

143
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.820
Blame your fat friends." (Laughter)
怪罪你的那些肥朋友吧。”

144
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.820
What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers
我们觉得很有趣的是，欧洲的头条记者们

145
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.820
had a different take: They said,
对此有不同的理解，他们的头条是：

146
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.820
"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."
“你的朋友增肥了吗？也许你要自责一下。”

147
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.820
(Laughter)
（笑声）

148
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.820
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,
我们觉得这是对美国的一种很有趣的评论，

149
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.820
and a kind of self-serving,
一种事不关己、高高挂起，

150
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.820
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.
明哲保身的现象。

151
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.820
Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work
在这里我要澄清一下，我们并不认为

152
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
should or could justify prejudice
我们的研究支持

153
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.820
against people of one or another body size at all.
对某一种身材的歧视。

154
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.820
Our next questions was:
我们的下一个问题是：

155
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.820
Could we actually visualize this spread?
我们能否在视觉上直接观看这种传染现象？

156
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.820
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading
体重的增加真的是从一个人身上

157
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.820
to weight gain in another person?
传到另一个人身上吗？

158
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.820
And this was complicated because
这就变得很复杂了

159
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.820
we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,
因为我们要考虑到这个网络的结构、

160
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.820
the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.
关系之间的建筑构造，是随时都在变的。

161
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.820
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,
更何况，肥胖症并不是只有单一的中心的流行病，

162
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --
没有肥胖流行病的“零号病人”──

163
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.820
if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him --
如果找到这个人，那么肥胖症就是从他那边传出来的。

164
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820
it's a multicentric epidemic.
但相反，肥胖病的流行有多个中心，

165
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.820
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.
多个人都在同时做着同样的事情。

166
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.820
And I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation
我将向你们展示一段30秒钟的视频演示，

167
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.820
that took me and James five years of our lives to do.
是花了我和James五年的人生才做好的。

168
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.820
So, again, every dot is a person.
同样的，每个圆点都是一个人。

169
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.820
Every tie between them is a relationship.
每条连线都代表着某种人际关系。

170
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.820
We're going to put this into motion now,
我们先在就要让它动起来，

171
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.820
taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.
在30年间对这个网络进行每天的切割。

172
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.820
The dot sizes are going to grow,
圆点变得越来越大，

173
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.820
you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.
你将看到一整片黄色的侵略，

174
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.820
You're going to see people be born and die --
也会看到人的出生与死亡，

175
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.820
dots will appear and disappear --
圆点将会出现、又消逝。

176
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.820
ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,
人际关系成立又瓦解。婚姻与离异，

177
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.820
friendings and defriendings.
友情与断交，

178
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.820
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening
非常复杂，在短短30年间

179
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.820
just in this 30-year period
很多事情在发生，

180
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.820
that includes the obesity epidemic.
包括了肥胖的流行。

181
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.820
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters
在结尾处，你们将会看到

182
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.820
of obese and non-obese individuals
肥胖者和非肥胖者在这个网络中

183
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.820
within the network.
出现扎堆的现象。

184
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.820
Now, when looked at this,
通过这个演示，

185
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.820
it changed the way I see things,
我看待事物的方式得以改变，

186
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.820
because this thing, this network
因为这个网络，

187
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.820
that's changing across time,
这个随时间而变换的网络，

188
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.820
it has a memory, it moves,
是有记忆的，它移动着，

189
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.820
things flow within it,
其中的事物随其所动，

190
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.820
it has a kind of consistency --
它拥有着一种持久性；

191
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.820
people can die, but it doesn't die;
其中的人也许死去，但它去不会死去；

192
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.820
it still persists --
它仍旧持续着。

193
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.820
and it has a kind of resilience
它有着一种坚韧性，

194
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.820
that allows it to persist across time.
允许它恒久不变。

195
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.820
And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks
所以我开始将这些社会网络的所散发信号

196
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.820
as living things,
看作是活着的事物，

197
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.820
as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope
可以放到显微镜下来

198
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.820
to study and analyze and understand.
研究、分析、理解。

199
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.820
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.
我们用各种各样的技术来做到这一点。

200
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.820
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
我们开始研究其他的各种现象。

201
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.820
We looked at smoking and drinking behavior,
我们查看了吸烟和喝酒行为，

202
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.820
and voting behavior,
投票行为，

203
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.820
and divorce -- which can spread --
离婚──也是可以传染的，

204
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.820
and altruism.
还有自闭症。

205
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.820
And, eventually, we became interested in emotions.
最终，我们对情感产生了兴趣。

206
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.820
Now, when we have emotions,
当我们有情感的时候，

207
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.820
we show them.
我们会将它们呈现出来。

208
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820
Why do we show our emotions?
我们为什么要展示我们的情感呢？

209
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.820
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing
内在地感受情感，比如快乐与愤怒，

210
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.820
our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.
当然是有其好处，

211
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.820
But we don't just experience them, we show them.
但我们不单单是感受它们，我们也展示它们。

212
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.820
And not only do we show them, but others can read them.
我们不仅仅展示它们，其他人也可以阅读它们。

213
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.820
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.
其他人不仅仅可以阅读它们，他们也可以复制它们。

214
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.820
There's emotional contagion
在人类社群中，就有着

215
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.820
that takes place in human populations.
情感的传染。

216
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.820
And so this function of emotions
情感的这一功能

217
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.820
suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,
就表示除了其他的作用之外，

218
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.820
they're a kind of primitive form of communication.
情感也是一种原始的表达方式。

219
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.820
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,
事实上，如果我们想真正地了解人类的情感，

220
00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.820
we need to think about them in this way.
就要以这种方式来思考它们。

221
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.820
Now, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,
我们已经习惯了在简单、简短的时间段内

222
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.820
in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.
来考虑情感。

223
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.820
So, for example,
打个比方来说，

224
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.820
I was giving this talk recently in New York City,
我最近在纽约市演讲，

225
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.820
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway
其中说到：“当你在地铁上，

226
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.820
and the other person across the subway car
车厢对面的人

227
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.820
smiles at you,
向你微笑时，

228
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820
and you just instinctively smile back?"
你会下意识地回报以微笑。”

229
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.820
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)
他们看着我，说到：“我们纽约人才不会做那种事情。”

230
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.820
And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,
我说：“世界上其他地方的人都会做，

231
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.820
that's normal human behavior."
是人之常理。”

232
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.820
And so there's a very instinctive way
所以我们有一种很本能的方式

233
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.820
in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.
在短时间内把情感传递给彼此。

234
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.820
And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.
事实上，情感的传染可以更广阔一些，

235
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.820
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,
比如在暴乱中，我们会加强

236
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.820
as in riots.
愤怒的表情。

237
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.820
The question that we wanted to ask was:
我们想要问的问题是：

238
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.820
Could emotion spread,
情感的传递能否超越

239
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.820
in a more sustained way than riots, across time
地铁车厢上相互微笑的一小部分人，

240
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.820
and involve large numbers of people,
而是以比暴乱更持久的方式，长时间地

241
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.820
not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?
在更多人之间传播？

242
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.820
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot
也许我们平静的表面下都蕴藏着某种

243
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.820
that animates us all the time.
时刻激荡着我们的某种暴乱。

244
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.820
Maybe there are emotional stampedes
也许有某种情感蜂拥

245
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.820
that ripple through social networks.
在社会网络中溅起涟漪。

246
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.820
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,
也许事实上，情感是有一种共有的存在性，

247
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.820
not just an individual existence.
不单单是个人的存在性。

248
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.820
And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.
这是我们用来研究这一现象所做出的早期图象之一。

249
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.820
Again, a social network,
同样是一个社会网络，

250
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.820
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy
不过这一次我们把快乐的人涂成了黄色，

251
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.820
and blue if they're sad and green in between.
难过的人涂成了蓝色，介于两者之间的人涂成了绿色。

252
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.820
And if you look at this image, you can right away see
如果你看看这幅图片，你立马就能看到

253
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.820
clusters of happy and unhappy people,
快乐的人和不快乐的人扎堆出现，

254
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.820
again, spreading to three degrees of separation.
同样地是传递到三层分离关系。

255
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.820
And you might form the intuition
你的直觉也许会告诉你

256
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.820
that the unhappy people
不快乐的人

257
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.820
occupy a different structural location within the network.
在这个网络中占据着一个不同的结构点。

258
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.820
There's a middle and an edge to this network,
这个网络有个中心部分、有个边缘地带，

259
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.820
and the unhappy people seem to be
而不快乐的人好像都集中在

260
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.820
located at the edges.
边缘地带。

261
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.820
So to invoke another metaphor,
再打个比方，

262
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.820
if you imagine social networks as a kind of
如果你把这些社区网络想象成是

263
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.820
vast fabric of humanity --
一大块人类的绸缎──

264
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.820
I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --
我与你相连，你和她相连，无止境地延伸──

265
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.820
this fabric is actually like
这块绸缎就好像是

266
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.820
an old-fashioned American quilt,
美国老实的被子一样，

267
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.820
and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.
上面是一块块的补丁，有快乐的补丁，也有不快乐的。

268
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.820
And whether you become happy or not
而你快乐与否

269
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.820
depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.
就决定于你是否身处一块快乐补丁上。

270
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.820
(Laughter)
（笑声）

271
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.820
So, this work with emotions,
所以像情感这种如此基础的东西

272
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.820
which are so fundamental,
都能按此来工作，

273
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.820
then got us to thinking about: Maybe
我们不得不猜想，

274
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.820
the fundamental causes of human social networks
也许社会网路的基本原因

275
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.820
are somehow encoded in our genes.
是写在我们的基因中的。

276
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.820
Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,
因为人类的社会网络，每当构造起来的时候，

277
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.820
always kind of look like this:
总是会和这个网络的图片

278
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.820
the picture of the network.
很相似，

279
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.820
But they never look like this.
但它们却从来不会是这个样子的？

280
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.820
Why do they not look like this?
它们为什么不是这个样子的呢？

281
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.820
Why don't we form human social networks
为什么我们不组成一个个有规则的格子框架的

282
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.820
that look like a regular lattice?
社会网络呢？

283
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.820
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,
人类社会网络惊人的样貌、

284
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.820
their ubiquity and their apparent purpose
其无所不在的特性和它们显而易见的功能，

285
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.820
beg questions about whether we evolved to have
让我们猜想社会网络是否是我们

286
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.820
human social networks in the first place,
进化的产物，

287
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.820
and whether we evolved to form networks
而我们又是否进化出具有某种特殊结构的

288
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.820
with a particular structure.
社会网络。

289
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.820
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though,
首先注意...要想搞懂这一切

290
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.820
we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --
我们必须先把这个网络结构分解一下，

291
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.820
and notice that every person in this network
注意到每个人在这个网络中的结构点

292
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.820
has exactly the same structural location as every other person.
和另外的每个人都是一样的。

293
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.820
But that's not the case with real networks.
但在真实的网络中，却不是这个样子的。

294
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.820
So, for example, here is a real network of college students
好比说，这是东北部一所顶尖大学内

295
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.820
at an elite northeastern university.
大学生之间的真实网络图。

296
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.820
And now I'm highlighting a few dots.
我这里着重挑选了几个圆点，

297
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.820
If you look here at the dots,
如果你仔细看看这些圆点，

298
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.820
compare node B in the upper left
把左上角的点B

299
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.820
to node D in the far right;
和最右边的点D做比较。

300
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.820
B has four friends coming out from him
B有四个朋友从他那里延伸出来，

301
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.820
and D has six friends coming out from him.
D则是有六个朋友。

302
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.820
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.
所以这两个人的朋友数量有所不同──

303
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.820
That's very obvious, we all know that.
这是显而易见的，我们都知道。

304
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.820
But certain other aspects
但社会网络结构中的其他方面

305
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.820
of social network structure are not so obvious.
就没有这么明显了。

306
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.820
Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.
把左上角的点B和左下角的点A做比较。

307
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.820
Now, those people both have four friends,
他俩都有四个朋友，

308
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.820
but A's friends all know each other,
但是A的朋友们彼此相知，

309
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.820
and B's friends do not.
B的朋友们却不是。

310
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.820
So the friend of a friend of A's
所以A的一个朋友的朋友

311
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.820
is, back again, a friend of A's,
反过来还是A的朋友，

312
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.820
whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,
而B的一个朋友的朋友倒不一定是B的朋友，

313
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.820
but is farther away in the network.
而是在网络中的更远处。

314
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.820
This is known as transitivity in networks.
这就是网络中的可传递性。

315
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.820
And, finally, compare nodes C and D:
最后再来比较点C和点D，

316
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.820
C and D both have six friends.
两者都有六个朋友，

317
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.820
If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"
如果你问他们：“你的社交生活怎样？”

318
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.820
they would say, "I've got six friends.
他们会说：“我有六个朋友。

319
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.820
That's my social experience."
这就是我的社交经历。”

320
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.820
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,
但我们来鸟瞰这个网络，

321
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.820
can see that they occupy very different social worlds.
我们就会发现他们的社交圈是完全不同的。

322
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.820
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:
接下来的这个问题就可以培养你这方面的直觉：

323
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.820
Who would you rather be
如果一种致命的病毒在这个网络里得以扩散，

324
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.820
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?
你希望你是其中的哪一位？

325
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.820
Would you rather be C or D?
你是想当C还是想当D？

326
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.820
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.
你当然是想当D，处在网络的边缘。

327
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820
And now who would you rather be
如果一条跟你无关的八卦新闻

328
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.820
if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --
在这个网络里散播，

329
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.820
was spreading through the network? (Laughter)
你又会想当谁呢？

330
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.820
Now, you would rather be C.
这次你会想当C。

331
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.820
So different structural locations
所以不同的结构点

332
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.820
have different implications for your life.
对你的人生有着不同的影响。

333
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.820
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,
事实上，我们的实验结果表明

334
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.820
what we found is that 46 percent of the variation
朋友数量的差异

335
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.820
in how many friends you have
有46%都是可以通过基因

336
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.820
is explained by your genes.
得以解释。

337
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.820
And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy
这并不奇怪。因为我们知道，有的人生来腼腆，

338
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.820
and some are born gregarious. That's obvious.
有的人生来合群。这是显而易见的。

339
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.820
But we also found some non-obvious things.
但我们也发现了一些不是那么明显的东西。

340
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.820
For instance, 47 percent in the variation
比如，你的朋友们是否认识彼此

341
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.820
in whether your friends know each other
其中47%的差异

342
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.820
is attributable to your genes.
都是和你的基因有关。

343
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820
Whether your friends know each other
你的朋友们是否认识彼此

344
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.820
has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.
不仅仅和他们自己的基因有关，也和你的基因有关。

345
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.820
And we think the reason for this is that some people
我们认为其中的原因就在于有的人

346
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.820
like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are --
喜欢把自己的朋友介绍给彼此──没错，说的就是你──

347
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.820
and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.
而其他人喜欢把朋友们分开，不喜欢介绍给彼此。

348
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.820
And so some people knit together the networks around them,
所以有些人将他们身边的网络们编织在一起，

349
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.820
creating a kind of dense web of ties
构成了紧密相联的深层网络，

350
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820
in which they're comfortably embedded.
而他们则是舒服地身处其中。

351
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820
And finally, we even found that
最后，我们甚至发现

352
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.820
30 percent of the variation
人们是身处网络中心还是边缘

353
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.820
in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network
30%的差异

354
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.820
can also be attributed to their genes.
也是和他们的基因相关。

355
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.820
So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge
所以你是在中心还是边缘，

356
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.820
is also partially heritable.
有一部分是遗传的。

357
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.820
Now, what is the point of this?
说这一起的目的是什么呢？

358
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.820
How does this help us understand?
如何加深我们的理解？

359
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.820
How does this help us
如何帮助我们

360
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.820
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?
解决现今与我们生活息息相关的各种问题呢？

361
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.
我的论点是这些社会网络充满价值。

362
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.820
They are a kind of social capital.
他们好比一种社交资产。

363
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820
New properties emerge
由于我们身陷其中，

364
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820
because of our embeddedness in social networks,
新的网络属性会出现，

365
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.820
and these properties inhere
而这些属性是继承在

366
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.820
in the structure of the networks,
网络的结构之中，

367
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.820
not just in the individuals within them.
不仅仅是在网络中的个人身上。

368
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.820
So think about these two common objects.
所以想想这两个日常用品，

369
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.820
They're both made of carbon,
他们都是由碳做成的，

370
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.820
and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it
不过其中的一个是由碳原子以独特的方式

371
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.820
that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --
组合而成的，形成了左手边的石墨，

372
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.820
and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.
柔软和漆黑。

373
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.820
But if you take the same carbon atoms
但如果你将相同的碳原子

374
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.820
and interconnect them a different way,
以不同的方式关联到一起，

375
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.820
you get diamond, which is clear and hard.
就会得到钻石，透彻而坚硬。

376
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.820
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness
而这些柔软、坚硬、漆黑和透彻的属性

377
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.820
do not reside in the carbon atoms;
并不是存在于碳原子本身中。

378
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.820
they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,
而是存在于碳原子之间的联系中，

379
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.820
or at least arise because of the
或者至少是由于这些联系

380
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.820
interconnections between the carbon atoms.
所造成的。

381
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.820
So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people
同样的，人与人之间的关联形态

382
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.820
confers upon the groups of people
也是赋予了各组群

383
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.820
different properties.
不同的属性。

384
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.820
It is the ties between people
正是人与人之间的关联

385
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.820
that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
使得这个世界要比单单各部分的总和伟大许多。

386
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.820
And so it is not just what's happening to these people --
所以不仅仅是这些人所经历的事情──

387
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.820
whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,
他们在减肥还是在增肥，在变富还是在变穷，

388
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.820
or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us;
在快乐还是在不快乐──影响着我们；

389
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.820
it's also the actual architecture
同时影响我们的

390
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.820
of the ties around us.
还有我们彼此关系所组成的实质结构。

391
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.820
Our experience of the world
我们在这个世界的经历

392
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.820
depends on the actual structure
取决于我们所处网络的

393
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.820
of the networks in which we're residing
实质结构，

394
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.820
and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow
以及激荡和流动于这个网络中的

395
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.820
through the network.
各种事物。

396
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.820
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case
我认为，其原因就在于

397
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.820
is that human beings assemble themselves
人类可以组织在一起

398
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.820
and form a kind of superorganism.
组成一个“超级生物体”。

399
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.820
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals
这个“超级生物体”就好像是每个个体的集合，

400
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.820
which show or evince behaviors or phenomena
展示或标注某些无法在个体层面上研究的

401
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.820
that are not reducible to the study of individuals
行为和现象，

402
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.820
and that must be understood by reference to,
是只能通过对整体的探讨和研究

403
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.820
and by studying, the collective.
来获得了解，

404
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.820
Like, for example, a hive of bees
就好比一窝

405
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.820
that's finding a new nesting site,
寻找新的筑巢之地的蜜蜂；

406
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.820
or a flock of birds that's evading a predator,
又好比是一个躲避捕食者的鸟群；

407
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.820
or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom
或是可以集中智慧、

408
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.820
and navigate and find a tiny speck
辨清方向、找到太平洋之中飘荡小岛的

409
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.820
of an island in the middle of the Pacific,
鸟群；

410
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.820
or a pack of wolves that's able
抑或是可以捕捉巨大猎物的

411
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.820
to bring down larger prey.
狼群。

412
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.820
Superorganisms have properties
超级生物体的特性

413
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.820
that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.
是无法通过对个体的研究得以完全理解的。

414
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.820
I think understanding social networks
我认为通过对社会网络的理解，

415
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.820
and how they form and operate
研究它们是如何构成和运行的，

416
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.820
can help us understand not just health and emotions
能够帮助我们了解不仅仅是健康和情感，

417
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.820
but all kinds of other phenomena --
还有许多其他的各种现象

418
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.820
like crime, and warfare,
比如犯罪和福利

419
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.820
and economic phenomena like bank runs
以及经济现象比如银行挤兑

420
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.820
and market crashes
和市场崩盘，

421
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.820
and the adoption of innovation
再有就是新技术的引用

422
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.820
and the spread of product adoption.
以及产品使用的扩展。

423
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.820
Now, look at this.
看看这个。

424
00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.820
I think we form social networks
我认为我们组建社会网络的原因

425
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.820
because the benefits of a connected life
是因为一个与人相连的生活模式

426
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.820
outweigh the costs.
要利大于弊。

427
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.820
If I was always violent towards you
如果我总是对你很暴力

428
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.820
or gave you misinformation
给你错误的信息

429
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.820
or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,
或是使你难过，或是让你染上致命的疾病，

430
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.820
you would cut the ties to me,
你就会和我断交，

431
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.820
and the network would disintegrate.
这个网络也就会瓦解。

432
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.820
So the spread of good and valuable things
所以好的、有价值的事物的传播

433
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.820
is required to sustain and nourish social networks.
是维持、滋润社会网络的必要条件。

434
